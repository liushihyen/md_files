u.s.-china economic  and security review commission

november 19, 2024

The Honorable Patty Murray
President Pro Tempore of the U.S. Senate, Washington, DC 20510
The Honorable Mike Johnson
Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, Washington, DC 20510

dear senator murray  and speaker Johnson:

On behalf of the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Com-
mission, we are pleased to transmit the Commission’s 2024 Annual
Report to Congress. This Report responds to our mandate “to moni-
tor, investigate, and report to Congress on the national security im-
plications  of  the  bilateral  trade  and  economic  relationship  between
the  United  States  and  the  People’s  Republic  of  China.”  The  Com-
mission  reached  a  broad  and  bipartisan  consensus  on  the  contents
of this Report, with all 12 members voting unanimously to approve
and submit it to Congress.

In accordance with our mandate, this Report, which is current as
of  October  11,  2024,  includes  the  results  and  recommendations  of
our  hearings,  research,  and  review  of  the  areas  identified  by  Con-
gress  in  our  mandate,  as  defined  in  Public  Law  No.  106–398  (Octo-
ber  30,  2000)  and  amended  by  Public  Laws  No.  107–67  (November
12,  2001),  No.  108–7  (February  20,  2003),  109–108  (November  22,
2005),  No.  110–161  (December  26,  2007),  No.  113–291  (December
19,  2014),  and  No.  117-286  (December  27,  2022). The  Commission’s
charter,  which  includes  the  11  directed  research  areas  of  our  man-
date, is included as Appendix I of the Report.

The  Commission  conducted  six  public  hearings,  taking  testimony
from  59  expert  witnesses  from  government,  the  private  sector,  aca-
demia,  think  tanks,  research  institutions,  and  other  backgrounds.
For  each  of  these  hearings,  the  Commission  produced  a  transcript
(posted  on  our  website  at  www.USCC.gov). This  year’s  hearings  in-
cluded:

 • Current  and  Emerging  Technologies  in  U.S.-China  Economic

and National Security Competition;

 • Consumer  Products  from  China:  Safety,  Regulations,  and  Sup-

ply Chains;

 • China’s  Evolving  Counter  Intervention  Capabilities  and  Impli-
cations  for  the  United  States  and  Indo-Pacific  Allies  and  Part-
ners;

 • China and the Middle East;

 • Key  Economic  Strategies  for  Leveling  the  U.S.-China  Playing

Field: Trade, Investment, and Technology; and

 • China’s Stockpiling and Mobilization Measures for Competition

and Conflict.

The Commission received a number of briefings, both unclassified
and  classified,  by  executive  branch  agencies,  the  intelligence  com-
munity,  foreign  government  officials,  and  U.S.  and  foreign  nongov-
iii

ernmental  experts  on  topics  such  as  Europe’s  views  on  China,  the
impact  of  Article  23  on  Hong  Kong,  Taiwan’s  priorities  under  the
new  Lai  Administration,  the  climate  for  U.S.  businesses  in  Hong
Kong, China’s overhead surveillance capabilities, and U.S.-China re-
lations. The Commission includes key insights gained through these
briefings either in its unclassified Annual Report or, as appropriate,
in a classified annex to that Report.

The Commission conducted official fact-finding travel this year to
Taiwan and Japan to hear and discuss regional perspectives on the
United States’ relations with China as well as trans-Pacific coopera-
tion. In these visits, the Commission delegation met with U.S. diplo-
mats, foreign government officials, business representatives, academ-
ics,  journalists,  and  other  experts.  In  Taiwan,  Commissioners  were
received by President Lai Ching-te and discussed the importance of
strong  U.S.-Taiwan  relations  in  the  face  of  China’s  increasing  coer-
cive  activities.  The  Commission  also  conducted  official  fact-finding
travel  to  U.S.  Indo-Pacific  Command,  U.S.  Central  Command,  and
U.S.  Special  Operations  Command  to  hear  their  insights  on  the  ef-
forts our military is undertaking to counter challenges presented by
China. The Commission also relied substantially on the work of our
excellent professional staff (see Appendix IV) in accordance with our
mandate (see Appendix I).

The  Report  includes  32  recommendations  for  congressional  con-
sideration. The  Commissioners  agreed  that  ten  of  these  recommen-
dations,  which  appear  on  page  27,  are  the  most  important  for
congressional action. The complete list of recommendations appears
on page 733 at the conclusion of the Report.

We offer this Report to Congress in the hope that it will be useful
in  helping  guide  policies  for  the  U.S.-China  relationship  that  ad-
vance American interests and values. Thank you for the opportunity
to  serve.  We  look  forward  to  continuing  to  work  with  Members  of
Congress  in  the  upcoming  year  to  address  issues  of  concern  in  the
U.S.-China relationship.

Sincerely,

Robin Cleveland

In  2024,  under  the  leadership  of  General  Secretary  Xi  Jinping,
the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) continued to pursue a technol-
ogy-focused  strategy  to  drive  rapid  military  modernization,  expand
internal political surveillance and suppression of dissent, and assert
China’s  political  and  economic  agenda  in  the  international  arena.
At  the  same  time,  amid  a  domestic  property  market  collapse,  weak
consumer demand, and rising debt and employment challenges, the
Party leadership has aggressively continued to advance its econom-
ic,  political,  and  security  goals  through  non-market  practices.  Xi
clearly has calculated that these approaches are not only paramount
in  defining  his  leadership  and  claiming  China’s  global  role,  but  are
also  essential  to  addressing  its  endemic  economic  weaknesses  and
further tightening the Party’s grip on the economy and society. The
centralized  top-down  approach  is  reminiscent  of  Mao-era  authori-
tarianism.  With  few  remaining  avenues  for  dissent  and  a  political
system that demands absolute loyalty to the individual leader, it has
become  unlikely  that  anyone  could  dissuade  Xi  should  he  decide  to
take actions that risk igniting a catastrophic conflict.

The  CCP’s  efforts  to  consolidate  economic  control  are  evident  in
numerous  ways:  its  systematic  restriction  of  access  to  national  fi-
nancial and economic data as well as basic corporate data necessary
for  due  diligence  and  safety  controls,  security  threats  to  foreigners
engaged  in  business  in  China,  persistent  pressure  on  foreign  gov-
ernment  partners  to  conduct  trade  in  renminbi,  and  the  concentra-
tion  of  resources  and  support  for  state-owned  enterprises  (SOEs).
Although  Xi  has  consistently  emphasized  the  importance  of  small
and medium-sized enterprises in providing jobs and accelerating in-
novation,  the  data  show  that  the  CCP’s  post-COVID  policies  have
strengthened  the  position  of  SOEs.  From  June  2021  to  June  2024,
of  the  top  100  firms  listed  on  Chinese  exchanges,  SOEs’  share  of
aggregate market capitalization grew to 54 percent, rising from $2.7
trillion to $3.2 trillion. Over the same period, non-public enterprises’
share of market capitalization dropped to 33 percent and aggregate
revenue stagnated. While the increased flow of resources into SOEs
may serve the Party’s short-term interests, other challenges remain.
In  the  past  two  years,  Chinese  universities  have  graduated  record
levels of students who are finding the market offers jobs they do not
want or needs skills they do not have.

Ignoring  the  advice  of  many  of  his  own  economists  and  financial
leaders,  Xi  has  taken  limited  steps  to  open  markets  and  boost  con-
sumer  spending  and  confidence.  Instead,  China  is  reinforcing  its
longstanding,  market-distorting  approach  of  massive  subsidies  to
targeted  industries,  this  time  focusing  on  high-tech  manufacturing
in  order  to  unleash  “new  quality  productive  forces”  and  generate
more  earnings  through  its  exports  and  traditional  dumping  ap-

proaches. Designed to strengthen self-sufficiency and achieve global
dominance  in  key  sectors—including  but  not  limited  to  advanced
and legacy semiconductor chips, aviation, advanced batteries, robot-
ics,  and  artificial  intelligence—China’s  strategy  is  also  intended  to
integrate  it  more  deeply  into  global  supply  chains  and  continue  to
increase  every  other  country’s  dependence  on  it  for  a  wide  array  of
goods and materials. As the United States and its partners move to
further  curb  access  to  military  and  dual-use  technologies  and  ad-
dress  China’s  blatant  disregard  for  global  norms  and  international
agreements, China is shifting production overseas to circumvent re-
strictions  while  expanding  its  own  access  to  critical  minerals,  mar-
kets, key enabling technologies and tools, and labor. Because its sub-
sidized goods undercut foreign competitors, China’s approach comes
at the expense of both advanced and emerging economies.

In  2024,  the  United  States,  Canada,  and  the  EU  have  increased
efforts  to  review  both  incoming  and  outgoing  investment  flows,
strengthen  trade  investigation  and  enforcement  actions,  and  ap-
ply  export  controls  and  sanctions.  The  intensification  of  recent  ef-
forts  reflects  rising  concern  with  Chinese  predatory  and  debt-trap
practices  and  control  of  resources  essential  to  our  defense  capabil-
ities,  along  with  expansion  of  China’s  dominance  in  multiple  mar-
ket  sectors.  Countries  in Asia, Africa,  and  Latin America  have  also
launched  trade  remedy  investigations  and  imposed  new  tariffs  on
Chinese  imports.  Nevertheless,  these  responses  have  been  largely
uncoordinated as individual countries and international institutions
struggle to address the scale of China’s economy, its integration into
global supply chains, and its defiance of WTO and other internation-
al agreements and norms.

China has sought to strengthen its international position through
bilateral  coercion  to  secure  economic,  trade,  and  security  agree-
ments with select countries and by manipulating international and
regional  institutions  to  win  collective  support  of  China’s  policy  po-
sitions.  Of  importance  is  China’s  aggressive  and  coercive  effort  to
convince other countries to adopt statements endorsing its positions
on Taiwan, Tibet, Xinjiang, and more. At the recent triennial Forum
on China-Africa Cooperation, representatives of 53 of the 55 African
members  adopted  a  declaration  pledging  to  support  “all  efforts”  by
China  to “reunify”  with Taiwan. According  to  the  Chinese  Loans  to
Africa  database  released  by  the  Boston  University  Global  Develop-
ment  Policy  Center,  at  least  49  of  the  53  signatories  have  received
loan commitments from China or Chinese lenders.

China’s  quest  for  “multipolarization”  aims  to  create  a  world  in
which the United States and its democratic allies are weakened and
constrained, while states such as China, Russia, Iran, and North Ko-
rea have free rein to threaten their neighbors and defy any notion of
universally agreed-upon norms or a rules-based international order.
In  2024,  NATO  issued  its  strongest  criticism  of  China  to  date,  la-
beling it a “decisive enabler” of Russia’s war in Ukraine. China con-
tinues to provide substantial support for Russia’s war of aggression
against  Ukraine  by  exporting  vital  dual-use  goods  that  power  Rus-
sia’s  military  while  shielding  Russia’s  economy  from  international
sanctions.  Similarly,  with  respect  to  Iran,  China’s  oil  purchases

3

equate to about 90 percent of that country’s government budget, en-
abling Tehran to finance terrorist groups and other regional proxies.
In  the  Indo-Pacific,  China’s  aggressive  actions  have  expanded.  In
addition  to  launching  its  first  intercontinental  ballistic  missile  test
into the South Pacific in more than 40 years, China has engaged in
large-scale  military  exercises  around Taiwan  that  for  the  first  time
involved  the  China  Coast  Guard.  It  has  pursued  violent  actions  in
contravention  of  international  law  against  Philippine  vessels  in  an
attempt  to  block  the  resupply  to  Second Thomas  Shoal  in  the  Phil-
ippines’ exclusive economic zone. It has also increased the tempo of
incursions, the weapons onboard, and the number of ships entering
waters  around  the  Japanese-administered  Senkaku  Islands  in  the
East China Sea. These actions are part of a troubling and persistent
trend  of  escalation  of  pressure  with  the  goal  of  asserting  China’s
claim of authority and control across the region. China’s approach
has  strengthened  U.S.  efforts  to  enhance  security  cooperation  and
base access arrangements with allies and partners in the region.

As  China  continues  to  pursue  its  goal  of  displacing  the  United
States  as  the  leading  global  power,  Xi’s  consolidation  of  personal
authority  has  increased  the  risk  of  miscalculation  and  conflict.  Xi
has attempted to compensate for China’s poor economic performance
by further strengthening his grip over the Party and the Party’s grip
over  government,  the  military,  and  society.  Xi  continued  to  purge
high-level officials from the national security establishment and im-
posed  stricter  disciplinary  measures  on  rank-and-file  Party  mem-
bers.  In  Hong  Kong,  through  the  imposition  of  a  new  national  se-
curity ordinance, China has further quashed the city’s once vibrant
civil society and increased the Mainland’s control.

Looking  forward  to  2025,  even  as  China’s  economy  falters,  the
CCP  will  continue  to  pursue  its  geopolitical  ambitions,  strengthen
the  Party-state,  attempt  to  “sanctions  proof ”  its  financial  position,
and reduce Western leverage in the event of a conflict. A clearly co-
ordinated, U.S.-led effort to build a coalition of like-minded countries
and  more  closely  align  trade  and  investment  policies  is  an  essen-
tial step in responding to China’s ambitions. The United States will
need to strengthen work with allies and partners to build consensus
domestically and internationally on the full range of policies needed
to defend our shared interests and values from the threat posed by
China and its partners as they seek to increase their power, extend
their reach, and reshape global norms to reflect the interests of their
authoritarian regimes.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Part I: The Year in Review
Chapter  1:  U.S.-China  Economic  and  Trade  Relations  (Year

in Review)

China’s economy grew in 2024, albeit at a much slower pace than
it did pre-pandemic. Chinese officials have introduced stimulus mea-
sures  throughout  the  year,  including  a  series  of  announcements  in
September  and  October  that  will  likely  provide  a  short-term  boost
to  economic  growth.  While  the  latest  stimulus  round  has  the  po-
tential  to  be  among  the  largest  China  has  passed  to  deal  with  the
current  crisis,  the  measures  are  insufficient  in  scale  compared  to
the  scope  of  China’s  economic  challenges,  and  their  long-term  im-
pact  is  questionable.  The  fallout  from  the  property  sector  collapse
continues  to  be  China’s  largest  domestic  economic  headwind  and
a  source  of  weakness  for  local  government  finances  and  consumer
spending.  Officials  remain  focused  on  mitigating  systemic  economic
risks  and  achieving  a  controlled  deflation  of  the  property  bubble
rather than reversing the sector’s decline. Although Chinese policy-
makers have repeatedly stated their intention to increase the contri-
butions  of  services  and  consumption  to  economic  growth,  in  reality,
China has doubled down on a variant of its traditional manufactur-
ing  and  export  model.  China  has  increased  government  subsidies
and  targeted  supply-side  stimulus  toward  favored  industries,  espe-
cially those involving advanced technology. The Chinese Communist
Party’s  (CCP’s)  prioritization  of  supply-side  policies  aims  to  further
strengthen  China’s  manufacturing  base  and  increase  its  self-suffi-
ciency  while  simultaneously  increasing  Party-state  control  over  do-
mestic  capital  allocation  and  global  supply  chains  and  increasing
dependency by other nations. While this strategy has led to China’s
emergence as a leader in the manufacture and export of goods such
as  solar  panels  and  electric  vehicles  (EVs),  China’s  export  of  ex-
cess  capacity  is  leading  to  increasingly  aggressive  pushback  from
China’s  major  trading  partners  and  the  imposition  of  tariffs  by  the
United States, the EU, and others. Meanwhile, uncertainty over Chi-
na’s economy and heightened geopolitical tensions have weighed on
investment  in  China.  A  shift  in  U.S.  imports  toward  Mexico,  Viet-
nam,  and  other  economies  suggests  that  a  broader  diversification
of  trade  away  from  China  may  be  emerging.  Due  to  the  deliberate
restructuring  of  supply  chains  to  avoid  U.S.  tariffs,  many  imports
from third countries still contain parts and materials that originate
in China.

China intensified its economic statecraft with the rest of the world
as  it  seeks  to  promote  its  alternative  frameworks  for  economic  de-
velopment and cooperation. In defiance of the U.S.-led sanctions re-
gime,  China  continues  to  offer  material  support  to  Russia,  acting
(5)

6

opportunistically  to  win  energy  concessions  and  promote  alterna-
tive  payment  systems.  Meanwhile,  China  has  retooled  its  flagship
Belt  and  Road  Initiative  to  limit  its  exposure  to  default  risks.  It  is
again  increasing  lending  throughout  the  developing  world,  though
this  time  mainly  in  the  form  of  emergency  rescue  loans  to  bail  out
indebted countries rather than fund new infrastructure projects. As
advanced  economies  implement  tariffs,  China  is  shifting  exports  of
manufactured  goods  to  emerging  economies,  enlarging  its  bilateral
trade  surpluses  across  the  developing  world.  Concerned  about  the
impact of rising Chinese imports on their own prospects for develop-
ment, some emerging economies have launched trade investigations
or imposed tariffs to protect domestic industries.

Key Findings

 • Chinese authorities have reasserted and expanded control over
the economy centrally, regionally, and locally. General Secretary
of  the  CCP  Xi  Jinping’s  vision  for  future  economic  growth  in
China  is  politically  driven  and  differs  from  Western  economic
orthodoxy.

 • The  continuing  slowdown  in  economic  expansion  has  led  to
greater reliance on specific growth drivers, allocating capital to
those  targeted  sectors  and  exporting  excess  capacity  to  sustain
growth.

 • China  continues  to  rely  on  manufacturing  and  exports  to  drive
growth  while  also  trying  to  move  up  the  value  chain  to  pro-
duce  and  export  high-technology  goods.  This  growth  strategy
assumes  the  rest  of  the  world  will  continue  to  absorb  China’s
excess  capacity  at  the  expense  of  their  own  domestic  manufac-
turing and technology sectors.

 • China has pivoted from an emphasis on aggregate gross domes-
tic  product  growth  to  a  strategy  that  targets  “higher  quality”
production  in  emerging  technologies.  China  hopes  that  becom-
ing a dominant producer of high-tech goods will allow it to side-
step systemic economic problems and enhance its overall global
economic position and national power.

 • Substantial risks remain in the property sector, which have al-
ready  had  serious  ramifications  for  the  Chinese  economy.  The
CCP  introduced  new  support  measures  for  the  property  sector
in  2024  and  helped  local  government  financing  vehicles  refi-
nance  maturing  debt.  However,  the  scale  of  unfinished  housing
and  the  large  amount  of  local  and  regional  government  debt
far  exceeds  the  amount  of  capital  allocated  for  financial  sup-
port.  These  issues  may  weigh  down  economic  performance  in
the near future as households await delivery of apartments for
which they have made substantial down payments and develop-
er bond defaults reverberate through the financial sector.

 • While  Chinese  data  measuring  youth  unemployment  have
shown  recent  improvement,  China’s  college-educated  youth  are
growing  more  pessimistic  about  their  personal  financial  sit-
uation  as  they  continue  to  enter  a  workforce  that  prioritizes
manufacturing jobs they do not want and focuses on skills they

7

do  not  have.  A  combination  of  slowing  growth  post-pandemic
and targeted policy crackdowns have weakened some consumer
technologies and other service sectors that previously employed
a large majority of youths. To the extent that the CCP’s societal
legitimacy is based on delivering economic growth and opportu-
nity,  the  increase  in  youth  unemployment  has  called  that  into
question.

 • The  CCP  has  directed  state-owned  banks  and  asset  managers
to  intervene  to  prop  up  the  stock  market  and  issue  credit  to
state-owned  enterprises  (SOEs)  and  regional  and  local  govern-
ments on favorable terms. As long as these measures remain a
common  practice,  Chinese  households  will  remain  skeptical  of
passive  long-term  domestic  investment  opportunities  as  a  way
to generate wealth, forcing them to save a larger share of their
income.  Uncertainty  regarding  Chinese  investment  opportuni-
ties dampens China’s attempts to bolster consumption.

Chapter  2:  U.S.-China  Security  and  Foreign  Affairs  (Year  in

Review)

In  2024,  China  sought  to  mitigate  internal  and  external  risks
by  exercising  a  combination  of  coercive  and  persuasive  strategies
abroad  and  continuing  to  tighten  political  control  at  home.  Inter-
nationally,  China  attempted  to  promote  itself  as  the  world  leader
best  positioned  to  solve  and  prevent  conflicts,  represent  low-  and
middle-income  countries,  and  promote  economic  growth  while  also
making  it  clear  that  it  opposed  U.S.  policies  and  alliance  relation-
ships. In its diplomacy with the United States, China sought to use
the  promise  of  bilateral  dialogues  on  narrow  areas  of  common  in-
terest  to  derail  what  it  perceives  as  the  United  States’  policy  of
strategic competition. It also aimed to tighten ties with Europe and
encourage  divisions  within  the  transatlantic  alliance  but  continued
to  undermine  its  own  credibility  through  its  intensifying  economic,
military,  diplomatic,  and  political  support  for  Russia.  At  the  same
time, China is increasingly providing support and resources to coun-
tries  involved  in  military  operations  against  Western  allies.  China
has  turned  a  blind  eye  as  Iran  and  North  Korea  act  in  ways  that
undermine  global  stability,  and  it  has  demonstrated  willingness  to
exploit  tensions  in  the  Middle  East  for  geopolitical  gain.  Overall,
China  reacted  to  other  countries’  efforts  to  protect  their  economic
and  physical  security  by  portraying  them  as  hostile,  exclusionary,
and  destabilizing.  In  the  case  of  the  South  China  Sea,  China  re-
sorted  to  more  dangerous,  violent  actions.  China  also  expanded  its
campaign  to  persuade  Pacific  Island  states  to  adopt  Beijing’s  pre-
ferred  policies  on  a  range  of  issues  and  intensified  its  longstand-
ing  diplomatic  efforts  in Africa,  Latin America,  and  the  Caribbean.
Despite the willingness of some governments to deepen cooperation
with  Beijing  in  various  domains,  many  other  countries  remained
deeply skeptical of China’s intentions and proposals.

Domestically,  the  year  saw  a  further  consolidation  of  the  CCP’s
control  over  the  state  bureaucracy  and  a  continued  concentration
of  power  within  the  Party  into  the  hands  of  General  Secretary  Xi.
To  combat  persistent  problems  of  corruption  and  fears  of  political
disloyalty,  Xi  and  a  small  circle  of  top  leaders  tightened  their  grip

8

on  the  Party  rank  and  file  while  continuing  to  unseat  and  in  some
cases  disappear  high-ranking  figures  across  the  government  and
military.  Meanwhile,  the  CCP  increased  emphasis  on “political  dis-
cipline”  across  Party  ranks  and  introduced  new  Party  loyalty  tests,
including potential removal from internal Party positions for simple
acts  like “privately  reading,  browsing,  and  listening  to  newspapers,
books,  audio-visual  products,  electronic  reading  materials,  and  on-
line materials with serious political problems.” In 2024, the People’s
Liberation Army (PLA) also announced a major reorganization that
elevated the importance of space, cyber, and information capabilities
and  created  three  new  forces  under  the  more  direct  control  of  the
top military leadership, led by Xi.

Key Findings

 • As part of its efforts to solidify its control across the Party, state,
and  military,  in  2024  the  CCP  leadership  introduced  new  mea-
sures on political discipline and anticorruption, targeting every-
one from low-ranking Party members to senior military officers.
From the top of the system, Xi delivered dire messages to Party
and  military  audiences  on  the  severity  of  remaining  problems,
revived some Maoist concepts and slogans, and emphasized the
importance  of  political  loyalty  and  enduring  hardship.  China’s
leaders  viewed  enhanced  domestic  control  as  a  key  factor  in
China’s ability to accomplish its domestic and international ob-
jectives.

 • China  continues  to  assert  that  the  United  States  poses  inten-
sifying  strategic  risk.  Despite  a  bilateral  agreement  reached  in
late  2023  to  pursue  limited  cooperation  on  military  communi-
cation,  climate  change,  countering  fentanyl  and  other  drugs,
artificial  intelligence  (AI),  and  people-to-people  ties,  China  has
continued its efforts  to counter or weaken U.S.  policies  without
changing  its  own  behavior.  Fundamental  divergences  on  issues
such  as Taiwan  and  access  to  markets,  capital,  and  technology
remain.

 • In 2024, China accelerated efforts to build international support
from as many countries as possible—with a focus on the devel-
oping  nations  of  what  it  calls  the  “Global  South”—for  China’s
claims to global leadership, its continuing efforts to isolate and
subjugate  Taiwan,  and  its  desired  forms  of  economic  coopera-
tion. At  the  same  time,  Beijing  sought  to  portray  actions  taken
by  the  United  States  and  many  of  its  allies  and  partners  to
protect their own interests and established global norms as un-
dermining the prospects for peace, stability, and prosperity and
the future of collective international progress led by China. (For
information  on  China’s  activities  in  the  Middle  East  in  2024,
see Chapter 5, “China and the Middle East.”)

 • China  and  Russia  committed  to  further  deepening  their  joint
efforts  against  the  United  States.  China  has  sustained  its  eco-
nomic,  diplomatic,  political,  and  material  support  for  Russia’s
war effort in Ukraine. China also provided satellite imagery and
dual-use  materials  that  Russia  is  using  for  the  reconstitution
of its defense industry—such as weapons components, machine

9

tools, and microelectronics—all while claiming to play a leading
role in advancing a political solution to the conflict. In exchange
for  such  support,  Moscow  has  reportedly  provided  submarine,
aeronautic, and missile technologies to Beijing as defense coop-
eration between the two countries continues to strengthen.
 • China  sought  to  counteract  a  deteriorating  strategic  relation-
ship  in  Europe,  using  mainly  positive  rhetoric  and  promises  of
deepened cooperation to persuade the EU and individual Euro-
pean  countries  to  distance  themselves  from  the  United  States
and  abandon  their  efforts  to  de-risk  relations  with  China.  Xi
tried  to  reframe  Europe’s  economic  dependencies  on  China  as
the  byproducts  of  a  beneficial  symbiosis,  to  downplay  political
differences,  and  to  emphasize  supposed  shared  interests  in  the
creation of a more equal international system.

 • China’s destabilizing behavior in the Indo-Pacific region contin-
ued.  China’s  naval  and  coast  guard  presence  around  the  Japa-
nese-administered  Senkaku  Islands  and  flights  near  Japanese
airspace  in  the  East  China  Sea  represented  a  significant  es-
calation  from  previous  activity.  In  the  South  China  Sea,  Chi-
na’s aggressive behavior escalated to new levels in 2024 as the
China Coast Guard (CCG) took increasingly aggressive, unsafe,
and  even  violent  measures  to  attempt  to  block  the  Philippines,
a  U.S.  treaty  ally,  from  exercising  its  lawful  rights  in  its  exclu-
sive economic zone (EEZ). China’s officials continued to leverage
lawfare  tactics  to  attempt  to  normalize  their  efforts  to  impose
their  will  upon  other  countries  in  the  region  through  coercive
and illegal actions, superior force, and numbers.

Part II: Technology and Consumer Product
Opportunities and Risks
Chapter 3: U.S.-China Competition in Emerging Technologies
The  United  States  is  locked  in  a  long-term  strategic  competition
with  China  to  shape  the  rapidly  evolving  global  technological  land-
scape.  Innovation  in  emerging  technologies  could  transform  society,
create  new  industries,  foster  new  dependencies,  and  alter  the  char-
acter  of  warfare.  Whichever  country  secures  a  lead  in  key  technol-
ogies—particularly  those  with  first  mover  advantages—will  tip  the
balance  of  power  in  its  favor  and  reap  economic  benefits  far  into
the  21st  century.  China  under  General  Secretary  Xi  has  recognized
the potential advantages of seizing the innovation “high ground” in
this  competition  and  has  aggressively  designed,  implemented,  and
funded programs to dominate technologies of the future. In doing so,
Beijing  hopes  its  efforts  will  underpin  national  rejuvenation,  mak-
ing the country powerful, self-sufficient, and impervious to perceived
technological  “containment”  from  the  United  States  and  its  allies
and partners.

China has focused on developing emerging technologies such as AI,
quantum information science (QIS), biotechnology, and battery ener-
gy storage systems. The race for superior AI across industries relies
on successfully bringing together enabling technologies and building
blocks, including advanced chips, computing power, well-designed al-

10

gorithmic  models,  and  rich  datasets  for  model  training.  While  the
United  States  has  a  lead  in  most  of  these  AI-related  categories,
China  is  making  rapid  advancements  and  has  demonstrated  some
ability to innovate around U.S. and allied export controls. QIS is still
in its infancy, yet it may eventually spawn paradigm-shifting break-
throughs  enabling  computation  and  remote  sensing  at  a  speed  and
scale  heretofore  impossible.  Quantum  breakthroughs  could  provide
technology  capable  of  easily  breaking  existing  encryption,  ensuring
secure  communications,  solving  complex  computations  rapidly  and
at  scale,  and  accelerated  processing  of  military  data  to  provide  a
decisive  edge  on  the  battlefield.  China  is  regarded  by  some  experts
as  leading  in  the  subfield  of  quantum  communications,  while  the
United  States  maintains  a  lead  in  quantum  computing  and  quan-
tum  sensing.  In  the  field  of  biotechnology,  China  is  quickly  closing
the  innovation  gap  with  the  United  States  in  novel  biopharmaceu-
tical,  genomic,  and  new  material  applications.  Moreover,  Chinese
biopharma companies have expanded their footprint internationally
and become integral in U.S. drug development and bio-manufactur-
ing supply chains. Finally, due in large part to substantial and sus-
tained  subsidies,  Chinese  companies  have  established  a  global  lead
in  battery  energy  storage  systems.  China  has  consolidated  control
over  much  of  the  battery  supply  chain,  from  upstream  mining  and
processing  of  critical  minerals  to  mid-  and  downstream  production
of battery components and end products such as batteries for EVs.

China’s  rapid  progress  in  establishing  itself  as  a  leader  in  these
emerging  and  foundational  technology  fields  raises  a  host  of  eco-
nomic  and  national  security  concerns  for  the  United  States,  from
questions of dependence and economic leverage to potential threats
to  U.S.  military  superiority. The  United  States  has  realized  the  im-
portance of technology competition with China and has significantly
altered the policy environment around key technologies, particularly
semiconductors, advanced computing, and clean energy. China faces
many  challenges,  including  these  U.S.  policies,  a  faltering  domestic
economy, and inefficiencies inherent in its state-directed innovation
system. However, despite these challenges, China’s rapid technolog-
ical  progress  threatens  U.S.  economic  and  military  leadership  and
may  erode  deterrence  and  stability  in  the  Pacific  as  well  as  tip  the
global balance of power.

Key Findings

 • The  CCP  is  prioritizing  research  in  key  emerging  technology
areas  such  as  AI,  quantum  technology,  biotechnology,  and  bat-
teries  with  the  goal  of  becoming  a  world  leader  in  science  and
technology. Xi is placing a bet that China’s investments in high-
tech  industries  will  unleash  “new  quality  productive  forces,”
transcend  an  old  growth  model  reliant  on  infrastructure  and
lower-technology  exports,  and  help  China  achieve  its  goal  of
becoming  a  superpower  in  the  21st  century.  China’s  focus  on
emerging  technologies  is  also  motivated  by  its  desire  to  attain
self-sufficiency in what its leaders describe as “chokepoint” tech-
nologies  amid  an  international  environment  they  perceive  as
increasingly hostile and to better prepare for a potential conflict
with the United States over Taiwan or in other contingencies.

11

 • China’s  state-centric  approach  and  heavy  investments  in  do-
mestic  innovation  reflect  similar  techno-nationalist  initiatives
dating back to the Mao Zedong era. Under Xi, these efforts have
intensified  as  the  Party  has  sought  to  impose  tighter  top-down
control  in  the  innovation  ecosystem  to  make  breaking  depen-
dencies on foreign technologies a focal point.

 • The United States and China are neck-and-neck, with one being
ahead or behind depending on the specific critical and emerging
technology.  On  certain  manufacturing-intensive  technologies,
like  advanced  batteries  and  EVs,  China’s  various  efforts  have
enabled its companies to obtain a clear advantage.

 • Artificial  intelligence:  China  is  making  rapid  advancements
and  noteworthy  investments  in  its  AI  capabilities.  It  is  devel-
oping  AI  not  only  to  advance  China’s  economic  growth  more
broadly  but  also  for  military  applications,  such  as  autonomous
unmanned  systems,  data  processing,  decision-making,  and  cog-
nitive  warfare.  Across  key  aspects  of  AI  competition,  however,
China is having mixed success.
 ○ Advanced  semiconductors:  The  United  States  and
like-minded countries currently have an advantage in the ad-
vanced semiconductors needed to power AI technologies. Chi-
na is aggressively working to address this deficit.

 ○ Compute  and  cloud:  The  United  States  leads  in  total  com-
pute  and  cloud,  but  several  Chinese  companies  have  notable
cloud capabilities. Further, the nature of cloud computing cre-
ates a heightened threat of “leakage” into China of advanced
compute capabilities located outside of China.

 ○ AI  models:  The  United  States  currently  leads  the  world  in
developing  robust  AI  models,  but  China  is  pursuing  numer-
ous  government-led  and  ostensibly  private  efforts  to  develop
advanced AI models.

 ○ Data:  Data  are  critical  to  AI  capabilities.  Each  country  has
certain advantages in terms of collection, use, and availability
of  data  for AI  systems.  China  understands  the  value  of  data
to AI and has taken active measures to increase the availabil-
ity of quality data within its AI ecosystem.

 • Quantum  technologies:  Both  the  United  States  and  China
are  heavily  funding  research  in  quantum  computing,  sensing,
and communications, the three subdomains that together make
up  QIS. While  QIS  is  still  in  an  early  stage  of  development,  it
will  have  significant  competitive  and  military  impacts  if  it  be-
comes commercially viable. China’s Party-state drives quantum
research  through  support  to  a  major  state  laboratory  in Anhui
Province  as  well  as  a  growing  roster  of  state-backed  startup
companies.  China  appears  to  be  an  early  leader  in  quantum
communications,  launching  the  world’s  first  quantum  commu-
nications  satellite  and  connecting  two  ground  stations  with
quantum  key  distribution.  In  other  areas,  China  appears  to  be
lagging  behind  the  United  States,  though  its  scientists  have
claimed  breakthroughs  in  cracking  encrypted  communications

12

systems and developing advanced radar technology, claims that
are difficult to confirm.

 • Biotechnology: Biotechnology is another key emerging technol-
ogy  with  the  potential  for  transforming  many  industries.  Chi-
na  aims  to  use  biotechnologies  to  make  itself  less  dependent
on U.S. agriculture while embedding Chinese firms in U.S. food
production  and  supply  chains  in  genomic,  pharmaceutical,  and
other biotechnologies. The major research and market presence
of Chinese genomic and biotech services companies in the Unit-
ed States gives these companies access to key technologies and
data.

 • Advanced  batteries:  China  has  attained  a  sizable  advantage
at  each  stage  of  the  battery  supply  chain,  ushering  in  rapid
global market share increases for Chinese EV and battery mak-
ers.  China’s  near  monopoly  on  battery  manufacturing  creates
dependencies  for  U.S.  auto  manufacturers  reliant  on  upstream
suppliers  as  well  as  potential  latent  threats  to  U.S.  critical  in-
frastructure from the ongoing installation of Chinese-made bat-
tery energy storage systems throughout U.S. electrical grids and
backup systems for industrial users.

Chapter  4:  Unsafe  and  Unregulated  Chinese  Consumer
Goods:  Challenges  in  Enforcing  Import  Regulations  and
Laws

The  rapid  escalation  of  e-commerce  sales  impedes  U.S.  efforts  to
ensure  the  safety  and  regulatory  compliance  of  consumer  products
flooding the market from China. These new channels, combined with
China’s  reinvigorated  focus  on  export  manufacturing  as  a  pillar  of
economic  growth,  mean  that  Chinese  factories  will  remain  major
suppliers  across  the  consumer  products  space.  Though  the  quality
of goods sourced from China has improved somewhat over the past
two  decades  as  a  result  of  increased  due  diligence  and  monitoring
on the factory floor, significant exceptions remain, and overall prod-
uct  quality  and  safety  still  fall  short  of  U.S.  standards.  Many  Chi-
nese  companies  that  disregard  manufacturing  best  practices  utilize
cross-border  e-commerce  channels  to  send  products  directly  to  con-
sumers under a de minimis exemption that provides duty-free entry
for  small  parcel  shipments. A  continually  rising  flood  of  small  par-
cels  at  U.S.  ports  of  entry  compounds  the  difficulty  of  detecting  po-
tentially  risky  products  before  they  reach  households  and  children.
Holding Chinese manufacturers and exporters accountable remains
challenging—if  not  virtually  impossible—under  the  Xi  regime.  Ef-
forts  by  oversight  agencies,  including  the  U.S.  Consumer  Product
Safety  Commission,  to  protect  U.S.  consumers  have  been  hampered
by  falsification  of  safety  documents,  the  rise  of  small  parcel  ship-
ments,  and  lack  of  responsiveness  from  many  Chinese  exporters.
In  the  event  that  a  Chinese  made  product  causes  injury  or  hazard,
U.S.  regulatory  agencies  have  no  authority  to  unilaterally  order  an
immediate  recall  of  the  item,  and  often  have  limited  other  options
to protect consumers.

Accurate data on consumer product imports are crucial to enforce-
ment, but an increased number of Chinese exporters are seeking to
exploit loopholes in U.S. law and disguise the nature and/or origins

13

of their imports to dodge higher tariffs on products from China. Du-
ty-free  entry  under  de  minimis  provides  a  means  for  some  Chinese
manufacturers to avoid China-specific tariffs. Unscrupulous Chinese
entities also take advantage of the import channel to funnel fentan-
yl-related  materials  into  the  North  American  market,  fueling  the
illicit  supply  of  synthetic  opioids  in  the  United  States.  Other  firms
employ a wide range of illegal and deceptive tactics to lower or evade
U.S. import duties. Trade misinvoicing and other U.S. customs viola-
tions  have  grown  more  widespread  since  2018. Trade  data  indicate
that some countries have emerged as hubs for the transshipment of
goods  and  duty  evasion  through  circumvention  and  related  strate-
gies.  It  remains  challenging,  however,  to  quantify  the  full  extent  of
duty evasion, and it is likely that additional illicit activity has gone
undetected.  These  tactics  create  risks  for  the  United  States  by  ob-
scuring  an  import’s  source  country  and  factory,  creating  additional
challenges  to  stopping  unsafe  Chinese  products  from  entering  the
U.S. market. Moreover, China is home to the world’s largest counter-
feiting industry, harming not only U.S. businesses but also consum-
ers who face increased safety risks from shoddily made imitations.

Key Findings

 • China aims to continue growing its manufacturing sector, lead-
ing  to  further  industrial  overcapacity  and  a  surge  in  exports.
Chinese  manufacturers  have,  in  general,  improved  in  quality
and reliability over the past decade, owing in part to increased
enforcement by Chinese authorities domestically and increased
due  diligence  by  foreign  firms.  However,  the  scale  and  dyna-
mism  of  China’s  manufacturing  sector  means  regulators  in  the
United  States  struggle  to  respond  to  emergent  product  safety
issues.  New  online  platforms  and  the  multitude  of  third-party
e-commerce sellers and resellers compound these issues.

 • U.S.  regulators  are  overwhelmed  by  the  volume  of  imports  ar-
riving  from  China,  and  they  are  only  able  to  inspect  a  small
fraction of imports, potentially leaving large numbers of unsafe
or illegal goods to enter the U.S. market daily.

 • Unscrupulous  China-based  sellers  lack  the  diligence,  capacity,
and skill required to produce high-quality goods that meet U.S.
safety  regulations,  thus  increasing  U.S.  consumers’  exposure  to
risks stemming from unsafe, counterfeit, and poor-quality goods
from  China.  These  deceptive  tactics  by  Chinese  producers  are
particularly concerning in industries such as batteries and med-
ical  products,  where  defective  products  pose  potentially  debili-
tating or deadly consequences.

 • U.S. import regulators face significant challenges in monitoring
the  growing  volume  of  Chinese  e-commerce  shipments  specifi-
cally,  which  typically  enter  under  a  de  minimis  exemption  that
provides  duty-free  treatment  for  parcels  valued  under  $800.
The  growth  of  smaller,  China-based  sellers  on  U.S.  e-commerce
sites and the rising popularity of Chinese e-commerce platforms
present  a  novel  and  growing  risk  to  U.S.  consumers  and  the
ability to enforce safety regulations and other laws. Insufficient

14

data,  personnel,  and  overwhelming  volume  mean  these  ship-
ments receive less scrutiny.

 • Some  Chinese  companies  have  tried  to  circumvent  normal  U.S.
customs  channels  in  response  to  tariffs  and  other  U.S.  laws.
Though  the  true  scale  of  customs  fraud  is  unknowable,  some
actors  are  using  illegal  tactics  such  as  transshipment,  circum-
vention,  and  import  undervaluation  to  evade  paying  customs
duties.  These  tactics  worsen  the  information  available  to  U.S.
agencies,  increasing  the  challenge  of  identifying  hazardous  im-
ports.

Part III: Competition and Conflict

Chapter 5: China and the Middle East

The Middle East is a region of strategic importance to China due
to  its  energy  resources,  location  astride  key  trade  routes,  and  pos-
sible receptivity to Chinese efforts to construct an alternative, illib-
eral  world  order.  As  China  has  deepened  its  trade  and  investment
interests  in  the  Middle  East  over  the  past  decade,  it  has  also  built
a variety of diplomatic partnerships and sought to present itself as
a  neutral  arbiter  of  regional  disputes  while  expanding  its  military
activity  in  the  region.  In  the  short  run,  China  benefits  from  its  re-
lationships  in  the  Middle  East  focused  on  energy  trade  and  secur-
ing  infrastructure  contracts  for  its  SOEs.  In  the  long  term,  Beijing
aims  to  expand  market  share  for  renewable  energy  and  high-value
exports,  gain  supporters  in  its  bid  for  global  leadership,  and  poten-
tially  establish  new  outposts  capable  of  supporting  its  military  for
increased power projection. China’s involvement in the Middle East
thus  presents  U.S.  policymakers  with  an  array  of  economic,  norma-
tive, and geopolitical challenges.

Chinese engagement with the Middle East is selective and trans-
actional,  focused  on  advancing  its  own  interests;  Beijing  appears
to  have  little  desire  to  play  a  significant  role  in  advancing  region-
al  security  or  to  meaningfully  contribute  to  a  resolution  of  ongoing
disputes, including the recent Israel-Hamas war. Instead, China ap-
pears content for the moment to free-ride on the U.S. and allied re-
gional  security  infrastructure—including  most  recently  the  defense
of maritime shipping from Houthi attacks—while blaming the Unit-
ed  States  for  promoting  instability.  China  also  works  to  undermine
U.S. ties with key Middle Eastern partners while supporting adver-
sarial  countries  like  Iran.  China  takes  advantage  of  Iran’s  interna-
tional isolation by purchasing nearly 90 percent of its exported oil at
a steep discount, generating revenue equivalent to about 90 percent
of Iran’s total government budget. Chinese companies are critical to
the development of Iran’s drone and ballistic missile programs, sup-
plying  dual-use  components  that  are  utilized  in  unmanned  aerial
vehicles used by Russia and the Houthis. Chinese strategists likely
also assess that the turmoil in the Middle East deflects a portion of
U.S. attention and resources away from the Indo-Pacific.

As  the  technology  competition  between  the  United  States  and
China  has  intensified,  the  Middle  East  is  emerging  as  a  key  stake-
holder  and  potential  conduit  for  Chinese  end  users  to  gain  access
to leading-edge technology. Chinese technology companies have had

15

market presence in the region for decades and are working to deploy
telecommunications equipment and other underlying technology in-
frastructure  across  the  region  in  both  wealthy  and  underdeveloped
countries.  Emerging  technologies  like  AI  and  advanced  computing
play a central role in the ambitious national strategies of Gulf Coop-
eration  Council  countries  as  they  seek  to  diversify  their  economies
away  from  reliance  on  fossil  fuel.  Countries  like  Saudi  Arabia,  the
United  Arab  Emirates,  and  Qatar  have  dedicated  massive  invest-
ment to build up domestic technology industry and innovation hubs.
The Middle East will be an important region for U.S.-China technol-
ogy  competition,  both  in  terms  of  partnerships  and  market  access
and  the  effectiveness  of  technology  controls  by  the  United  States,
its allies, and partners.

Key Findings

 • China’s engagement with the Middle East has expanded during
General  Secretary  Xi’s  tenure  and  is  driven  partly  by  deepen-
ing  strategic  rivalry  with  the  United  States.  In  contrast  to  the
Indo-Pacific,  where  China  clearly  seeks  to  displace  the  Unit-
ed  States  and  consolidate  a  position  as  the  dominant  power,
the  Middle  East  is  a  region  Chinese  leaders  view  as  a  source
of  intractable  security  challenges  and  value  primarily  for  its
resources  and  economic  potential.  While  China  does  not  have
the  willingness  and  ability  to  replace  the  United  States  as  a
major  contributor  to  regional  security,  it  is  nonetheless  eager
to  instrumentalize  the  region  in  its  efforts  to  construct  a  new,
illiberal world order at the United States’ expense. China offers
the  region’s  autocratic  governments  a  vision  of  a  new  regional
security architecture under the Global Security Initiative and is
deepening its diplomatic relations with U.S. partners and adver-
saries alike to erode Washington’s influence.

 • Beijing’s  reaction  to  the  Israel-Hamas  war  has  illustrated  both
the  limits  of  its  diplomatic  influence  in  the  Middle  East  and
its willingness to exploit regional tensions for geopolitical gain.
China has played no significant role in the U.S.- and Arab-facil-
itated  negotiations  between  Israel  and  Hamas,  having  lost  its
credibility  as  a  neutral  actor  by  refusing  to  directly  condemn
the  terrorist  group  for  the  October  7th  attacks.  It  has  not  con-
tributed  to  coalition  efforts  to  protect  maritime  shipping  from
Houthi attacks, and in contravention of international maritime
law  and  norms  it  has  declined  to  use  its  naval  ships  deployed
in  the  region  to  respond  to  distress  signals  from  non-Chinese
vessels. Rather, Beijing has sought to appeal to Arab states and
burnish its image as the self-declared leader of what it calls the
“Global  South”  by  portraying  itself  as  an  ardent  supporter  of
Palestinian  national  liberation  and  condemning  Israel  and  the
United States as oppressors.

 • China  is  the  largest  trading  partner  for  many  countries  in  the
region,  with  growth  in  total  trade  and  direct  investment  be-
tween China and the Middle East outpacing that of China with
the rest of the world over the past five years. While China ben-
efits from infrastructure contracts and expanding market share
for its exports to the region, its principle economic objective re-

16

mains  securing  steady  flows  of  energy  resources,  with  between
40 and 50 percent of China’s total imported energy coming from
the region.

 • China  and  Iran  have  a  similar  interest  in  opposing  the  U.S.-
led  rules-based  international  order,  but  the  relationship  is  to
a  large  degree  one  of  convenience.  Just  as  it  is  using  Russia’s
diplomatic isolation to extract favorable terms on energy deals,
China is opportunistically leveraging its consumption market to
purchase  discounted  oil  from  Iran  while  going  to  great  lengths
to  avoid  the  appearance  of  sanctionable  transactions  through
the use of smaller purchases and shell companies.

 • China’s  military  activities  in  the  Middle  East  advance  its  eco-
nomic  interests  while  allowing  the  PLA  to  gain  operational  ex-
perience  and  lay  the  foundation  for  a  more  robust  future  mili-
tary presence.

 • China is emerging as a global competitor in niche sectors of the
Middle  Eastern  arms  market.  China  is  crucial  to  the  develop-
ment  of  the  Iranian  drone  industry. Although  the  U.S.  Depart-
ment  of  the  Treasury  and  the  Department  of  Commerce  have
placed  sanctions  on  a  number  of  Chinese  companies,  Chinese
actors  are  crucial  to  supplying  components  that  enable  Iran  to
build drones, which it sells to Russia and to its Middle Eastern
proxies  such  as  the  Houthis.  China  continues  to  either  directly
or indirectly provide regional actors with technologies that con-
travene  its  voluntary  but  nonbinding  commitment  to  adhere  to
the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR). This includes a
continued occasional and covert role in supplying Iran’s ballistic
missile program by Chinese SOEs and non-state actors.

 • The  Gulf  is  emerging  as  a  new  arena  in  U.S.-China  technology
competition,  with  concerns  that  close  ties  between  sanctioned
Chinese entities and technology firms in the region may be facil-
itating transfer of leading-edge technology subject to U.S. export
controls. Countries and companies in the Gulf may be compelled
to  choose  between  technology  infrastructure  and  partnerships
with  China’s  tech  ecosystem  or  those  with  the  United  States
and  its  allies.  Increased  deployment  of  Chinese-made  surveil-
lance  technology  is  also  a  point  of  concern  given  its  potential
to enhance suppression tactics commonly used by authoritarian
governments.

Chapter  6:  Key  Economic  Strategies  for  Leveling  the  U.S.-

China Playing Field

Many of China’s economic, technological, and military policies are
at the expense of and contrary to U.S. and allied interests. U.S. offi-
cials have long been aware that China’s non-market economic prac-
tices advantaged Chinese companies at the expense of U.S. firms and
workers and resulted in significant shifts in supply chains. However,
for many years, optimism that a complex and interdependent global
economy  would  deter  conflict  and  help  liberalize  China  tempered
the  U.S.  response,  keeping  the  focus  on  more  narrow  industry-spe-
cific  issues  or  better  enforcement  of  existing  trade  rules.  Similarly,
despite periodic concerns that technology transfers might be assist-

17

ing the PLA’s military modernization drive,  until very recently this
was  viewed  as  an  issue  for  narrow  export  controls  on  weapons  and
dual-use  products,  not  a  reason  to  broadly  challenge  China’s  inno-
vation  ecosystem  or  limit  flows  of  U.S.  capital  and  know-how  that
help  build  up  China’s  technological  capabilities.  Today,  China  con-
tinues  to  flood  global  markets  with  exports  in  an  attempt  to  boost
its domestic economic growth while simultaneously pursuing the de-
velopment  of  emerging  technologies  to  assert  its  global  geopolitical
interests  and  spur  military  modernization.  In  response,  the  United
States’ economic approach toward China is evolving to combat Chi-
na’s  state-led,  non-market  practices.  The  United  States’  toolkit  for
addressing these challenges includes trade policy tools, such as tar-
iffs  on  imports  from  China,  controls  on  the  transfer  of  technology,
and  restrictions  on  inbound  and  outbound  investment  that  might
advance China’s development of sensitive technologies.

At the same time, there remains a lack of consensus on the scope
and  implementation  of  these  measures.  Lacking  an  overarching  set
of objectives and a comprehensive strategy for achieving them, some
policies  are  implemented  at  cross-purposes,  weakening  the  United
States’  approach  to  economic  competition  with  China.  For  exam-
ple, while the United States has tightened controls on key dual-use
technologies like semiconductors, it only recently began considering
restrictions on U.S. outbound investment into those same sectors in
China.  Simultaneously,  U.S.  export  controls  have  pushed  Chinese
chip  makers  to  focus  their  additional  efforts  on  legacy  chip  pro-
duction.  However,  legacy  chips  are  also  critical  to  U.S.  commercial
and  military  supply  chains.  Policies  that  allow  China’s  non-market
practices  to  lead  to  dominance  of  the  sector  are  thus  incongruent
with U.S. strategic goals. Unlike the National Security Strategy, the
United States does not yet have a unified strategy organizing its ap-
proach  to  economic  security. The  effectiveness  of  the  United  States’
economic  security  strategy  faces  further  limits  at  present  from  a
lack  of  data  and  analytic  capabilities  as  well  as  a  lack  of  adequate
alignment of policies with key allies and partners.

Key Findings

 • U.S.  trade  policy  is  a  key  tool  for  defending  against  China’s
non-market economic practices, diversifying U.S. supply chains,
and preserving U.S. economic security.

 • Efforts  to  de-risk  supply  chains  are  undermined  by  a  lack  of  a
cohesive  trade  policy  as  well  as  the  continued  presence  of  Chi-
nese value-added content in non-Chinese imports.

 • As  China  increasingly  asserts  itself  as  a  significant  military
power,  export  controls  have  emerged  as  a  central  tool  in  U.S.
efforts  to  deny  China  direct  access  to  critical  dual-use  goods
and  advancements  in  national  security-sensitive  technologies.
However,  a  number  of  operational  challenges  diminish  their
effectiveness,  including  lack  of  coordination  among  key  allies,
compliance challenges, and uneven enforcement.

 • While  Congress  in  2018  strengthened  the  U.S.  inbound  invest-
ment screening mechanism, it considered but did not implement
matching rules on outbound investments. In the last few years,

18

policymakers  have  actively  explored  creating  an  outbound  in-
vestment screening mechanism. Such a mechanism would curb
important  U.S.  economic  support  to  China’s  advanced  technol-
ogy  ambitions,  such  as  the  transfer  of  management  expertise,
know-how, and capital that is unaddressed by the United States’
existing toolkit, including a yet-to-be-implemented executive or-
der.

 • A  lack  of  adequate  detailed  data  on  U.S.  trade  and  investment
flows  poses  an  acute  challenge  to  effective  policy  scoping  and
implementation.

 • Economic  partners  in  the  G7  and  other  developed  markets
have  implemented  trade  measures  to  address  trade  distortions
caused  by  China’s  state-led  economy;  these  measures  continue
to  evolve.  They  are  also  exploring  parallel  export  controls  and
outbound  investment  screening  policies  to  limit  the  flow  of  key
technologies. At  times,  the  United  States  has  had  difficulty  ob-
taining alignment with allies, which can undercut the effective-
ness of U.S. policy and put U.S. companies at a disadvantage.

Chapter  7:  China’s  New  Measures  for  Control,  Mobilization,

and Resilience

After a long period of “peace and development” during which CCP
leaders felt the international environment was conducive to China’s
economic  development,  growing  power,  and  international  influence,
the views of China’s leadership have changed. General Secretary Xi
now believes China has entered a period of increased challenges both
domestically and internationally and has taken a number of steps to
better  prepare  the  Party  and  country  for  this  period  of  threat  and
uncertainty.  On  the  political  front,  Chinese  leaders  have  broadened
conceptions  of  national  security  to  enhance  the  Party-state’s  power,
build  out  the  national  security  state,  and  expand  tools  of  societal
control at the grassroots level. An empowered security apparatus is
warning Chinese citizens to be hypervigilant about interactions with
foreigners. Many of these efforts have echoes of Maoist-era methods
of  mass  mobilization.  On  the  military  front,  China’s  armed  forces
have improved their mechanisms for mobilizing available manpower,
leveraging  resources  in  the  civilian  economy,  and  priming  the  Chi-
nese  public  to  contribute  to  national  defense.  One  such  program  is
the establishment of “new type” militias within enterprises made up
of civilians with skills in high-tech sectors such as robotics, AI, and
unmanned systems. On the economic front, China has implemented
measures to strengthen food and energy security by building stock-
piles  of  key  grains  and  oil  and  redirecting  supply  chains  toward
trusted partners. In addition to pursuing the internationalization of
its currency, the renminbi (RMB), China is also working to promote
an  alternative  payments  infrastructure  as  a  possible  mechanism  to
bypass future U.S. financial sanctions.

China’s numerous and varied actions are driven by multiple goals,
including  the  desire  to  suppress  domestic  challenges,  prepare  for
a  more  volatile  and  less  open  international  economic  environment,
and  position  itself  effectively  for  long-term  strategic  competition
with  the  United  States.  At  the  same  time,  many  of  these  actions
serve  to  increase  China’s  capacity  for  rapid  military  mobilization

19

and  resilience  in  the  case  of  hostilities.  Recent  changes  have  made
China  significantly  more  prepared  for  war  compared  to  five  years
ago  while  potentially  obscuring  the  signals  that  would  normal-
ly  precede  an  imminent  or  near-term  mobilization.  These  changes
have  already  altered  the  strategic  and  operational  environment  in
China’s  favor  by  challenging  outside  observers’  ability  to  monitor
traditional  warnings  and  indicators  and  reducing  timelines  for  the
United States to make decisions in response to China’s actions. Chi-
nese  officials  likely  also  believe  they  have  moderated  the  economic
costs the United States and its allies could impose on them through
sanctions, blockades, and trade restrictions in the event there is an
outbreak  of  hostilities,  potentially  reducing  the  deterrent  effect  of
non-military policy options and external constraints.

Key Findings

 • China’s  leaders  believe  they  have  entered  a  new  historical
phase  characterized  by  greater  internal  and  external  threats.
This  heightened  threat  perception  has  fueled  numerous  poli-
cy  efforts  to  better  prepare  the  Party,  China’s  society,  and  the
military  for  what  the  Party  believes  will  be  a  more  hostile  and
uncertain period.

 • China’s  leaders  have  intensified  their  rhetoric  about  risk  over
the  last  few  years,  increasingly  invoking  a  concept  called  “ex-
treme  scenario  thinking”  that  suggests  Chinese  policymakers
are increasingly thinking through the potential ramifications of
a  wide  range  of  scenarios,  including  the  repercussions  of  ac-
tions they might initiate on the international stage. At the same
time,  CCP  rhetoric  toward  Taiwan  and  the  United  States  has
not  escalated  to  the  degree  that  preceded  China’s  conflicts  in
past  decades  or  to  what  some  experts  expect  to  see  if  China
were imminently preparing for war.

 • China  is  continuing  longstanding  efforts  to  address  concerns
over  food  insecurity.  China  is  largely  self-sufficient  in  four  of
five  key  staples,  though  it  is  becoming  increasingly  dependent
on corn and wheat imports. China relies on imports for the fifth
(soybeans)  and  is  overall  a  significant  net  food  importer.  China
is  believed  to  have  the  world’s  largest  stockpiles  of  its  key  sta-
ples  and  has  taken  measures  to  diversify  its  soybean  supplies
away  from  the  United  States  and  reduce  overall  soybean  con-
sumption.

 • China  is  taking  measures  to  enhance  its  energy  security  and
to ensure it can address its oil energy needs for long periods of
time without imports. China is largely self-sufficient in coal, its
primary  energy  source  for  power  generation,  and  it  has  devel-
oped  a  coal  surge  capacity  to  deal  with  temporary  disruptions.
Perhaps because natural gas is not a major part of China’s en-
ergy mix, China seems less concerned about its significant reli-
ance on imports and only has a short-term stockpile of natural
gas.  China  is  heavily  dependent  on  oil  imports  for  transporta-
tion  and  appears  to  be  building  very  large  stockpiles—with  es-
timates of one to two years’ supply.

20

 • China is taking measures to enhance its financial security, chal-
lenge  global  dollar  dominance,  and  protect  itself  from  U.S.  fi-
nancial sanctions by creating alternatives to dollar-based trade
and the U.S.-controlled financial payments system. These efforts
have  accelerated  since  the  imposition  of  sanctions  in  the  wake
of  Russia’s  war  of  aggression  against  Ukraine. While  the  RMB
is not on pace to supplant the U.S. dollar as a medium of global
exchange, China is developing these tools with the intention to
insulate itself from many types of U.S. financial sanctions.

 • Party  leaders  have  developed  an  exceedingly  broad  conception
of  national  security  and  expanded  their  tools  for  domestic  con-
trol. These  include  an  increasingly  robust  internal  security  ap-
paratus, the revival of some Maoist-era methods of mass mobi-
lization,  and  efforts  to  leverage  the  public  for  surveillance  and
control,  including  by  outsourcing  public  security  tasks  to  gov-
ernment-sanctioned “vigilante groups.” This heightened focus on
security  has  been  formalized  through  an  expansion  of  relevant
legal infrastructure, with new laws defining national security as
touching upon virtually every aspect of society.

 • There  is  currently  no  evidence  that  China  is  preparing  for  an
imminent  war,  but  the  various  reforms  China  has  made  to  its
defense mobilization system over time undeniably make it more
confident and prepared for hostilities than it was five years ago.
Many  of  these  measures  reduce  the  time  needed  for  China  to
mobilize  and  transition  from  peacetime  or  gray  zone  activities
to  active  hostilities  and  could  be  read  as  efforts  to  prepare  the
operational  environment  for  a  conflict  over  Taiwan.  Given  the
decreasing  amount  of  open  source  data  available  about  China,
the  United  States  and  international  observers  will  have  less
visibility  of  warnings  and  indicators  that  may  presage  Chinese
military  action,  a  shorter  timeline  to  react  once  indicators  are
discovered, and fewer non-military tools to respond.

Chapter 8: China’s Evolving Counter-Intervention Capabilities

and the Role of Indo-Pacific Allies

Over the past two decades, China has invested heavily in capabil-
ities  to  counter  military  action  by  the  United  States  and  its  allies
in the event of a conflict in the Indo-Pacific. As a result, U.S. forces
and bases in the region would face a significant threat from the PLA
in  any  regional  contingency  involving  treaty  allies  and/or  security
partners,  and  the  outcome  of  any  such  conflict  is  far  from  certain.
China’s leadership views the U.S. military’s presence, activities, and
alliance  commitments  in  the  Indo-Pacific  region  as  hostile,  leading
the PLA to focus significant efforts on planning and training for the
possibility of U.S. military involvement in a regional conflict.

China’s plan to counter U.S. military intervention requires the ca-
pacity to find U.S. forces, thwart their operations, hamper their abil-
ity  to  rely  on  satellites  and  other  networked  systems,  and  destroy
forward-based  assets  as  well  as  assets  at  long  distances.  Among
the  most  important  capabilities  for  these  missions  are  the  PLA’s
Command,  Control,  Communications,  Computers,  Intelligence,  Sur-
veillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) networks, electronic warfare
(EW)  assets,  and  offensive  missile  forces.  China  has  significantly

21

improved each of these capabilities over the past two decades, with
an increased capability to disrupt or paralyze an adversary’s C4ISR
system and a large arsenal of missiles with ranges capable of posing
a  threat  to  U.S.  forces. At  the  same  time,  however,  the  PLA  contin-
ues to contend with issues sustaining and maintaining its warfight-
ers  in  combat.  China’s  government,  military,  and  academic  sources
also  note  trends  in  U.S.  military  development  with  the  potential  to
undermine  China’s  counter-intervention  capabilities,  such  as  evolu-
tion in U.S. strike and missile defense capabilities, new operational
concepts, and increased cooperation between the United States and
its Indo-Pacific allies.

U.S.  alliances  represent  a  critical  part  of  the  United  States’  ap-
proach to pursuing security and advancing stability in the Indo-Pa-
cific region. Geographic access from these alliances is an important
element  of  U.S.  military  posture  in  the  Indo-Pacific  region,  as  the
majority  of  U.S.  defense  sites  west  of  the  International  Date  Line
are located in host countries. U.S. allies Japan, the Philippines, and
Australia  perceive  China’s  military  buildup  and  aggressive  actions
as a growing threat to their national security and are deepening de-
fense collaboration with the United States. Nevertheless, differences
remain  in  the  specific  activities  each  allied  country  might  be  will-
ing to participate in or to support, driven by differences in political
will  and  the  capabilities  of  their  militaries.  As  the  United  States
continues to enhance its capacity to respond to Chinese aggression,
it  must  navigate  these  potential  differences  in  the  parameters  of
cooperation during a conflict as well as questions about how to best
adapt its force posture, capabilities, and defense industrial base.

Key Findings

 • The PLA plans to counter military action by the United States
and  potentially  U.S.  allies  in  the  event  of  a  regional  conflict.
Since  at  least  the  early  2000s,  China’s  leadership  has  viewed
the  U.S.  military’s  presence  and  alliance  activities  in  the  In-
do-Pacific  as  threatening,  and  it  continues  to  express  concern
about  new  developments  that  combine  deepening  allied  coop-
eration with an expanded U.S. military footprint in the region.

 • China’s  assertion  that  it  will  militarily  defend  its  disputed  ter-
ritorial  and  maritime  claims  threatens  U.S.  allies  and  security
partners in the Indo-Pacific. Should China’s leadership decide to
use force to enforce its claims in the South or East China Seas
or with regard to Taiwan, this aggression could trigger U.S. de-
fense commitments.

 • The PLA continues to improve the quality and quantity of mil-
itary  capabilities  needed  to  counter  U.S.  military  action  in  the
event  of  a  conflict,  including  a  large  arsenal  of  ballistic  and
cruise missiles, air defense systems, advanced fighter jets, mar-
itime forces, and EW capabilities.

 • The PLA has also developed a redundant and resilient architec-
ture  for  C4ISR  to  protect  its  own  systems  from  attack,  and  it
increasingly has the capability to disrupt or paralyze an adver-
sary’s  C4ISR  system.  China’s  advancements  in  counter-C4ISR
capabilities  such  as  directed  energy  weapons  and  anti-satellite

22

technologies  may  threaten  the  United  States’  ability  to  access
its own C4ISR networks for reconnaissance, targeting, and oth-
er functions in peacetime or wartime.

 • Despite  improvements  to  a  broad  suite  of  capabilities,  the  PLA
still  faces  challenges  in  logistics  and  sustainment.  The  PLA’s
maintenance  system  may  struggle  to  quickly  repair  and  resup-
ply  its  advanced  platforms  and  weapons  systems  under  harsh
battlefield conditions, impacting the PLA’s ability to project and
sustain combat power.

 • Chinese  military  experts  perceive  that  U.S.  and  allied  militar-
ies  are  adapting  to  the  PLA’s  improved  capabilities  and  force
posture.  They  observe  that  the  United  States  and  its  allies
are  strengthening  their  missile  defense  capabilities  while  also
working  to  improve  their  ability  to  strike  China’s  forces.  They
also note that new operational concepts emphasizing geograph-
ic  dispersion  and  joint  integration  across  warfighting  domains
could also contribute to U.S. and allied forces’ survivability.
 • U.S.  allies  in  the  Indo-Pacific  are  adjusting  their  defense  pol-
icies  in  response  to  Beijing’s  aggressive  military  posture  and
activities.  Japanese  leaders  are  concerned  about  a  possible  re-
gional  conflict  and  therefore  seek  to  enhance  Japan’s  military
capabilities  and  interoperability  with  the  United  States.  The
current  government  of  the  Philippines  views  cooperation  with
the  United  States  and  other  partners  as  core  elements  of  its
response to China’s military and gray zone threats in the South
China Sea and its own military modernization efforts. Australia
seeks  to  deepen  security  cooperation  with  the  United  States,
its chief defense partner, while reposturing its own military for
the possibility of great power conflict. Nevertheless, allies’ inter-
est  in  working  with  the  United  States  to  address  threats  from
the PLA does not necessarily imply a commitment to allow U.S.
military access to their bases during a conflict or guarantee the
participation of allied military forces.

Part IV: Taiwan and Hong Kong

Chapter 9: Taiwan

China’s actions toward Taiwan in 2024 have been intended to sig-
nal strong discontent with the new administration of Lai Ching-te, a
president whom the CCP regards as a “separatist” challenging Bei-
jing’s stated aspiration to “reunify” Taiwan with the Mainland. Chi-
na  has  sustained  a  high  level  of  military,  diplomatic,  and  economic
pressure  toward  the  ruling  Democratic  Progressive  Party  (DPP)  of
Taiwan, timing actions around events both to undermine DPP lead-
ership and to extend olive branches to opposition figures who signal
support  for  closer  cross-Strait  relations.  China  sought  to  dissuade
Taiwan’s voters from electing Lai by harshly denouncing him while
waging  robust  influence  and  disinformation  campaigns  asserting
that  a  vote  for  Lai  would  lead  to  war.  The  CCP  has  expanded  its
toolkit  of  tactics  for  intimidating  Taiwan,  including  greater  usage
of  the  China  Coast  Guard  (CCG)  around  the  outlying  islands,  new
guidelines  for  punishing  “separatists,”  and  heightened  harassment

23

of Taiwan travelers to the Mainland. Soon after Lai’s inauguration,
China launched large military exercises around the island, similar to
exercises in each of the past two years and designed to suggest that
Beijing’s  planning  for  hostilities  includes  blockade  scenarios.  China
continues  near-daily  incursions  into  Taiwan’s  air  defense  identifi-
cation  zone  (ADIZ)  and  waters. Taiwan  has  enhanced  its  defensive
capacity through U.S. assistance and its own internal reforms, with
an increased focus on military and societal resiliency. Taiwan’s mil-
itary  continues  to  take  notable  steps  to  develop,  manufacture,  and
adopt  asymmetric  systems  and  improve  training  for  conscripts  and
reservists,  but  domestic  factors  and  China’s  near-daily  coercion  re-
main  challenges  to  this  progress.  The  United  States  continues  to
work  through  the  backlog  of  arms  shipments  promised  to  Taiwan,
but a number of big-ticket systems such as F-16 fighter aircraft re-
main plagued by delays.

Despite  China’s  aggressive  posture,  Taiwan’s  vibrant  and  ad-
vanced  economy  has  performed  strongly  this  year,  thanks  to  sub-
stantial global demand for its high-value exports integral to AI and
technology supply chains. China remains Taiwan’s top trading part-
ner,  though  trade  and  investment  continued  to  shift  away  from  the
Mainland  toward  other  partner  countries,  with Taiwan’s  exports  to
the  United  States  in  the  first  half  of  2024  exceeding  its  exports  to
China  for  the  first  time  in  more  than  two  decades.  Internationally,
Taiwan  has  sought  to  deepen  its  engagement  with  like-minded  de-
mocracies. Countries in Europe and the Indo-Pacific have expressed
interest in peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait, even while Chi-
na  continues  its  efforts  to  isolate  the  island  diplomatically.  China
is  also  pressing  countries  across  the  world  to  voice  support  for  its
preferred framing that cross-Strait relations are an internal matter
for  China  and  in  support  of  “reunification.”  U.S.-Taiwan  relations
remain  constructive  and  robust,  with  the  United  States  continuing
to  signal  and  provide  steadfast  support  for  Taiwan  in  a  variety  of
ways,  even  as  China’s  disinformation  efforts  attempt  to  paint  the
United States as an unreliable partner.

Key Findings

 • Lai’s election to the presidency signals broad support for his pol-
icies among Taiwan’s populace; however, the DPP’s losses in Tai-
wan’s legislature may restrain the Lai Administration’s agenda.
Beijing reacted to Taiwan exercising its right to self-governance
with immediate, extreme rhetoric as well as policy adjustments
aimed  at  intimidating  Taiwan.  China  escalated  its  indirect
threats  against  not  only Taiwan’s  leadership  but  also  its  inter-
national  supporters  by  defining “separatism”  in  law  as  a  crime
punishable by death in certain circumstances.

 • China  has  refused  to  communicate  directly  with  the  new  DPP
president  and  has  chosen  to  intensify  its  political  coercion  ef-
forts against Taiwan, suggesting that the frigid relationship be-
tween  the  DPP  Administration  and  the  Mainland  will  persist.
Rather,  the  CCP  has  shown  that  it  would  prefer  to  go  around
the  Lai  Administration  by  interacting  with  opposition  parties
and interfering in Taiwan’s political system.

24

 • China has intensified its military coercion around Taiwan, aim-
ing  to  gain  operational  experience,  degrade  the  Taiwan  mili-
tary’s  readiness,  and  intimidate  the  island’s  population  while
routinizing its increased presence. The PLA launched its second
named military exercise around Taiwan immediately after Lai’s
inauguration in May, as well as a follow-on exercise in October,
and continued to violate the island’s ADIZ on a near-daily basis
with conventional aircraft, drones, and balloons.

 • Beijing  has  also  expanded  its  use  of  so-called  “gray  zone”  tac-
tics—blurring  the  line  between  military  and  non-military  ac-
tions—against Taiwan  in  the  maritime  and  air  domains  under
the  guise  of  law  enforcement  and  administrative  activity  in  an
attempt  to  propagate  its  claim  that  Taiwan  and  the  Taiwan
Strait  are  its  territory. The  CCG’s  robust  role  in  the  May  PLA
exercise was novel and suggested that the CCG could augment
future PLA operations against Taiwan. The reported presence of
CCG ships around Taiwan’s outlying islands outside the context
of a PLA exercise is similarly concerning, laying the groundwork
for  a  more  persistent  presence  and  representing  an  attempt  to
extend  “lawfare”  to  its  gray  zone  activities.  China’s  unilateral
modifications  of  civilian  flight  paths  in  the  Taiwan  Strait  also
abrogated  a  prior  commitment  made  in  2015  to  allay Taiwan’s
security concerns, increasing the risk of an air accident and fur-
thering its efforts to nullify the median line.

 • Taiwan continues to shore up its remaining diplomatic partners
in the face of Chinese pressure to break ties while deepening its
unofficial relationships with major countries in North America,
Europe,  and  Asia.  Using  various  points  of  leverage  and  influ-
ence,  Beijing  has  engaged  in  an  effort  to  get  other  countries
to  endorse  its  false  claim  that  the  1971  UN  General Assembly
Resolution  2758  recognizes  China’s  sovereignty  over Taiwan  as
a matter of international law and to make statements support-
ive of China’s unification goals for Taiwan.

 • Taiwan’s  economy  performed  strongly  in  2024,  with  AI-fueled
demand  for  leading-edge  chips  and  other  high-tech  manufac-
tured  products  bringing  about  a  surge  in  exports  and  a  runup
in  the  domestic  stock  index.  This  growth  came  as  cross-Strait
trade  tensions  heightened  in  the  form  of  China’s  Ministry  of
Finance revoking preferential tariff exemptions on 134 products
Taiwan exports to the Mainland in a move announced less than
two weeks after Lai’s inauguration.

 • Approved  outbound  foreign  direct  investment  (FDI)  from  Tai-
wan  into  the  Mainland  fell  39.8  percent  year-over-year  in  2023
to  its  lowest  level  in  over  20  years.  Meanwhile,  approved  FDI
from Taiwan  into  the  United  States  surged  791  percent  in  the
same  time  period  to  $9.7  billion,  a  record  high.  In  April  2024,
Taiwan  Semiconductor  Manufacturing  Company  announced  it
would expand its planned investment in the United States over
60  percent  to  $65  billion  after  receiving  a  $6.6  billion  federal
grant as part of the CHIPS and Science Act.

Chapter 10: Hong Kong

Under  the  influence  of  China’s  central  government,  Hong  Kong
has  installed  General  Secretary  Xi’s  view  of  “holistic”  national  se-
curity,  weakening  the  city’s  once  vibrant  institutions,  civil  society,
and  business  environment.  Hong  Kong  has  experienced  a  serious
erosion  in  its  autonomy  from  the  Mainland,  although  the  manifes-
tation  of  this  erosion  to  date  has  been  far  more  prominent  in  civil
rights  compared  with  the  business  environment.  Hong  Kong’s  new
national  security  legislation,  often  called  the  Article  23  Ordinance,
introduces  new  and  ambiguous  offenses  that  target  all  remnants
of  resistance  to  Beijing’s  control  over  the  city’s  political,  religious,
and civil society organizations. The continued implementation of the
mainland  National  Security  Law  (NSL)  and  the  imposition  of  the
Article 23 Ordinance, which has already been invoked to make new
arrests,  have  diminished  the  former  distinctiveness  of  Hong  Kong.
The  vaguely  defined  offenses  in  both  national  security  laws  create
an  atmosphere  of  fear  and  uncertainty,  intended  to  coerce  Hong
Kongers  to  self-censor  or  face  legal  repercussions.  Political  partic-
ipation  and  expression  in  Hong  Kong  have  withered  as  convictions
rise  for  activities  considered  by  the  CCP  to  be  seditious,  including
for  singing  Les  Misérables’  “Do  You  Hear  the  People  Sing”  and  for
wearing  a  t-shirt  with  the  slogan  “Liberate  Hong  Kong;  revolution
of our times.” Hong Kong police and CCP operatives are attempting
to  repress  international  discourse  on  the  topic  by  harassing  over-
seas  activists  who  have  fled  and  intimidating  their  families  who
remain  in  Hong  Kong.  Local  and  international  press  organizations
are  self-censoring  or  leaving.  The  seven  million  residents  of  Hong
Kong  continue  to  enjoy  greater  freedoms  than  those  living  on  the
Mainland—including a freely convertible currency and comparative-
ly  uncensored  internet  and  media—but  only  so  far  as  they  refrain
from  violating  the  CCP’s  broad  and  opaque  conceptions  of  political
dissent.

Hong Kong’s status as an international business hub has deterio-
rated, and its economy has lost significant ground since the passage
of  the  NSL  in  2020.  Normal  business  activities,  including  research
and  due  diligence,  collaboration  with  international  colleagues,  and
fact-based  analysis,  face  restrictions  as  Hong  Kong’s  definition  of
national security expands. The changes raise questions about Hong
Kong’s  ability  to  maintain  its  position  as  the  financial  connecter
between mainland China and the world. Hong Kong’s stock markets
hit  symbolic  lows  in  2024,  while  global  trade  increasingly  bypasses
Hong  Kong  for  mainland  Chinese  ports.  Despite  the  relaxation  of
COVID  controls  in  2023,  international  firms  and  expats  continue
their  exodus  from  Hong  Kong.  The  impacts  have  been  pronounced
within  the  legal  sector,  where  notable  international  law  firms  have
downsized their physical presence or left entirely. Meanwhile, main-
land firms and people have moved into Hong Kong for its perceived
comparative  opportunities  as  mainland  China’s  economic  slowdown
worsens.  Hong  Kong’s  pro-Beijing  leadership,  desperate  for  new
sources  of  economic  growth,  welcomes  these  trends.  Beijing  uses
Hong  Kong  to  further  its  military  aims  through  Hong  Kong’s  place
in  the  Greater  Bay Area  economic  zone,  funneling  capital  into  Chi-
nese  technology  startups.  Hong  Kong’s  looser  business  restrictions,

26

which  historically  have  supported  Hong  Kong’s  status  as  a  global
legal  and  business  hub,  now  are  used  by  bad  actors  to  circumvent
sanctions  and  export  controls.  Although  notable  pockets  of  society,
including  the  business  community,  remain  sanguine  about  Hong
Kong’s status as a regional financial and trade hub, that status was
based  on  a  set  of  freedoms  and  the  rule  of  law,  which  Beijing  is
actively eroding.

Key Findings

 • Imposition  of  the  Article  23  Ordinance  further  equips  Hong
Kong’s  government  with  legal  tools  to  oppress  any  vestiges  of
dissent. Hong Kong’s robust civil society, which once set it apart
from the Mainland, is being eroded and replaced with a society
where  individuals,  religious  organizations,  and  the  press  must
censor  themselves  or  face  possible  criminal  prosecution  for  ac-
tivities that were previously protected by law.

 • The  rule  of  law  in  Hong  Kong  is  under  threat.  Hong  Kong’s
courts no longer maintain clear independence from the govern-
ment  and  are  being  weaponized  as  the Article  23  Ordinance  is
enforced. The  court’s  verdict  in  more  than  a  dozen  of  the  Hong
Kong  47  cases  to  convict  pro-democracy  advocates  for  offens-
es  that  allegedly  threatened  national  security,  and  subsequent
resignations  by  international  jurists  in  protest,  illustrate  the
degradation of the city’s judicial integrity.

 • Imposition  of  the  Article  23  Ordinance  introduces  uncertainty
for businesses in Hong Kong. Firms and business professionals
could potentially face criminal conviction for conducting normal
business  activity,  including  research,  international  collabora-
tion, and due diligence.

 • Hong Kong’s repressive new security regime not only threatens
Hong  Kong  residents  but  also  can  endanger  foreign  business
professionals  in  Hong  Kong  and  be  wielded  as  a  cudgel  to  re-
press  the  overseas  activist  community,  including  in  the  United
States, through its extraterritorial application.

 • Chinese nationals and businesses have flooded Hong Kong’s la-
bor  force  and  economy,  advancing  Beijing’s  ambitions  to  inte-
grate Hong Kong along with Macau and nine nearby mainland
Chinese cities into the broader Greater Bay Area economic hub.
 • Hong  Kong  has  become  a  key  transshipment  node  in  a  global
network  that  assists  Russia  and  other  adversaries  in  evading
sanctions  and  circumventing  export  controls.  This  diminishes
the  efficacy  of  U.S.  and  allied  government  efforts  to  advance
important  national  security  interests,  and  it  exposes  Western
investors,  financial  institutions,  and  firms  to  financial  and  rep-
utational risks when they do business in Hong Kong.

27

THE COMMISSION’S 2024 KEY
RECOMMENDATIONS
The  Commission  considers  10  of  its  32  recommendations  to  Con-
gress to be of particular significance. The complete list of recommen-
dations appears at the Report’s conclusion on page 733.
The Commission recommends:

I.  Congress  establish  and  fund  a  Manhattan  Project-like  pro-
gram  dedicated  to  racing  to  and  acquiring  an Artificial  Gen-
eral Intelligence (AGI) capability. AGI is generally defined as
systems that are as good as or better than human capabilities
across  all  cognitive  domains  and  would  usurp  the  sharpest
human  minds  at  every  task.  Among  the  specific  actions  the
Commission recommends for Congress:
 • Provide  broad  multiyear  contracting  authority  to  the  exec-
utive  branch  and  associated  funding  for  leading  artificial
intelligence,  cloud,  and  data  center  companies  and  others
to advance the stated policy at a pace and scale consistent
with the goal of U.S. AGI leadership; and

 • Direct  the  U.S.  secretary  of  defense  to  provide  a  Defense
Priorities  and  Allocations  System  “DX  Rating”  to  items  in
the  artificial  intelligence  ecosystem  to  ensure  this  project
receives national priority.

II.  With  respect  to  imports  sold  through  an  online  marketplace,
Congress eliminate Section 321 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (also
known  as  the  “de  minimis”  exemption),  which  allows  goods
valued  under  $800  to  enter  the  United  States  duty  free  and,
for  all  practical  purposes,  with  less  rigorous  regulatory  in-
spection.  Congress  should  provide  U.S.  Customs  and  Border
Protection adequate resources, including staff and technology,
for implementation, monitoring, and enforcement.

III.  Congress  consider  legislation  to  eliminate  federal  tax  expen-
ditures  for  investments  in  Chinese  companies  on  the  Entity
List maintained by the U.S. Department of Commerce, or iden-
tified as a Chinese military company on either the “Non-Spe-
cially Designated National (SDN) Chinese Military-Industrial
Complex Companies List” maintained by the U.S. Department
of  the  Treasury  or  the  “Chinese  military  companies”  list
maintained  by  the  U.S.  Department  of  Defense.  Among  the
tax  expenditures  that  would  be  eliminated  prospectively  are
the  preferential  capital  gains  tax  rate,  the  capital  loss  car-
ry-forward provisions, and the treatment of carried interest.

IV.  To  enhance  the  effectiveness  of  export  controls,  Congress

should:
 • Improve  the  analytic  and  enforcement  capabilities  of  the
U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Se-
curity  (BIS)  by  providing  resources  necessary  to  hire  more
in-house  experts;  establish  a  Secretary’s  Fellows  Program
to more effectively attract interagency talent; expand part-
nerships with the national labs; increase access to data and
data analysis tools, including the acquisition of proprietary

28

datasets  and  modern  data  analytic  systems;  and  hire  ad-
ditional  agents  and  analysts  for  the  Office  of  Export  En-
forcement.

 • Amend the Export Control Reform Act to require that with-
in  30  days  of  granting  a  license  for  export  to  entities  on
the Entity List, including under the Foreign Direct Product
Rule,  BIS  shall  provide  all  relevant  information  about  the
license  approval  to  the  relevant  congressional  committees,
subject to restrictions on further disclosure under 50 U.S.C.
§ 4820(h)(2)(B)(ii).

 • Direct the president to:

 ○ Designate a senior official to coordinate efforts across the
Administration  to  prioritize  bilateral  and  multilateral
support for U.S. export control initiatives; and

 ○ Establish  a  Joint  Interagency  Task  Force,  reporting  to
and  overseen  by  the  national  security  advisor  and  with
its  own  budget  and  staff,  to  assess  ways  to  achieve  the
goal of limiting China’s access to and development of ad-
vanced technologies that pose a national security risk to
the  United  States.  The  task  force  should  include  desig-
nees  from  the  U.S.  Departments  of  Commerce,  Defense,
State, Treasury, and Energy; the intelligence community;
and  other  relevant  agencies.  It  should  assess  the  effec-
tiveness  of  existing  export  controls;  provide  advice  on
designing new controls and/or using other tools to maxi-
mize their effect while minimizing their negative impact
on  U.S.  and  allied  economies;  and  recommend  new  au-
thorities,  institutions,  or  international  arrangements  in
light  of  the  long-term  importance  of  U.S.-China  technol-
ogy competition.

 ○ Codify  the  “Securing  the  Information  and  Communica-
tions  Technology  and  Services  Supply  Chain”  Executive
Order  to  ensure  that  as  the  authority  is  used  more  ro-
bustly, challenges to its status as an executive order will
not  constrain  BIS’s  implementation  decisions  or  delay
implementation.

V.  Congress consider legislation to:

 • Require  prior  approval  and  ongoing  oversight  of  Chinese
involvement  in  biotechnology  companies  engaged  in  oper-
ations  in  the  United  States,  including  research  or  other
related  transactions.  Such  approval  and  oversight  opera-
tions shall be conducted by the U.S. Department of Health
and  Human  Services  in  consultation  with  other  appropri-
ate  governmental  entities.  In  identifying  the  involvement
of  Chinese  entities  or  interests  in  the  U.S.  biotechnology
sector, Congress should include firms and persons:
 ○ Engaged in genomic research;
 ○ Evaluating  and/or  reporting  on  genetic  data,  including
for  medical  or  therapeutic  purposes  or  ancestral  docu-
mentation;

29

 ○ Participating in pharmaceutical development;
 ○ Involved with U.S. colleges and universities; and
 ○ Involved  with  federal,  state,  or  local  governments  or

agencies and departments.

 • Support  significant  Federal  Government  investments  in
biotechnology in the United States and with U.S. entities at
every level of the technology development cycle and supply
chain,  from  basic  research  through  product  development
and  market  deployment,  including  investments  in  inter-
mediate  services  capacity  and  equipment  manufacturing
capacity.

VI.  To protect U.S. economic and national security interests, Con-
gress consider legislation to restrict or ban the importation of
certain  technologies  and  services  controlled  by  Chinese  enti-
ties, including:
 • Autonomous humanoid robots with advanced capabilities of

(i) dexterity, (ii) locomotion, and (iii) intelligence; and

 • Energy  infrastructure  products  that  involve  remote  servic-
ing,  maintenance,  or  monitoring  capabilities,  such  as  load
balancing and other batteries supporting the electrical grid,
batteries  used  as  backup  systems  for  industrial  facilities
and/or critical infrastructure, and transformers and associ-
ated equipment.

VII.  Congress  direct  the  Administration  to  create  an  Outbound
Investment  Office  within  the  executive  branch  to  oversee  in-
vestments  into  countries  of  concern,  including  China. The  of-
fice should have a dedicated staff and appropriated resources
and be tasked with:
 • Prohibiting  outbound  U.S.  investment  through  a  sec-
tor-based  approach  in  technologies  the  United  States  has
identified as a threat to its national or economic security;
 • Expanding the list of covered sectors with the goal of align-
ing  outbound  investment  restrictions  with  export  controls.
The  office  should  identify  and  refine  the  list  of  covered
technologies  in  coordination  with  appropriate  agencies  as
new innovations emerge; and

 • Developing  a  broader  mandatory  notification  program  for
sectors  where  investment  is  not  prohibited  to  allow  policy-
makers to accumulate visibility needed to identify potential
high-risk investments and other sectors that pose a threat
to  U.S.  national  or  economic  security.  In  addition  to  direct
investments, the notification regime should capture passive
investment flows to help inform debates around the expan-
sion of prohibitions to cover portfolio investment.
VIII.  Congress amend the Consumer Product Safety Act to (1) grant
the  U.S.  Consumer  Product  Safety  Commission  (CPSC)  uni-
lateral  mandatory  recall  authority  over  products  where  the
Chinese seller is unresponsive to requests from the CPSC for
further  information  or  to  initiate  a  voluntary  recall  and  the

30

CPSC  has  evidence  of  a  substantial  product  hazard,  defined
as  either  failing  to  comply  with  any  CPSC  rule,  regulation,
standard, or ban or posing a substantial risk of injury to the
public;  and  (2)  classify  Chinese  e-commerce  platforms  as  dis-
tributors  to  allow  for  enforcement  of  recalls  and  other  safety
standards for products sold on these platforms.

IX.  Congress  repeal  Permanent  Normal Trade  Relations  (PNTR)
for China. The PNTR status allows China to benefit from the
same trade terms as U.S. allies, despite engaging in practices
such as intellectual property theft and market manipulation.
Repealing PNTR could reintroduce annual reviews of China’s
trade practices, giving the United States more leverage to ad-
dress  unfair  trade  behaviors. This  move  would  signal  a  shift
toward a more assertive trade policy aimed at protecting U.S.
industries and workers from economic coercion.

X.  Congress  direct  the  Office  of  the  Director  of  National  Intel-
ligence,  within  180  days,  to  conduct  a  classified  assessment,
and brief its findings to Congress, of the intelligence commu-
nity’s (IC) ability to accurately monitor strategic, nonmilitary
indicators  that  would  signal  that  China  is  preparing  for  im-
minent  conflict  and  the  extent  to  which  China’s  increasing
lack  of  transparency  affects  the  IC’s  ability  to  monitor  this
information. The assessment should include, but not be limit-
ed to, the following:
 • The IC’s ability to monitor:

 ○ China’s  energy  storage  locations  and  stockpiling  rates,

particularly for crude oil, coal, and natural gas;

 ○ Production shifts from civilian to military industries;
 ○ China’s national defense mobilization system; and
 ○ China’s strategic reserves and their compositions and lo-

cations;

 • The  IC’s  ability  to  coordinate  with  non-Title  10  and  -Title
50 federal agencies that have technical expertise in agricul-
ture and trade to monitor China’s food and energy stockpil-
ing and any derived indicators that may signal a potential

THE YEAR IN REVIEW

CHAPTER 1: U.S.-CHINA ECONOMIC AND
TRADE RELATIONS (YEAR IN REVIEW)

Abstract

China’s economy grew in 2024, albeit at a much slower pace than
it did pre-pandemic. Chinese officials have introduced stimulus mea-
sures  throughout  the  year,  including  a  series  of  announcements  in
September  and  October  that  will  likely  provide  a  short-term  boost
to  economic  growth.  While  the  latest  stimulus  round  has  the  po-
tential  to  be  among  the  largest  China  has  passed  to  deal  with  the
current crisis, the measures are insufficient in scale compared to the
scope of China’s economic challenges, and their long-term impact is
questionable.  The  fallout  from  the  property  sector  collapse  contin-
ues to be China’s largest domestic economic headwind and a source
of  weakness  for  local  government  finances  and  consumer  spending.
Officials  are  focused  on  mitigating  systemic  economic  risks  and
achieving  a  controlled  deflation  of  the  property  bubble  rather  than
reversing  the  sector’s  decline. Although  Chinese  policymakers  have
repeatedly  stated  their  intention  to  increase  the  contributions  of
services and consumption to economic growth, in reality, China has
doubled down on a variant of its traditional manufacturing and ex-
port model. China has increased government subsidies and targeted
supply-side  stimulus  toward  favored  industries,  especially  those  in-
volving advanced technology. The Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP)
prioritization of supply-side policies aims to further strengthen Chi-
na’s  manufacturing  base  and  increase  its  self-sufficiency  while  si-
multaneously  increasing  Party-state  control  over  domestic  capital
allocation  and  global  supply  chains  and  increasing  dependency  by
other nations. While this strategy has led to China’s emergence as a
leader in the manufacture and export of goods such as solar panels
and electric vehicles (EVs), China’s export of excess capacity is lead-
ing to increasingly aggressive pushback from China’s major trading
partners and the imposition of tariffs by the United States, the EU,
and  others.  Concerned  about  the  impact  of  rising  Chinese  imports
on  their  own  prospects  for  development,  some  emerging  economies
have launched trade investigations or imposed tariffs to protect do-
mestic industries.

Key Findings

 • Chinese authorities have reasserted and expanded control over
the economy centrally, regionally, and locally. General Secretary

(31)

32

of  the  CCP  Xi  Jinping’s  vision  for  future  economic  growth  in
China  is  politically  driven  and  differs  from  Western  economic
orthodoxy.

 • The  continuing  slowdown  in  economic  expansion  has  led  to
greater reliance on specific growth drivers, allocating capital to
those  targeted  sectors  and  exporting  excess  capacity  to  sustain
growth.

 • China  continues  to  rely  on  manufacturing  and  exports  to  drive
growth  while  also  trying  to  move  up  the  value  chain  to  pro-
duce  and  export  high-technology  goods.  This  growth  strategy
assumes  the  rest  of  the  world  will  continue  to  absorb  China’s
excess  capacity  at  the  expense  of  their  own  domestic  manufac-
turing and technology sectors.

 • China  has  pivoted  from  an  emphasis  on  aggregate  gross  do-
mestic product (GDP) growth to a strategy that targets “higher
quality” production in emerging technologies. China hopes  that
becoming  a  dominant  producer  of  high-tech  goods  will  allow  it
to sidestep systemic economic problems and enhance its overall
global economic position and national power.

 • Substantial risks remain in the property sector, which have al-
ready  had  serious  ramifications  for  the  Chinese  economy.  The
CCP  introduced  new  support  measures  for  the  property  sector
in  2024  and  helped  local  government  financing  vehicles  (LG-
FVs) refinance maturing debt. However, the scale of unfinished
housing and the large amount of local and regional government
debt  far  exceeds  the  amount  of  capital  allocated  for  financial
support.  These  issues  may  weigh  down  economic  performance
in  the  near  future  as  households  await  delivery  of  apartments
for  which  they  have  made  substantial  down  payments  and  de-
veloper bond defaults reverberate through the financial sector.
 • While  Chinese  data  measuring  youth  unemployment  have
shown  recent  improvement,  China’s  college-educated  youth  are
growing  more  pessimistic  about  their  personal  financial  sit-
uation  as  they  continue  to  enter  a  workforce  that  prioritizes
manufacturing jobs they do not want and focuses on skills they
do  not  have.  A  combination  of  slowing  growth  post-pandemic
and targeted policy crackdowns have weakened some consumer
technologies and other service sectors that previously employed
a large majority of youths. To the extent that the CCP’s societal
legitimacy is based on delivering economic growth and opportu-
nity,  the  increase  in  youth  unemployment  has  called  that  into
question.

 • The  CCP  has  directed  state-owned  banks  and  asset  managers
to  intervene  to  prop  up  the  stock  market  and  issue  credit  to
state-owned  enterprises  (SOEs)  and  regional  and  local  govern-
ments on favorable terms. As long as these measures remain a
common  practice,  Chinese  households  will  remain  skeptical  of
passive  long-term  domestic  investment  opportunities  as  a  way
to generate wealth, forcing them to save a larger share of their
income.  Uncertainty  regarding  Chinese  investment  opportuni-
ties dampens China’s attempts to bolster consumption.

Introduction

China  has  renewed  its  strategy  of  relying  on  export-oriented
manufacturing  as  a  primary  driver  of  growth,  expanding  exports
to  encompass  traditional  goods  and  advanced  technologies.  Chi-
nese  officials  believe  new  investments  in  advanced  technology  will
also mitigate potential disruptions brought about by a more hostile
geopolitical  environment  while  simultaneously  revitalizing  China’s
productivity  growth,  which  has  slowed  dramatically  over  the  past
decade. The United States, EU, and other trade partners have taken
steps to address China’s unfair trade practices that they deem to be
market-distorting; however, the CCP has not been willing to manage
the economy consistent with its obligations under the WTO. As long-
standing  trading  partners  take  actions  to  counter  these  challenges,
China  has  deepened  its  close  relationships  with  adversarial  coun-
tries, including Russia. This section examines key developments and
trends in China’s domestic economy and external economic relations,
including U.S.-China bilateral relations and other key relationships.

China’s Domestic Macroeconomic Outlook

As  China  seeks  to  deleverage  and  manage  challenges  posed  by
the  property  sector,  its  leaders  are  faced  with  two  broad  pathways
to  drive  the  country’s  economy:  double  down  on  the  traditional  ex-
port-led economic growth model they have long pursued or shift the
economy structurally toward stronger household consumption as the
new primary driver of economic expansion.1 Over the past year, Chi-
na  has  decisively  shown  that  it  will  continue  its  traditional  growth
path.

China’s  focus  on  manufacturing  stems  from  a  long  tradition  of
economic  planning  that  emphasizes  industrial  production  and  in-
frastructure  development  to  promote  growth,  facilitate  economic
modernization, and ensure Party control over the economy. Chinese
officials  have  built  a  system  predicated  on  low  consumption  and
high  savings  where  capital  can  be  funneled  by  government-con-
trolled  banks  into  investments  in  sectors  prioritized  by  the  Party.2
In  this  model,  household  consumption  is  at  odds  with  Xi’s  goals  of
strengthening the Party and making China the dominant industrial
and  technological  superpower.3  Putting  an  increased  portion  of  the
nation’s wealth in the hands of ordinary citizens could decrease the
Party’s control over economic resources, which is core to its ability to
exert power through its authoritarian hierarchy.* A system based on
investment-led growth reinforces the political status quo by preserv-
ing the Party’s grip on the economy. Overinvestment makes China’s
industrial  base  dependent  on  cheap  financing  to  survive.  Because
this  financing  is  overwhelmingly  managed  by  state  banks,  Chinese
businesses are subservient to Party interests.4

An  increasingly  hostile  geopolitical  environment,  in  which  other
countries  have  implemented  export  controls  and  pursued  de-risk-
ing,  has  also  motivated  China  to  double  down  on  this  approach.5
Through increased investments in manufacturing, Xi hopes to make
the  Chinese  economy  more  self-sufficient  while  simultaneously  in-
creasing  the  control  China  exerts  over  global  supply  chains.6  Top
Chinese  officials  believe  industrial  security  sits  at  the  core  of  Chi-
na’s  stability.7  Though  a  reorientation  toward  consumption  could
revitalize  overall  GDP  growth,  Chinese  leaders  have  long  believed
a slowdown was inevitable.8 Nonetheless, they appear willing to ac-
cept slower growth in exchange for increased Party control.9

Traditional Growth Drivers

Manufacturing

Chinese officials have reemphasized manufacturing as the
central  pillar  of  the  country’s  economic  growth  and  are  at-
tempting  to  supplement  their  dominance  of  commodified
manufactured goods with new, advanced technological prod-
ucts.  China  has  structured  its  economy  to  dominate  global  manu-
facturing.  In  2022,  value-added  manufacturing  contributed  around
27 percent of China’s GDP, the highest percentage among any large
economy.† 10  Given  that  China’s  GDP  is  the  second  largest  in  the
world, this means that by 2022, the most recent year with available
data, China accounted for 30 percent of the world total of value-add-
ed  manufacturing.‡ 11  China’s  share  of  value-added  manufacturing
dwarfs  its  18  percent  share  of  global  GDP;  following  China’s  policy

* For  more  on  how  the  Chinese  Party-state  exercises  control,  see  U.S.-China  Economic  and
Security  Review  Commission,  Chapter  1, “CCP  Decision-Making  and  Xi  Jinping’s  Centralization
of Authority,” in 2022 Annual Report to Congress, November 2022, 25–120.

† Manufacturing  contributed  24  percent  of  South  Korea’s  GDP,  19  percent  of  Germany’s  GDP,
19 percent of Japan’s GDP, and 11 percent of U.S. GDP as of most recent data in either 2022 or
2023. World Bank, “Manufacturing, Value Added (% of GDP) [2022–2023].”

‡ In  2023,  China’s  manufacturing  trade  surplus  was  higher  than  Germany  and  Japan’s  com-
bined surplus during their respective peaks from 1970 to 1980, indicating that China increasingly
dominates global manufacturing output at the expense of its trade partners. Brad W. Setser, Mi-
chael Weilandt,  and Volkmar  Baur, “China’s  Record  Manufacturing  Surplus,”  Council  on  Foreign
Relations, March 10, 2024.

shifts  to  support  new  manufacturers,  this  share  is  likely  trending
higher.12

However,  in  2022,  Chinese  consumers  only  accounted  for  13
percent  of  global  consumption.13  Instead,  China  continues  to  be
heavily  reliant  on  external  demand  and  global  willingness  to  ab-
sorb  its  manufacturing  surplus.  With  Chinese  demand  insuffi-
cient to absorb the country’s excess of cars, appliances, and other
products,  about  45  percent  of  China’s  manufacturing  output  is
being  exported  abroad.14

Chinese policymakers are increasing export-oriented manufactur-
ing,  with  particular  emphasis  now  on  higher-technology  products.
Building  upon  industrial  and  innovation  policies  such  as  Made  in
China  2025,  the  Innovation-Driven  Development  Strategy,  and  the
14th Five-Year Plan, in September 2023 Xi called upon the nation to
develop “new quality productive forces,” allowing for China to “guide
the development of strategic emerging industries and future indus-
tries.” 15  He  echoed  this  message  again  in  December  2023  at  the
annual  Central  Economic  Work  Conference,  which  sets  the  nation-
al  agenda  for  the  country’s  economy  and  its  financial  sector.16  The
slogan  also  featured  prominently  during  the  March  2024  meeting
of the National People’s Congress and in the CCP Central Commit-
tee’s Third Plenum in July 2024.17 In practice, the phrase has been
interpreted  to  mean  a  reemphasis  on  manufacturing,  particularly
in clean energy and other “future industries,” to offset the economic
drag caused by the collapse of the country’s housing bubble.* 18

Chinese  lending  to  the  manufacturing  sector,  which  was  already
experiencing rapid growth following China’s pandemic export boom,
has  matched  this  rhetoric.  From  2020  to  2023,  Chinese  industrial
lending  grew  at  an  average  24.2  percent  year-over-year.19  This  is
more than four times faster than the four years prior to COVID-19,
when it grew an average of 5.2 percent.† 20 In Q1 2024, this amount-
ed to $623 billion in new loans to the sector from the previous year.21
Exports  are  surging  as  well.  From  2019  to  2023,  Chinese  manufac-
turing exports grew 40.5 percent.22 In comparison, global trade grew
by 24.5 percent over that same time period.23 This growth has been
driven in part by what Chinese officials call the “new three sectors”:
solar  panels,  lithium-ion  batteries,  and  EVs.24  From  2019  to  2023,
exports for each have grown 77 percent, 399 percent, and 7,690 per-

* The official list of “future industries” published by China’s Ministry of Industry and Informa-
tion Technology in January 2024 spans several broad fields such as manufacturing, information,
materials,  energy,  space,  and  health  but  also  mentions  specific  items  such  as  humanoid  robots,
nanomanufacturing,  quantum  computing,  nuclear  fusion,  hydrogen  energy,  exploration  of  the
moon  and  Mars,  deep-sea  mining,  and  genetic  technologies.  Xinhua,  “China  Releases  Full  Text

† In  comparison,  over  the  same  time  period,  loan  growth  toward  services  and  real  estate  were
much  more  muted  at  11.8  percent  and  4.4  percent,  respectively.  However,  not  all  this  industrial
lending  is  going  toward  new  productive  capacity.  Researchers  at  Rhodium  Group  reported  that
this credit growth has been inflated by lending to local government-related entities and financial
speculation. They have shown that the share of loans to manufacturing companies in overall new
industrial  credit  declined  to  63  percent  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  2023,  down  from  80  percent  in
early  2020.  Even  though  this  is  a  sign  of  weak  credit  demand  in  the  sector,  lending  is  still  ele-
vated and policymakers are also leaning on other avenues to ensure financing reaches industries
covered  by  the  “new  productive  forces.”  People’s  Bank  of  China,  “China:  Financial  Institutions:

cent,  respectively.* 25  Even  with  these  export  surges,  the  country’s
production capacity and potential future exports are more worrying
for China’s trading partners.26 China now has the capacity to man-
ufacture half of the world’s 80 million new vehicles, and by 2030 its
production  capacity  could  climb  to  three-fourths  of  projected  global
production.27 China has also built enough solar panel factories and
battery production plants to be the sole supplier of global demand.28
There  is  little  expectation  this  will  change.  China  accounted  for  75
percent of global investments in clean technology manufacturing in
2023  and  85  percent  in  2022.29  Bloomberg  Economics  projects  that
high-tech  sectors  will  contribute  22.7  percent  of  China’s  GDP  by
2026, almost double the 11.9 percent they comprised in 2017.† 30

Simultaneously, China is trying to maintain its dominance of more
traditional  manufacturing  industries.  During  the  May  2023  annual
meeting of a top economic policymaking body, General Secretary Xi
laid  out  plans  for  a  “modernized  industrial  system”  while  also  re-
taining and upgrading traditional industries.31 Combined with new
overcapacity fears relating to China’s “new three sectors,” countries
are  increasingly  concerned  that  the  wide  range  of  surging  exports
are  reminiscent  of  the  “China  Shock”  that  happened  in  the  years
following its entry into the WTO.‡ 32 Indeed, China’s traditional ex-
ports  are  surging,  with  Chinese  global  steel  exports  nearing  their
2015 peaks in terms of volume.33

China’s  focus  on  producing  a  wide  spectrum  of  manufactured
goods  impacts  the  global  trading  ecosystem  in  several  ways,  dom-
inating  not  only  at  the  macro  level  but  also  at  the  product  level. A
group of scholars showed that China was the world’s dominant pro-
ducer  (defined  as  producing  more  than  50  percent  of  global  exports
within  a  product  category)  of  six  times  as  many  products  as  the
United States, Japan, or any other country and twice the number of
products  for  the  EU  considered  as  a  whole.§ 34  Chinese  dominance
is  significant  because  it  means  China  is  currently  irreplaceable  for
a large set of goods on international markets. China’s role in supply
chains also creates dependencies that give China alarming leverage
over its buyers, and potentially over foreign governments, and puts
its  competitors  at  a  disadvantage.35  Furthermore,  there  are  hardly
any goods China does not make and export to some extent, even in
sectors  where  it  is  not  the  dominant  producer.¶  While  China  has
long  emphasized  manufacturing  and  exports  as  a  growth  strategy,
China  now  justifies  its  efforts  in  part  as  a  reaction  to  its  ongoing

‡ The term “China Shock” was popularized by a seminal paper published in 2016 by economists
David H. Autor, David Dorn, and Gordon H. Hanson, who argued that a flood of Chinese exports
replaced domestic manufacturers in the United States, creating localized but highly negative im-
pacts on import competing regions across the country. David H. Autor, David Dorn, and Gordon H.

Conundrum,” CEPII, December 2023.

¶ While the previous analysis was done at the six-digit level of the Harmonized System, when
researcher  Andrew  Batson  looked  at  the  four-digit  level,  he  found  zero  exports  from  China  in
fewer than 50 of the possible 1,241 product categories. Andrew Batson, “China Wants Those Low-

trade  conflicts  with  the  West  and  its  fears  over  future  sanctions.36
Former People’s Bank of China (PBOC) official Yu Yongding explains,
saying,  “Re-emphasizing  the  importance  of  comprehensiveness  is  a
reaction  to  the  new  geopolitical  reality . . . .  [China]  should  be  able
to  quickly  launch  or  increase  production  of  critical  goods,  as  need-
ed.” 37  Chinese  officials  hope  broad-based  productive  capacity  will
insulate  the  Chinese  economy  against  disruptions  if  its  companies
are blocked from importing from advanced industrialized countries,
while market dominance will make it irreplaceable in key nodes at
every level in the global supply chain, giving it economic and poten-
tial political leverage.

Heavy state subsidization has been central to China’s con-
trol  of  both  emerging  and  existing  industries.  Conservative
estimates  from  the  Kiel  Institute  suggest  that  in  2019,  Chinese
industrial  subsidies  amounted  to  $242  billion  (renminbi  [RMB]
1.8  trillion).* 38  This  is  at  least  three  to  four  times  and  up  to  nine
times  higher  than  in  the  major  EU  and  Organisation  for  Econom-
ic  Co-operation  and  Development  (OECD)  countries.39  More  recent
data looking at some of the industries championed by China’s “new
productive  forces”  suggest  direct  government  subsidies  for  some  of
the  dominant  Chinese  manufacturers  of  green  technology  products
could be significantly higher.40 These estimates of direct government
subsidies fail to quantify additional support measures such as access
to  subsidized  inputs,  preferential  access  to  critical  raw  materials,
forced technology transfers, the strategic use of public procurement,
lack  of  foreign  competition  in  the  domestic  market,  and  the  prefer-
ential treatment of domestic firms in administrative procedures.41

Overall, in 2023, China’s manufacturing trade surplus with the EU
as  a  share  of  the  EU’s  GDP  increased  by  0.5  percentage  points,  and
its  surplus  with  the  United  States  remained  flat  as  a  share  of  U.S.
GDP.42  Emerging  markets  have  had  to  absorb  the  brunt  of  China’s
surplus. China’s manufacturing trade surplus with ASEAN more than
doubled between 2019 and 2023, rising from 3 percent to 6 percent of
the  region’s  GDP.43  China’s  surplus  with  Mexico  reached  3.8  percent
of Mexico’s GDP in 2023, up from 2.7 percent in 2019.44 (For a discus-
sion of transshipment issues, see Chapter 4, “Unsafe and Unregulated
Chinese Consumer Goods: Challenges in Enforcing Import Regulations
and Laws.”) This has galvanized some governments into action as well.
After Chinese imports took nearly 20 percent of Brazil’s domestic mar-
ket  share  of  steel,  Brazil’s  Ministry  of  Development,  Industry,  Trade,
and  Services  introduced  import  quotas  and  raised  import  taxes  to  25
percent  on  11  rolled  steel  products  to  protect  domestic  producers.45 A
number  of  other  countries  have  followed  suit,  including  India,  Chile,
Mexico, Indonesia, and South Africa.46

Property Sector

Chinese  officials  see  the  need  to  reduce  leverage  and  ex-
cess  investment  in  the  property  sector  but  are  constrained
from  acting  too  aggressively  due  to  the  trillions  of  dollars  in
household  wealth  invested  in  real  estate.  Policy  makers  appear
content  to  allow  the  sector  to  decline  steadily  while  mitigating  sys-

temic financial risk as the sector resets. China’s real estate sector has
been a central pillar of its economy since the late 1990s, with sectoral
growth consistently exceeding the country’s GDP growth.47 Because of
this  growth,  some  estimates  suggest  the  sector  could  account  for  29
percent  of  the  country’s  overall  GDP,  more  than  double  that  of  most
other  countries.* 48  Rapid  growth,  however,  attracted  speculation.  A
lack  of  alternative  savings  options  meant  Chinese  households  began
to  pour  their  massive  savings  into  the  housing  market.49  Real  estate
development  as  a  share  of  all  fixed  asset  investment  climbed  from  18
percent in 1999 to 27 percent in 2021.† 50 Real estate comprises around
70 percent of Chinese household wealth.‡ 51 Just before the bubble de-
flated,  a  considerable  share  of  the  16  billion  square  feet  of  purchased
residential  property  was  speculative  investments  rather  than  real  de-
mand.52  Further,  these  properties  were  often  presold  and  paid  in  full
in advance—no deposits or down payments.53 This generated a broad-
based  affordability  crisis,  with  average  sales  prices  rising  almost  350
percent from 2006 to 2021, causing prices to become considerably high-
er relative to incomes.54

Simultaneously, Chinese developers have long been reliant on debt
to  sustain  their  activities.  The  sector’s  business  model  was  charac-
terized  by  rapid  project  turnover,  quick  sales,  and  high  leverage.55
As  a  result,  the  country’s  developers  had  a  debt-to-asset  ratio  far
higher than their peers in other major real estate markets like the
United  States  or  Japan.56  Recent  economic  downturns  exacerbated
these trends. In response to economic crises in 2008, 2012, and 2015,
Chinese  policymakers  stimulated  the  economy  by  extending  credit
to the non-financial private sector.57 Utilizing this stimulus, the av-
erage debt-to-asset ratio of Chinese real estate developers rose from
around 72 percent in 2008 to more than 80 percent by 2021.§ 58

In August  2020,  the  PBOC  and  the  Ministry  of  Housing  and  Ur-
ban-Rural  Development  directed  representatives  from  the  largest
private  and  state-owned  companies  in  the  sector  to  reduce  their
leverage.59  The  set  of  policies  became  known  as  the  “three  red
lines.” ¶  Chinese  officials  intended  the  policy  to  prevent  developers

* This is a contested value with estimates and the methodologies used to derive them ranging
widely. Economists Kenneth Rogoff of Harvard and Yuanchen Yang of the International Monetary
Fund  (IMF)  estimate  the  sector  to  be  28.7  percent  of  the  economy,  a  widely  cited  figure;  econo-
mists at the Asian Development Bank (ADB) estimate it to be closer to 15.4 percent; and econo-
mists  at  Goldman  Sachs,  an  investment  bank,  estimated  its  value  to  be  23  percent.  Regardless,
the  share  of  the  property  sector  in  China’s  GDP  is  large.  Economist, “Measuring  the  Universe’s
Most Important Sector,” November 26, 2021.

† As  a  share  of  overall  GDP,  investment  in  real  estate  development  climbed  from  about  4  per-
cent  in  1999  to  a  peak  of  14.8  percent  in  2014.  By  2021,  it  had  fallen  to  12.8  percent.  Tianlei
Huang, “Why China’s Housing Policies Have Failed,” Peterson Institute for International Econom-
ics, June 2023, 22.

‡ Estimates  put  the  2012  share  of  housing  in  urban  wealth  at  78.7  percent  and  rural  wealth
at  60.9  percent.  Including  land  and  housing  raised  the  share  to  81.3  percent  of  rural  wealth.
In  comparison,  this  is  more  than  double  the  average  U.S.  household,  which  holds  an  estimated
36  percent  of  total  wealth  in  real  estate.  Briana  Sullivan,  Donald  Hays,  and  Neil  Bennett, “The
Wealth of Households: 2021,” United States Census Bureau, June 2023, 4; Yu Xie and Yongai Jin,
“Household Wealth in China,” Chinese Sociological Review, 47:3 (2015): 203–229.

§ Debt was even more concentrated within China’s largest property developers. The five largest
developers measured by revenue and debt ratio at the end of 2020 were China Evergrande (84.77
percent),  Country  Garden  (87.25  percent), Vanke  (81.28  percent),  Zhongnan  (86.54  percent),  and
Sunac  (83.96  percent). Tianlei  Huang, “Why  China’s  Housing  Policies  Have  Failed,”  Peterson  In-
stitute for International Economics, June 2023, 5.

¶ The “three red lines” criteria to which developers must adhere are (1) a liability-to-asset ratio
less  than  70  percent,  (2)  net  debt  not  exceeding  equity,  and  (3)  enough  cash  on  hand  to  cover
short-term borrowing. Developers who meet all three criteria are allowed to increase their overall
debt by at most 15 percent annually. If a developer breaches one red line, it is allowed to grow its
debt by 10 percent annually. If a developer breaches two red lines, it is allowed to grow its debt

from  incurring  additional  debt  until  they  reduced  their  liabilities
to  more  sustainable  levels.60  In  December  2020,  regulators  further
tightened  lending  rules  and  imposed  caps  on  banks’  exposure  to
property  developer  loans  and  mortgages.* 61  Policymakers  hoped
this would force the deeply indebted sector to deleverage while also
limiting the financial sector’s exposure to the property sector, avoid-
ing  potential  systemic  risks.† 62  Although  regulators  likely  expect-
ed  some  pain  from  these  reforms,  they  miscalibrated  their  impact,
which was amplified by China’s Zero-COVID lockdowns.63

In  2021,  real  estate  developers  across  the  country  began  default-
ing  on  their  debt.64  By  2022,  the  entire  sector  was  in  a  deep  reces-
sion. Across  the  country,  real  estate  investment  and  property  sales
fell  by  9  percent  and  27  percent,  respectively,  compared  to  2021.65
This drop in cash flow caused a 17 percent decrease in housing com-
pletions  and  a  nearly  40  percent  decline  in  housing  starts.66  The
year  2022  was  the  sector’s  worst  since  China’s  nationwide  housing
market was created in 1998.

Falling property values and investment losses have destroyed tril-
lions in household wealth, particularly for the middle class, who were
supposed  to  galvanize  the  shift  to  consumption-led  growth.67  This
demographic has instead scaled back consumption across the board
in  the  absence  of  stronger  policy  support  for  the  property  sector.68
Fallout  from  the  property  sector  also  spilled  over  into  the  banking
sector, impacting trusts and wealth management products that had
concentrated investments in property under the misconception that
housing  values  would  only  rise.69  Many  individual  investors  who
put  their  savings  into  the  funds  have  not  received  their  principal
back, much less the outsized returns they hoped for at inception.70

While the sector has begun to stabilize, it still remains the
largest  drag  on  Chinese  growth.  In  the  first  seven  months  of
2024,  China’s  housing  sales  and  investment  for  new  housing  proj-
ects  fell  by  18.6  percent  and  10.2  percent,  respectively,  compared
with  the  same  period  in  2023.71  China  still  faces  a  surplus  of  un-
finished  homes. At  the  end  of  2023,  Nomura  Securities,  a  Japanese
financial firm, estimated that there were 20 million units of presold
homes  that  still  need  to  be  finished  and  would  require  $440  billion
in funding to complete.‡ 72 Under the guidance of the country’s reg-
ulators,  Chinese  developers  have  devoted  a  greater  portion  of  their
remaining resources to completing presold unfinished projects.

by  5  percent  annually.  If  all  three  red  lines  are  breached,  the  developer  is  not  allowed  to  incur
any  new  debt.  UBS Asset  Management, “China’s Three  Red  Lines:  Opportunities  in  China  Real
Estate,” January 11, 2021.

* The  rule  required  China’s  largest  state-owned  banks  to  reduce  loan  exposure  to  property
developers to 40 percent or less in their total loan balance and mortgage lending to 32.5 percent
or  less.  Smaller  banks  faced  stricter  requirements  and  lower  caps  on  the  allowed  exposures  to
developer loans and mortgages. All lenders that exceeded the caps when they were imposed were
allowed a grace period of up to four years to meet these requirements. Tianlei Huang, “Why Chi-
na’s Housing Policies Have Failed,” Peterson Institute for International Economics, June 2023, 13.
† Real  estate  loans—including  property  developer  loans  and  household  mortgages—as  a  share
of all loan balances in the Chinese banking sector grew from less than 20 percent in 2011 to more
than  27  percent  in  2021.  This  growth  was  often  concentrated  within  specific  banks.  Important-
ly,  the  non-performing  loan  (NPL)  ratio  for  property  developer  loans  across  the  banking  sector
increased  nearly  threefold  from  2013  to  2019  to  around  6  percent. Tianlei  Huang, “Why  China’s
Housing Policies Have Failed,” Peterson Institute for International Economics, June 2023, 5.

‡ Others,  like  Goldman  Sachs,  estimate  the  value  to  be  even  higher,  calculating  that  Chinese
developers need $553 billion to complete housing they presold to buyers and then failed to finish.

In 2024, Chinese officials focused on targeted policies that
support demand and address the supply glut. As early as 2023,
Chinese cities had taken the lead in reducing local barriers to home
purchases,  which  they  continued  to  do  through  2024  in  the  form
of  relaxed  credit  requirements  for  first-time  homebuyers  and  lower
down  payment  requirements.73  In  early  2024,  the  Chinese  govern-
ment  began  designating  a  “whitelist”  of  in-progress  housing  proj-
ects  whose  developers  would  be  allowed  to  apply  for  bank  loans  in
order  to  complete  and  deliver  housing  to  owners.74 The  program  is
available even to developers who have already defaulted on existing
loans.75  In  May  2024,  the  government  announced  a  long-awaited
rescue  package.  Policymakers  at  the  central  level  made  available
$42  billion  (RMB  305  billion)  in  central  bank  funding  to  help  gov-
ernment-backed firms buy excess inventory.76

The  scale,  however,  is  likely  insufficient.77  Goldman  Sachs  es-
timates  it  would  cost  $1.1  trillion  (RMB  7.7  trillion)  to  lower  the
country’s  housing  supply  to  its  2018  levels.* 78  This  amounts  to  25
times  the  size  of  the  rescue  fund.  Chinese  markets  recognized  the
fund’s  inadequate  size,  and  prices  have  continued  to  fall.  Month-

* Goldman’s calculations are based on the assumption that local governments and state compa-

nies can purchase inventory at 50 percent of market prices.

over-month  new  home  prices,  excluding  state-subsidized  housing,
slid  0.58  percent  in  April  2024,  while  the  value  of  existing  homes
dropped  a  further  0.94  percent.* 79  Both  were  the  steepest  declines
in  a  decade.80  As  of  the  first  half  of  2024,  Chinese  housing  prices
have experienced a total decline of 13 percent from their 2021 peak
levels.81

Because  such  a  large  portion  of  household  wealth  is  held  as
real  estate,  adjustments  in  the  property  sector  have  weakened
consumer  sentiment.82  Investment  also  continues  to  fall,  drop-
ping nearly 10 percent year-over-year in April 2024 as businesses,
investors,  and  individual  households  continue  to  view  the  sector
with  skepticism.83

Geographic misallocation of housing has exacerbated Chi-
na’s  housing  crisis.  Unlike  China’s  broader  housing  market,  its
four largest cities—Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen—
face deep undersupply issues, generating a broader affordability cri-
sis.†  From  2002  to  2022,  average  prices  for  these  cities  have  risen
nine-fold.‡ 84 This has implications for the country’s societal makeup
and  labor  market.  The  difficulty  of  purchasing  property  has  con-
tributed  to  a  lower  marriage  rate  because  of  the  social  expectation
that  men  should  own  a  home  before  marriage.85  Lower  marriage
rates are likely to exacerbate China’s looming demographic crisis, as
an  aging  population  saves  for  retirement  instead  of  spending.  High
costs  also  constrain  local  labor  markets,  crowding  out  young  pro-
fessionals  from  China’s  most  innovative  and  economically  dynamic
cities.86 In contrast, China’s real estate overcapacity is concentrated
in  its  smaller  cities  in  the  interior  of  the  country.§  From  2010  to
2021,  those  cities,  referred  to  by  Chinese  statisticians  as  tier  three
cities,  contributed  around  78  percent  of  the  country’s  total  housing
stock, despite only hosting around 66 percent of China’s urban pop-
ulation.87 Those  cities  have  been  hardest  hit  by  the  market  correc-
tion; real estate prices in tier three cities dropped nearly 20 percent
between early 2021 and mid-2022.88

In  2024,  a  number  of  substantial  impediments  to  recov-
ery—including  additional  bankruptcies,  local  government
financial  stress,  and  declining  growth—remain  unresolved.
While  more  than  50  Chinese  developers  have  defaulted  on  their

† Chinese  cites  can  be  classified  by  a  tier  system  that  groups  similar  cities  based  on  their
economic  size,  population,  and  political  administration.  The  National  Bureau  of  Statistics  of
China,  in  its  statistics  on  real  estate  activities,  covers  70  large  and  medium-sized  major  cities
across China and divides them into three tiers. First-tier cities are Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou,
and  Shenzhen.  Second-tier  cities  are Tianjin,  Shijiazhuang, Taiyuan,  Hohhot,  Shenyang,  Dalian,
Changchun,  Harbin,  Nanjing,  Hangzhou,  Ningbo,  Hefei,  Fuzhou,  Xiamen,  Nanchang,  Jinan,
Qingdao,  Zhengzhou, Wuhan,  Changsha,  Nanning,  Haikou,  Chongqing,  Chengdu,  Guiyang,  Kun-
ming,  Xi’an,  Lanzhou,  Xining,  Yinchuan,  and  Urumqi.  Third-tier  cities  are  Tangshan,  Qinhuan-
gdao,  Baotou,  Dandong,  Jinzhou,  Jilin,  Mudanjiang, Wuxi,  Xuzhou, Yangzhou, Wenzhou,  Jinhua,
Bengbu, Anqing,  Quanzhou,  Jiujiang,  Ganzhou, Yantai,  Jining,  Luoyang,  Pingdingshan, Yichang,
Xiangyang,  Yueyang,  Changde,  Shaoguan,  Zhanjiang,  Huizhou,  Guilin,  Beihai,  Sanya,  Luzhou,
Nanchong, Zunyi, and Dali. Affordability is defined using the average home-price-to-income ratio,
which  divides  the  average  home  price  by  the  median  household  income.  In  2024,  major  Chinese
cities’  price-to-income  ratios  were:  Shanghai—47.9;  Beijing—33.7;  Shenzhen—33.7;  and  Guang-
zhou—33. In comparison, major U.S. cities’ price-to-income ratios were: New York—11; San Fran-
cisco—7.1; and Los Angeles—5.2. Numbeo, “Property Prices Index by City 2024.”

debts  since  2021,  many  developers  have  become  nonviable  and  are
only  avoiding  bankruptcy  because  of  policy  interventions  that  have
compelled  their  lenders  to  delay  recognizing  their  bad  loans.89  If
unresolved,  this  could  eventually  spill  over,  further  weakening  real
estate prices and bank balance sheets.

China’s  property  sector  crisis  revealed  a  foundational  instability
within  a  central  pillar  of  China’s  growth  model.90  While  Chinese
leaders  have  tried  to  do  just  enough  to  ensure  it  will  not  become  a
systemic risk for the broader economy, spillovers from the cratering
real  estate  sector  will  constrain  local  government  budgets,  disrupt
the  job  market,  and  dampen  confidence  across  the  economy.91  As
the sector shrinks from its peak of around 29 percent of GDP to an
estimated  16  percent  by  2026,  it  will  continue  to  be  a  substantial
drag on the country’s overall GDP growth.92

The deflation of the property sector bubble has negatively impact-
ed the finances of local governments, which had regularly generated
between  20  percent  and  30  percent  of  their  total  income  from  sell-
ing land usage rights to developers between 2012 and 2023.93 Land
sale proceeds and property- and land-related taxes accounted for 37
percent of total fiscal revenue for all local governments in China in
2021.94 For certain local governments, this reliance has been above
50 percent of total fiscal revenue, meaning the property crisis limits
their  ability  to  raise  revenues.95  Local  government  revenue  gener-
ated  from  land  sales  dropped  23  percent  in  2022  and  an  additional
18 percent in the first 11 months of 2023.* 96 To stabilize local gov-
ernment budgets, transfers from China’s central government rose by
18  percent  in  2022.97  Many  local  governments  have  become  reliant
on  the  central  government  to  stabilize  their  budgets.98  For  this  to
change,  Chinese  officials  will  need  to  find  new  revenue  sources  or
their fiscal obligations will need to be reduced.99

Real  estate  is  also  one  of  the  primary  ways  local  governments
raise  and  service  debt,  typically  through  special-purpose  vehicles
known  as  local  government  financing  vehicles  (LGFVs).100  Rapid
and  lucrative  real  estate  growth  has  meant  that  LGFVs  have  ac-
cumulated  an  estimated  $7.5–8.2  trillion  in  off-balance-sheet  debt
(RMB  55–60  trillion),  equivalent  to  around  45  percent  of  China’s
GDP.101  There  is  little  to  no  evidence  that  Beijing’s  policies  to  ad-
dress  these  debt  issues  will  have  a  long-term  impact.  Falling  land
prices also mean that local governments and LGFVs will face chal-
lenges securing new debt.102

Local Government Fiscal Challenges Simmer

LGFVs  are  taking  advantage  of  refinancing  programs  and
regulatory updates to shift debt around and stabilize balance
sheets  in  ways  that  may  do  more  to  improve  optics  than  to
advance  genuine  structural  reform.  LGFVs  face  a  record  $651
billion  (RMB  4.7  trillion)  in  bond  maturities  in  2024  that  they  will
either  need  to  either  pay  off  or  refinance.† 103  Some  local  govern-

* Land sale revenue and land- and property-related taxes as a share of aggregate local govern-
ment revenue decreased from 37 percent in 2021 to 31 percent in 2022. Tianlei Huang, “Why Chi-
na’s Housing Policies Have Failed,” Peterson Institute for International Economics, June 2023, 32.
† LGFV  bond  repayments  outpaced  new  bond  issuances  from  Q4  2023  through  Q2  2024,  indi-
cating  that  LGFVs  are  making  progress  on  deleveraging.  Through  the  first  half  of  2024,  LGFV
net financing was about negative $27 billion (RMB 197 billion). Bloomberg, “China’s $1.6 Trillion
LGFV Bond Market Shrinks by Most in Years,” July 8, 2024.

43

ments  will  likely  take  advantage  of  $138  billion  (RMB  1  trillion)
government bond fund introduced last year to refinance LGFV debt
into  official  provincial  government  bonds.104  From  the  perspective
of the central government, the program increases transparency into
total debt levels by bringing “off-balance-sheet” LGFV debt onto the
books  of  provincial  governments.  LGFVs  are  also  refinancing  their
own “off-balance-sheet”  debt,  converting  non-traditional  borrowings
into  LGFV  bonds  by  taking  advantage  of  a  new  government  bond
swap  program.* 105  The  newly  issued  bonds  have  reduced  interest
rates  and  longer  maturity  dates,  which  will  help  lower  the  risk  of
defaults  in  the  near  term.† While  bringing  the  debt  back  onto  bal-
ance sheets should help increase transparency and insight into total
debt  burdens,  it  may  also  encourage  moral  hazard  if  investors  see
the  rescue  measures  as  proof  that  the  government  will  not  allow
these  bonds  to  default.106  Longer  debt  maturities  also  extend  fis-
cal problems into the future rather than addressing the underlying
issue  of  an  imbalance  between  central  and  local  tax  receipts  and
expenditure  burdens.107  In  addition  to  refinancing  using  regional
government funds, local governments are also shifting debt burdens
from  weaker  to  stronger  LGFVs,  cutting  expenditures,  lowering  in-
vestment, restructuring private debt, and selling assets to generate
funds  as  LGFV  bonds  come  due.108  In  heavily  indebted  Guizhou,  a
state-owned  firm  provided  a  guarantee  for  new  bonds  issued  by  a
stronger  LGFV  to  repay  the  debt  of  a  weaker,  unrelated  LGFV.109
Together,  these  actions  have  contributed  to  a  compression  in  the
risk  premium  paid  on  LGFV  bonds  compared  with  government
bonds,  signaling  that  bond  traders  have  regained  some  confidence
in  regional  governments  to  prevent  defaults.110  However,  as  under-
lying  weaknesses  in  local  government  finances  remain  unresolved,
this could be merely a reflection of investors’ confidence in the gov-
ernment’s unwillingness to allow LGFV defaults.111

LGFVs  are  also  using  creative  accounting  techniques  to  de-
leverage balance sheets. New accounting regulations promulgated
by  the  Ministry  of  Finance  now  allow  firms  to  monetize  data  as
an  intangible  asset.‡ 112  Since  these  regulations  became  effective
on  January  1,  2024,  some  LGFVs  have  classified  data  collected

* China’s  central  government  maintains  tight  control  over  local  government  debt.  In  highly
indebted  regions,  only  borrowing  used  to  fund  projects  approved  by  the  State  Council  or  for  key
development  areas  like  affordable  housing  is  permitted.  Local  governments  are  also  required  to
maintain balanced budgets, while LGFVs are not, which led to the rapid increase in LGFV debt.

† The  refinanced  bonds  also  come  with  new  restrictions  on  use.  Proceeds  can  only  be  used  to
repay principal on outstanding debt or to fund any of the so-called “three major projects,” which
refer  to  affordable  housing,  urban  village  renovation,  and  dual-use  public  facilities  that  can  be
used  for  everyday  and  emergency  purposes.  They  cannot  be  used  to  make  interest  payments.

‡ Firms  in  the  United  States  also  monetize  the  data  they  collect,  for  example  by  tracking  in-
ternet  browsing  history  and  selling  the  data  to  advertisers.  U.S.  firms  are  able  to  use  this  data
as loan collateral by engaging a third-party expert to perform a valuation on the data. However,
even in an industry worth billions, firms and lenders struggle to arrive at accurate valuations for
their data due to a lack of publicly available information on comparable transactions. In addition,
the developed market for personal data in the United States has sparked widespread data priva-
cy concerns. Brian X. Chen, “The Battle for Digital Privacy Is Reshaping the Internet,” New York

through  business  operations  as  a  balance  sheet  asset,  including
data  on  public  transportation  and  utilities,  with  some  data  al-
ready  serving  as  collateral  for  new  loans.113  Chinese  regulators
have  been  working  on  guidelines  for  how  to  value  and  recognize
data on financial statements, but the value of these datasets and
the  degree  to  which  they  can  be  monetized  are  difficult  to  deter-
mine.114 Although the total amount of debt collateralized by data
is  thus  far  small,  the  use  of  data  of  uncertain  value  as  collateral
shows  how  desperate  LGFVs  are  to  stabilize  balance  sheets  and
take  out  new  debt.115

New  national  security  laws  may  threaten  the  indepen-
dence of international credit agencies—which have identi-
fied  the  rising  debt  problems  in  China—and  make  it  diffi-
cult  to  judge  the  effectiveness  of  ongoing  property  sector
reforms. In December 2023, Moody’s Ratings changed its outlook
of  China’s  A1  credit  rating  from  stable  to  negative,  citing  the
increasing  likelihood  that  the  central  government  would  need  to
provide  financial  support  for  local  and  regional  governments  and
SOEs due in part to ongoing property sector weakness.116 In May
2024, Moody’s reaffirmed its A1 rating with a negative outlook for
China  and  added  that  weak  consumer  and  business  sentiment
continues  to  weigh  on  China’s  economic  outlook.* 117  While  the
ratings  action  is  unlikely  to  impact  China’s  finances  directly,  the
negative  outlook  underscores  the  difficulties  China’s  economy  is
facing  and  may  impact  investor  sentiment.† 118

In  response  to  ratings  actions,  Chinese  state-sponsored  media
argue  that  international  ratings  agencies  misunderstand  China’s
economy and that their models are unsuitable for emerging econ-
omies  in  general.119  By  labeling  the  ratings  actions  as  “a  delib-
erate  attempt  to  undermine  . . .  confidence”  in  China’s  economy,
Chinese  media  highlighted  the  risks  for  corporations  when  their
objective  assessments  contradict  CCP  policy  edicts.120  Prior  to
the  release  of  its  revised  credit  opinion,  Moody’s  reportedly  ad-
vised  China-based  staff  to  work  from  home,  a  possible  precau-
tion  against  a  negative  reaction  from  Beijing,  which  in  the  past
has  included  corporate  raids  and  detaining  local  employees.‡ 121
Under  tighter  national  security  laws  affecting  international  due
diligence  firms,  domestic  investors  may  be  directed  to  rely  more
on  China’s  domestic  ratings  agencies,  which  were  the  subject  of
intense criticism after they failed to identify deficiencies in prop-
erty  developers’  financials.122

* Fitch Ratings also changed its outlook on China’s sovereign credit rating to negative in April
2024 and maintained its A+ rating, while S&P Global Ratings, the third-largest global credit rat-
ings agency, maintained its assigned stable outlook. Reuters, “Fitch Cuts China’s Ratings Outlook

Chinese Consumption Data Are Contentious
Consumption  trends  in  China  are  difficult  to  track  due  to  dis-
crepancies in data. There is reason to suspect that consumption’s
share  of  GDP  outpaces  official  Chinese  statistics.  Some  house-
hold  income  earned  by  wealthy  individuals  and  the  benefits  of
home  ownership  are  likely  underreported,  as  are  transfers  from
the Chinese state to households in the form of education, health-
care, cultural amenities, and food.123 Some have argued that after
properly  including  these  social  transfers,  household  consumption
increased  its  share  of  GDP  by  6  percentage  points  from  2012
to  2019.124  However,  the  growth  rate  of  consumption  has  likely
been  overstated  in  more  recent  years.  In  2022  and  2023,  China’s
National  Bureau  of  Statistics  reported  that  consumption  contri-
butions  to  GDP  growth  were  0.4  percentage  points  and  4.3  per-
centage  points,  respectively.125 Analysis  by  Rhodium  Group  esti-
mates that the reality was closer to -0.5 percentage points and 2.0
percentage  points,  respectively,  based  on  a  variety  of  alternative
data points.126 In 2022, retail sales declined, Zero-COVID policies
prevented  consumers  from  spending  money,  household  deposits
rose,  and  consumer  confidence  fell,  all  factors  that  would  con-
tribute  to  lower  consumption.127  Similarly,  in  2023,  households
paid  down  their  debt  by  13  percent  and  retail  sales  growth  was
weak.128  Data  on  retail  sales,  sometimes  used  as  a  proxy  for  of-
ficial  consumption  data,  present  their  own  problems.  First,  re-
tail  sales  data  include  some  purchases  by  government  agencies,
schools,  and  the  military.129  Second,  consumption  of  services,  a
growing portion of consumer expenditures, is not captured by re-
tail data.130 Third, and perhaps most importantly, Chinese statis-
tical authorities have in recent years retroactively amended retail
sales data, lowering the base of comparison to present rosier an-
nual  growth  numbers.131  Adjustments  made  to  2019  data  were
on  the  scale  of  tens  of  billions  of  dollars.132  Ongoing  revisions  to
retail sales data, albeit on a smaller scale, make tracking China’s
consumption trends difficult.133

China  remains  reliant  on  manufacturing,  exports,  and  the
declining  property  sector  because  household  consumption
has  not  increased  as  a  share  of  China’s  GDP.134  As  China’s
middle class is hit by deteriorating wealth from the property market
downturn  and  China’s  older  generations  save  for  retirement,  there
are few segments of society left that can drive consumption growth.
Key measures of consumption and consumer confidence continue to
indicate  weakness  compared  with  pre-COVID  trends.  Stimulus  ini-
tiatives  announced  in  mid-2023,  including  a  trade-in  program  for
used  cars,  home  renovation  programs  promoting  energy  efficiency,
and lower prices at tourism locations, have been small in scope and
not as effective as hoped.135 In 2019, year-over-year growth in month-
ly retail sales of consumer goods was consistently over 7 percent; so
far in 2024, the highest monthly figure has been 3.7 percent.136 Con-
sumption’s contribution to GDP growth was lower in the first quar-

46

ter  of  2024  than  it  was  in  the  last  three  quarters  of  2023  and—ex-
cluding the period of the COVID-19 pandemic—has remained in the
same range since 2015.137 Chinese consumers continue to spend less
than their U.S. counterparts, driven by a combination of factors, in-
cluding  lower  household  income,  poor  domestic  investment  options,
and a weak social safety net.138 China’s consumer confidence index
has  remained  below  the  100  level  (above  which  China’s  consumers
would  be  considered  more  confident  than  not)  since  April  2022.139
Results  from  the  annual  “618”  shopping  festival  exemplified  weak
consumer  sentiment  as  aggregate  e-commerce  sales  results  from
the event declined year-over-year for the first time.140 Although the
total  number  of  trips  taken  during  China’s  2024  Spring  Festival
holiday  was  higher  compared  with  pre-COVID,  calculations  based
on  official  data  indicate  that  spending  per  individual  trip  fell.141
Reports  of  falling  expenditures  for  services  like  after-school  music
and  sports  activities  demonstrate  how  far  consumer  confidence  has
deteriorated given conventional wisdom that parents were willing to
spend more on their children, even if they chose not to spend money
on themselves.* 142

The  Chinese  government’s  incremental  measures  to  stimulate
consumer  spending  have  failed  to  address  structural  impediments
to  higher  consumption  and  are  overshadowed  by  efforts  to  promote
traditional  drivers  of  growth.  While  Chinese  policymakers  have
identified  consumption  growth  as  a  policy  priority,  stimulus  mea-
sures thus far have been insufficient to overcome structural imped-
iments  that  sustain  China’s  high  savings  rate.† 143  Stimulus  efforts
for  consumer  goods  have  been  limited  and  are  further  constrained
by  the  large  portion  of  household  spending  that  already  goes  to
services  like  education, ‡  particularly  for  lower-income  families.144
Because  a  large  portion  of  family  wealth  is  tied  up  in  real  estate,
stabilizing  the  property  market  will  be  another  key  component  of
restoring consumer confidence.145 China has been battling deflation,
and  the  lack  of  direct  demand-side  stimulus  from  the  government
has  exacerbated  weak  consumer  sentiment.146  Some  analysts  have
argued  that  China’s  government  should  use  fiscal  policy  to  stimu-
late  consumption,  either  through  direct  cash  transfers  or  changes
to  tax  policies  and  subsidies.147  So  far,  the  government  has  resist-
ed  calls  from  economists  and  investors  to  institute  a  cash-trans-

* According  to  Chinese  economist  and  former  deputy  managing  director  of  the  International
Monetary  Fund  Zhu  Min,  China’s  parents  and  grandparents  are  willing  to  spend  more  on  their
children  before  they  attend  university.  However,  once  young  adults  become  responsible  for  their
own costs of living, including marriage and housing, spending drops off naturally, exacerbated by
intense work schedules and a lack of enticing consumer products targeting their demographic. As
a  result,  as  China’s  birth  rate  has  fallen,  overall  spending  has  fallen  as  well.  China’s  birth  rate
has  fallen  from  21  births  per  1,000  people  in  1985  to  just  6.4  births  per  1,000  people  in  2023.

fer-style  stimulus  program.* 148  Furthermore,  because  of  China’s
high  savings  rate,  policymakers  may  be  limited  in  their  ability  to
boost  the  economy  through  fiscal  policy,  as  excess  cash  may  merely
be  deposited  into  bank  accounts  or  used  to  pay  down  outstanding
debt.149  Instead,  government  reforms  have  focused  on  stimulating
supply—and  manufacturing  in  particular.  Signs  from  recent  policy
statements  indicate  that  China  intends  to  rely  on  production  and
exports  as  drivers  of  economic  growth,  with  a  continued  dearth  of
support for consumer spending.† 150 (For more on China’s production
and  export-led  growth  strategy,  see  Chapter  4, “Unsafe  and  Unreg-
ulated  Chinese  Consumer  Goods:  Challenges  in  Enforcing  Import

Youth Unemployment

Successively  larger  classes  of  college  graduates  are  enter-
ing a workforce prioritizing jobs they do not want and focus-
ing on skills they do not have. Worsening employment rates near-
ly two years after the end of China’s Zero-COVID measures suggest
Chinese youth unemployment is not the result of a lagging recovery
but rather a structural mismatch in labor force supply and demand.
Official Chinese statistics indicate that the overall urban unemploy-
ment rate has improved, returning to pre-pandemic levels.151 None-
theless,  Chinese  youth  unemployment ‡  continues  to  worsen. When
China  entered  COVID,  its  young  college  graduates,  a  demographic
group  that  has  increased  in  size  by  nearly  70  percent  since  2012,
were  primarily  employed  in  service  industries,  private  enterprises,
and  the  gig  economy.152 The  share  of  youth  seeking  employment  in
construction  or  manufacturing  was  steadily  decreasing.153  As  Chi-
nese  policymakers  fought  the  pandemic  with  strict  lockdowns,  the
services  sector  and  its  disproportionately  younger  employees  were
most  harmed.154  As  a  result,  while  China’s  overall  unemployment
rate  quickly  returned  to  its  pre-pandemic  average  of  around  5  per-
cent, Chinese youth unemployment nearly doubled from an average
of  10.9  percent  in  the  first  half  of  2019  to  19.6  percent  in  the  first
half  of  2023.§ 155  In  August  2023,  as  China’s  youth  unemployment
rate  continued  to  rise,  officials  in  Beijing  temporarily  stopped  pub-

* Boosting consumption is a key component to the success of Xi’s strategy of “dual circulation,”
which  aims  to  rebalance  China’s  growth  away  from  exports  in  order  to  insulate  the  Chinese
economy  from  external  demand  shocks  and  boost  self-reliance.  It  also  emphasizes  supply  chain
diversification  and  investment  in  the  production  of  higher-value-added  products.  For  more  on
“dual circulation,” see U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, Chapter 1, Section

† In July 2024, the CCP held its twice-a-decade Third Plenum to discuss major milestones and
set  the  direction  of  China’s  economic  policy. The Third  Plenum  confirmed  China  would  continue
to focus on manufacturing and technology as drivers of growth rather than placing more empha-
sis  on  household  consumption.  Rebecca  Feng,  “China’s  Long  Blueprint  for  Economy  Falls  Short

‡ Different countries use different definitions for youth unemployment, but China’s new defini-

tion, revised in January 2024, covers workers aged 16–24 not including students.

§ China’s  unemployment  rate  for  young  university  graduates  is  likely  even  worse.  While  Chi-
na  does  not  release  official  statistics  for  the  unemployment  rate  for  16-  to  24-year-olds  with  a
university  education,  analysts  have  tried  to  estimate  it.  Using  China’s  census  and  its  statistical
yearbooks,  the  Economist  estimated  it  to  be  25.2  percent  in  2020,  which  was  1.8  times  the  un-
employment rate for all young people at the time. Economist, “Why So Many Chinese Graduates

lishing the data series, citing a need to reassess its methodology.156
In January 2024, China resumed publication and announced a 14.9
percent  jobless  rate  for  December  2023.157 The  drop  was  primarily
because officials implemented a new method that excludes students
seeking jobs.* 158 However, even with the new methodology, Chinese
youth  unemployment  remains  elevated.  By  August  2024,  China’s
youth  unemployment  rate  had  increased  by  3.9  percent  since  the
start of the year to 18.81 percent.159

China’s  slow  economic  growth,  tech  and  gig  economy
crackdowns,  and  faltering  private  sector  have  narrowed
opportunities  in  the  areas  where  most  young,  educated  job
hunters  are  seeking  employment.  To  boost  China’s  recovery
from  COVID,  Chinese  officials  relied  on  targeted  stimulus  toward
its property and manufacturing sectors.160 However, such jobs have
traditionally  been  filled  by  (internal)  migrant  workers  and  do  not
match the expectations of new college graduates.161 As a result, de-
spite elevated youth unemployment, Chinese officials are projecting
a  30-million-person  employment  gap  by  2025  for  major  manufac-
turing  industries  like  automobiles.162  In  2023,  total  employment
at  China’s  largest  tech  firms—Baidu, Alibaba,  and Tencent—fell  by
nearly 25,000 jobs or 6.4 percent.163 Chinese limitations on the pri-

vate  education  industry  have  been  even  more  damaging.  Estimates
suggest  China’s  restrictions  may  have  generated  losses  of  three
million  jobs,  or  over  30  percent  of  those  employed  in  the  sector.164
As  China  has  recovered,  private  enterprises  have  also  lagged  far
behind  their  state-owned  counterparts.165  Because  these  firms  are
responsible for around 80 percent of urban employment and 90 per-
cent  of  new  jobs,  the  employment  implications  have  fallen  hardest
on  China’s  youth.* 166  However,  supply,  particularly  of  college-edu-
cated  youth,  continues  to  grow.  China’s  Ministry  of  Education  proj-
ects  that  11.8  million  students  will  graduate  by  the  end  of  2024,  a
2 percent year-over-year increase.167

China’s elevated youth unemployment and pessimism to-
ward  the  labor  market  are  indicative  of  larger  issues  af-
flicting  China’s  labor  force.  Surveys  conducted  by  Martin  K.
Whyte,  professor  of  international  studies  and  sociology  at  Har-
vard  University,  and  Shen  Mingming,  director  of  the  Research
Center of Contemporary China at Peking University, find that the
Chinese populace increasingly views their economic system as ar-
bitrary  and  unequal,  assigning  less  responsibility  to  themselves
and  more  to  the  Chinese  system  for  achieving  success.  Between
2004  and  2014,  those  surveyed  identified  lack  of  ability,  lack  of
effort, and low education as the main factors that explained pov-
erty in China. In 2023, lack of effort and lack of ability plummet-
ed  to  the  fifth  and  sixth  most  prevalent  explanations  and  were
replaced by structural factors like “unequal opportunity” (ranked
sixth  in  2004  and  first  in  2023)  and  “unfair  economic  system”
(ranked eighth in 2004 and third in 2023).168 When asked in 2004
to  react  to  the  statement  “Whether  a  person  becomes  rich  or  re-
mains  poor  is  their  own  responsibility,”  49  percent  of  those  sur-
veyed  agreed;  in  2023,  that  portion  fell  to  27  percent.169

Hard  data  suggest  that,  like  youth  unemployment,  this  senti-
ment  reflects  a  disconnect  between  expectations  and  the  reality
of China’s job market. China’s focus on industrial production has
created  a  labor  force  in  which  educational  attainment  has  out-
paced  an  economy  that  is  still  predominantly  based  on  manufac-
turing.  While  China’s  Ministry  of  Human  Resources  and  Social
Security  estimates  that  almost  half  of  all  manufacturing  roles
will  go  unfilled  by  2025,  Chinese  job  hunters  have  focused  their
efforts  elsewhere.  For  example,  in  2023,  a  record  2.6  million  peo-
ple,  many  with  a  master’s  degree  or  even  a  doctorate,  applied  to
take  the  national  civil  service  exam  to  compete  for  only  37,100
entry-level  positions.170 This  mismatch  cuts  across  China’s  econ-
omy. Zhaopin.com, a major Chinese recruiting site, estimates that
90  percent  of  applications  go  to  sectors  that  provide  less  than  50
percent  of  jobs.171

China’s  elderly  are  facing  their  own  set  of  employment
challenges.  An  inadequate  social  safety  net  means  workers  must
stay  in  the  labor  force  longer.  In  2023,  94  million  workers,  or  12.8
percent  of  China’s  734-million-person  labor  force,  were  older  than

* Estimates  suggest  around  50–60  percent  of  urban  employed  people  aged  16–24  worked
for  private  firms  during  2013–2020,  which  was  around  20  percentage  points  higher  than  prime-
age  workers.  This  proportion  was  significantly  higher  among  vocational  college  graduates,  with
nearly 70 percent employed in the private sector. Shuaizhang Feng et al., “A Closer Look at Caus-
es of Youth Unemployment in the People’s Republic of China,” ADB Briefs, June 2023.

percent in 2020.172 Chinese leadership is magnifying this trend, and
in  September  2024  it  approved  a  plan  to  increase  the  statutory  re-
tirement age for the first time since 1951.* 173

State Directives Weigh on Domestic Financial Markets

China’s non-commercial financial sector has long helped the CCP
achieve  its  economic  and  policy  objectives.  State-owned  banks  pro-
vide  capital  on  advantageous  terms  to  SOEs  and  conduct  foreign
exchange  transactions  to  support  the  value  of  the  RMB,  while
state-affiliated  or  licensed  institutional  investors  under  strong  en-
couragement  from  the  Party-state  prop  up  the  stock  market  via  di-
rect  purchases. The  failure  of  Chinese  domestic  markets  to  provide
appealing investment opportunities for everyday people has contrib-
uted  to  both  the  development  of  unregulated  and  risky  alternative
investments  and  a  high  national  savings  rate. As  economic  growth
has  failed  to  recover  since  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  regulators  and
state-owned  financial  firms  have  taken  steps  to  support  financial
markets,  but  both  domestic  and  international  investors  remain
skeptical.

Banks Reluctantly Support the Property Sector at the Expense

of Private Enterprises

With existing real estate loans constituting a large portion
of  balance  sheet  assets  and  new  directives  extending  credit
to  viable  development  projects,  China’s  banks  are  often  un-
able  to  deploy  capital  into  more  productive  sectors  of  the
economy.  China’s  banking  sector  has  significant  exposure  to  the
real estate sector, with almost 40 percent of loans related to proper-
ty.174 The banking sector’s exposure to the property sector makes it
likely that the percentage of non-performing assets will rise in 2025,
according to forecasts from S&P Global.175 After years of supporting
an  expansionary  bubble  in  real  estate,  Chinese  banks  have  pulled
back  from  lending  to  the  sector  following  a  wave  of  policy  changes
and developer defaults; however, banks remain significantly exposed
to property sector risks.

Banks  have  pulled  back  from  lending  more  broadly  as  well.  Chi-
na’s  aggregate  financing †  shrank  month-over-month  in  April  2024
for the first time since comparable data became available in 2017.176
Multiple factors contributed to the decline, including less overall re-
financing  of  local  and  regional  government  bonds  under  directives
from  the  central  government  to  deleverage  as  well  as  less  activity
in the shadow banking sector.177 Household medium- and long-term
loans, a proxy measure for mortgages, also showed the greatest con-
traction  on  record  as  fewer  new  mortgages  were  taken  out  than
repaid.178  Under  pressure  to  stimulate  economic  growth,  China’s
Ministry of Finance responded by announcing it would issue a total

work,  it  will  be  raised  from  55  to  58  years  old.  For  women  in  blue  collar  work,  it  will  be  raised
from 50 to 55 years old. The changes will come into effect in 2025 and be implemented over a 15-
year  period.  Farah  Master, “China Approves  Plan  to  Raise  Retirement Age  from  January  2025,”

of $138 billion (RMB 1 trillion) in special long-term bonds, with the
first  tranche  sold  in  May  2024.179  Proceeds  from  the  bonds  will  be
used  to  fund  long-term  projects,  including  transforming  excess  ca-
pacity  in  the  property  market  into  public  housing  and  supporting
the development of strategic sectors.180

Chinese  banks  traditionally  have  granted  more  credit  to  SOEs,
which  carry  an  implicit  guarantee  from  the  government,  while  un-
derserving small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).181 The Chi-
nese  banking  sector,  led  by  large  state-owned  banks,  is  non-com-
mercial  in  nature  and  ultimately  backstopped  by  the  government,
making widespread bank failures highly unlikely.182 However, slow-
ing  credit  growth  means  banks  are  lending  less  to  private  sector
borrowers,  despite  the  private  sector  in  recent  years  accounting  for
around  70  percent  of  jobs  and  60  percent  of  GDP.183  Other  recent
regulatory  changes  have  harmed  SMEs’  access  to  bank  credit  by
reducing  access  to  a  popular  short-term  financing  tool  in  an  effort
to support regional bank stability.184

The PBOC has reintroduced a COVID-era program to provide re-
lending facilities to banks that have extended credit to SMEs in the
tech sector.185 This follows past efforts by the central government to
encourage  lending  to  SMEs  through  grant  programs  and  other  in-
centives.186 These programs often fail to spur lending by banks due
to  the  confluence  of  limits  on  the  interest  rates  banks  can  charge
SMEs and implicit state guarantees for SOEs.187

Chinese  policymakers  are  trying  to  mitigate  systemic  risk
in the banking sector with a controlled deflation of the prop-
erty  bubble  by  ensuring  viable  projects  still  have  access  to
bank credit while also instituting reforms to strengthen the
banking  sector.  Chinese  banks  have  been  directed  to  lend  to  a
“whitelist” of in-progress housing projects in attempts to reduce the
stock  of  undelivered  housing.188  At  the  same  time,  recent  regula-
tory  tightening  in  the  banking  sector  will  require  banks  to  recog-
nize  more  assets  as  non-performing  and  set  aside  larger  provisions
for  these  non-performing  assets  as  the  government  continues  its
efforts  to  rehabilitate  the  property  sector.  This  is  in  part  due  to
regulations  effective  by  the  end  of  2025  that  will  require  Chinese
banks  to  recognize  all  exposure  to  a  particular  property  developer
as non-performing once the developer defaults on over 10 percent of
outstanding credit owed to a bank.189 As of January 2024, banks are
also required to internally classify distressed developers as a higher
credit risk.* 190

† China’s  stock  market  fails  to  reflect  macroeconomic  fundamentals.  From  2007  to  2023,  Chi-
na’s  GDP  grew  from  $3.6  trillion  to  $17.8  trillion.  Over  the  same  time  period,  the  Shanghai
Composite, a stock market index of all companies traded on the largest stock exchange in China,

stepped in to halt automated trading and directed state-owned firms
to  buy  shares.  Under  overall  poor  conditions  in  the  stock  market
and ongoing regulatory scrutiny, Chinese companies withdrew plans
for  domestic  initial  public  offerings  (IPOs),  an  ongoing  trend  from
the  prior  year  that  has  accelerated  so  far  in  2024.191  Beijing  has
shown some awareness of the challenges. Beijing replaced the chair
of  the  China  Securities  Regulatory  Commission  (CSRC),  installing
Wu  Qing,  a  seasoned  risk  executive  known  as  the “broker  butcher”
for  ordering  the  closure  of  a  quarter  of  China’s  securities  dealers
during his last tenure as head of the CSRC.192 Market participants
also  suspect  that  units  of  China’s  sovereign  wealth  fund,  pension
funds,  insurers,  and  other  state-backed  asset  management  compa-
nies have been active in purchasing large volumes of exchange-trad-
ed  funds  (ETFs)  in  a  directed  and  collective  attempt  to  boost  the
performance  of  the  stock  market.* 193 At  the  same  time,  regulators
have instituted stricter restrictions on types of trading seen as con-
tributing  to  volatility  and  downward  pressure  on  stock  prices,  in-
cluding short selling and high-frequency trading by domestic hedge
funds and directives to avoid purchases of risky derivatives.194 Some
interventions were direct, with high-frequency trading firms report-
ing instances of their internet access being suspended and borrowed
shares being recalled.195 While these actions were effective in stem-
ming the fall of Chinese stock indices, they indicate that the govern-
ment  intends  to  maintain  tight  control  over  trading  activity  rather
than encourage more market-driven trading.

More  generally,  the  CCP  has  clearly  articulated  its  vision  for  the
country’s financial sector to subdue profit-seeking behavior in favor
of Party ideals. The Central Financial Commission and the Central
Financial  Work  Committee  have  renewed  calls  to  build  a  “socialist
financial  powerhouse”  and  enact  “strict  and  tough  supervision.” 196
State conferences and newspapers have promoted a similar ideolog-
ically  driven  market  that  puts  social  responsibilities  and  serving
the real economy † above the pursuit of pure profits.197 The changes
extend  to  individuals  in  the  industry,  with  employees  of  domestic
financial  firms  impacted  by  salary  cuts  and  bonus  clawbacks  pres-
sured  to  adhere  closely  to  Party  ideology,  such  as  avoiding  extrava-
gant displays of wealth.198

Simultaneously,  Chinese  stock  markets  have  become  in-
creasingly  dominated  by  state-owned  companies.  From  June
2021  to  June  2024,  SOEs’  share  of  aggregate  market  capitalization
of  China’s  top  100  listed  firms  grew  from  31.2  percent  to  54  per-
cent.‡ 199 Over that period, valuations for China’s largest non-public

has remained flat. World Bank, “GDP (Current US$ - China) [2007–2013]”; Yahoo Finance, “SSE
Composite Index [7/1997–8/2024].”

* Similar  buying  behavior  from  what  is  known  as  China’s  “national  team”  could  be  seen  in
past  periods  of  poor  stock  market  performance,  with  large  volumes  of  investments  often  flowing
suddenly into Chinese ETFs. Weilun Soon and Rebecca Feng, “How China Tried to Fix the Stock
Market—and Broke the Quants,” Wall Street Journal, March 13, 2024.

† According to Xi, the real economy includes sectors like manufacturing as well as scientific and

technological innovation.

‡ Analysts  at  the  Peterson  Institute  for  International  Economics  define  SOEs  as  companies  in
which  the  Chinese  state  holds  50  percent  or  more  equity  ownership  and  non-public  enterprises
(NPEs)  as  those  in  which  the  Chinese  state  holds  less  than  10  percent  equity  ownership.  They
also introduce a third category, mixed-ownership enterprises (MOEs), those in which the Chinese
state  holds  an  equity  ownership  stake  between  10  and  50  percent.  Tianlei  Huang  and  Nicolas
Véron, “The Private Sector Advances in China: The Evolving Ownership Structures of the Largest
Companies in the Xi Jinping Era,” Peterson Institute for International Economics, March 2022, 10.

enterprises  have  plummeted,  while  those  of  SOEs  have  risen.  In
June 2021, the market cap of non-public enterprises within China’s
top 100 listed firms was $4.7 trillion.200 By June 2024, it had fallen
by more than half to $2 trillion.201 Conversely, over the same period,
Chinese SOEs’ market cap within China’s top 100 listed firms grew
from $2.7 trillion to $3.2 trillion.202

Against  this  backdrop,  Beijing  continued  to  pursue  a  number  of
financial  market  reforms  in  2024  to  promote  stability  and  investor
confidence  in  capital  markets.  High-quality  development  of  capital
markets has been a key theme at annual conferences and in regula-
tory releases. In April 2024, the State Council released a document
outlining nine directives that would strengthen supervision, prevent
risks,  and  support  the  development  of  China’s  capital  markets.203
The  policies  would  encourage  the  availability  of  a  wider  array  of
investment  products,  including  ETFs,  while  cracking  down  on  mar-
ket manipulation by financial intermediaries and other actions that
violate the law.204

In September 2024, Chinese financial authorities introduced addi-
tional stimulus measures including interest rate cuts, lower reserve
requirements for banks, and support for the property and stock mar-
kets.205  The  market  reacted  positively  to  the  news,  with  a  broad
index for the Chinese stock market rising over three percent in one
day.206  Beyond  this  temporary  surge,  analysts  questioned  whether
the measures would be sufficient to reverse China’s deflationary spi-
ral and achieve the stated 5 percent growth target.207

Ongoing RMB Currency Intervention *
In  recent  years,  China’s  central  bank  has  continued  to  orches-
trate  foreign  exchange  (FX)  market  interventions  that  support
the value of the Chinese RMB amid market pressures that would
otherwise weaken it.† The PBOC has soft-pegged the RMB with-
in  a  set  trading  band  against  the  dollar  since  2005  (notably  the
value of the RMB’s value continues to fluctuate against a basket
of currencies).208

As  the  U.S.  Federal  Reserve  has  kept  interest  rates  higher  to
combat  persistent  U.S.  domestic  inflation,  the  PBOC  has  resist-

* The  Omnibus  Trade  and  Competitiveness  Act  of  1988,  22  U.S.C.  § 5304(b)  requires  periodic
reporting  by  the  U.S.  Department  of  the  Treasury  on  activities  relating  to  a  narrowly  defined
concept  of  currency  manipulation.  From  August  2019  to  January  2020,  the  U.S.  Department  of
the  Treasury  labeled  China  a  currency  manipulator  under  that  statute,  which  requires,  among
other things, that China’s currency manipulation be “for purposes of preventing effective balance
of payments adjustments or gaining unfair competitive advantage in international trade.” While
the  Treasury  has  removed  this  designation,  China  does  still  intervene  persistently  in  currency
markets  to  manage  the  value  of  the  RMB  relative  to  the  U.S.  dollar. Alan  Rappeport, “U.S.  Says
China  Is  No  Longer  a  Currency  Manipulator,”  New  York  Times,  January  13,  2020;  U.S.  Depart-
ment of the Treasury, Treasury Designates China as a Currency Manipulator, August 5, 2019.

† China’s preference for a weaker RMB in the early 21st century was driven by its reliance on
exports  for  growth.  As  China’s  trade  surplus  with  the  United  States  grew,  China  prevented  its
currency from appreciating by intervening in currency markets. This led to vocal pushback from
its  international  trading  partners  whose  own  goods  were  relatively  more  expensive  as  a  result.
Although  China  still  maintains  a  trade  surplus  with  the  United  States,  this  dynamic  has  since
reversed.  China  now  intervenes  to  prevent  the  devaluation  of  the  RMB  in  the  face  of  pressures
including weaker economic growth, volatile financial markets, and high U.S. interest rates. Chris

Ongoing RMB Currency Intervention—Continued

ed  large  cuts  to  its “benchmark”  loan  prime  rate *  to  avoid  exac-
erbating  depreciation  pressure  on  the  RMB.209  Since  July  2023,
Chinese officials have regularly set the daily RMB fixing—or ref-
erence  rate  around  which  the  currency  is  allowed  to  trade—at
a  level  significantly  stronger  than  market  consensus.†  Markets
have  reacted  by  maintaining  exchange  rates  close  to  the  weak
end of the fixed trading band for prolonged periods, and the RMB
has experienced depreciation of around 2 percent against the dol-
lar this year.210 Still, China has favored stability and is reluctant
to  allow  a  rapid  shift  in  the  exchange  rate. Analysts  suggest  the
PBOC  is  concerned  that  currency  weakness  will  exacerbate  neg-
ative  sentiment  among  domestic  and  foreign  investors  and  spur
capital flight.211 Additionally, at the start of 2024, Xi emphasized
“a  strong  currency”  as  one  of  his  top  priorities  to  support  his
plans  to  strengthen  China’s  status  as  a  financial  powerhouse.212
Xi’s speech marked the first time in more than two decades that
a  Chinese  leader  used  this  annual  speech  at  the  Central  Party
School in Beijing to discuss finance, and it has likely encouraged
the PBOC to continue to maintain a strong exchange rate.213

Explicit  steps  by  Chinese  policymakers  to  support  the  RMB
include  verbal  guidance  to  speculators  and  investors  when  they
view  trading  activity  as  a  threat  to  the  lower  bound  of  the  fixed
trading  band,  the  tightening  of  offshore  RMB  liquidity,  and  the
lowering of reserve requirements on foreign currency deposits.214
Despite these efforts, in the first half of 2024, the RMB remained
unusually  stable  close  to  the  weaker  end  of  the  RMB  trading
band.  Historically,  this  has  meant  the  PBOC  is  maintaining  the
band through the sale of FX.215 However, the PBOC’s foreign cur-
rency balance sheet has moved slightly in the opposite direction,
suggesting the bank has not used its own funds to keep the RMB
inside  the  weak  edge  of  the  band.216  This  contradiction  has  led
some  analysts  to  suggest  the  PBOC  has  instead  turned  to  state-
owned  banks  to  actively  manage  FX  markets  and  support  the
RMB against further depreciation.217

U.S.-China Bilateral Commercial Relations
Bilateral Trade Slows

Total  U.S.-China  trade  continued  to  be  stagnant  through
the  first  eight  months  of  2024  amidst  weakening  economic
conditions, price effects, increased geopolitical tensions, and
a  rising  trend  of  supply  chain  diversification.  Although  U.S.
official  trade  statistics  capture  only  a  portion  of  trade  with  China,
the  data  indicate  a  downward  shift  in  the  direct  flow  of  goods  (see

* After the U.S. Federal Reserve cut interest rates by 0.5 percentage points in September 2024,

sures,” Washington Post, September 24, 2024.

Figure  4).  U.S.  imports  and  exports  of  goods  with  China  reached
just  $575  billion  in  2023,  a  decrease  of  16.8  percent  from  the  year
earlier.* 218 While the slowdown continued early in 2024, by August
total U.S.-China trade for the year to date was virtually unchanged
from  the  same  period  in  2023.219  Weakening  Chinese  demand  for
most  U.S.  exports  and  stagnant  U.S.  imports  caused  the  U.S.-China
trade deficit to increase slightly.220 In the first eight months of 2024,
the bilateral trade deficit rose to $186 billion, a 2.4 percent increase
over the same period in 2023.221

The U.S. trade statistics substantially understate the trade deficit
with China as tens of billions of dollars of small parcel imports that
enter  duty  free  under  the  de  minimis  exemption  are  not  incorpo-
rated  in  official  U.S.  trade  estimates.† 222  Trade  statistics  prepared
by China’s customs agency, which capture all exports to the United
States  including  de  minimis  shipments,  suggest  the  scale  of  mis-
measurement in U.S. customs figures. China reported that it export-
ed  $506  billion  in  goods  to  the  United  States  in  2023,  $79  billion
more  than  the  United  States  recorded  as  imports.223  (For  more  on
distortions  to  U.S.  trade  data  caused  by  tariff  avoidance  strategies
including de minimis entry, see Chapter 4, “Unsafe and Unregulated
Chinese  Consumer  Goods:  Challenges  in  Enforcing  Import  Regula-
tions and Laws.”)

Imports

Following a sharp decline in 2023, U.S. goods imports from
China  leveled  off  in  the  first  eight  months  of  2024. According
to  U.S.  data,  in  2023,  the  United  States  imported  $427  billion  in
goods  from  China,  down  by  over  20  percent  from  2022  and  falling

* Trade data produced by China’s customs agency, which better account for cross-border e-com-
merce  trade  than  U.S.  data,  also  point  toward  a  fall  in  the  goods  trade.  In  Chinese  data,  goods
exports and imports with the  United  States fell  to  $672 billion in 2023, down 11.5 percent from
the year prior. China’s General Administration of Customs, Customs Statistics, July 2024.

to the second-lowest import level since 2012, surpassed only by the
pandemic-induced slowdown in trade in 2020.224 Eight months into
2024, U.S. imports from China amounted to $279 billion, increasing
by  1.3  percent  from  2023.225  Softening  U.S.  consumer  confidence  in
the  first  half  of  2024  dragged  on  imports  as  growth  in  household
spending  slowed  in  response  to  concerns  about  inflation  and  poor
consumer  sentiment.226  U.S.  tariffs  and  bilateral  tensions  have
also  prompted  some  importers  to  reduce  their  dependence  on  Chi-
nese imports and shift to alternative sourcing hubs, contributing to
the  continued  weakness  in  direct  imports  from  China  (see  “Supply
Chain  Diversification  from  China  Is  Occurring,  but  the  Extent  Re-
mains Unclear” in this section).

In  addition,  price  and  exchange  rate  effects  contributed  to  the
decline  in  import  value  and  relieved  some  pressure  on  U.S.  infla-
tion.227 The  price  of  imports  from  China  fell  1.4  percent  in August
2024  from  a  year  earlier.* 228 This  deflation  in  price  largely  reflects
overproduction  in  China,  with  producers  looking  to  shift  a  greater
share  of  sales  overseas  amid  weak  domestic  demand.229  The  price
of fabricated metal products, the United States’ fifth-largest import
category  with  China,  fell  2.1  percent  in  August  2024  from  a  year
earlier.230 RMB depreciation further depressed the value of imports
from China, as a weaker RMB means Chinese goods are cheaper in
dollar-equivalent  terms.231  Nonetheless,  the  volume  of  U.S.  imports
could  strengthen  into  2025  as  consumers  and  businesses  take  ad-
vantage of reduced prices from China.†

Exports

Overall U.S. exports to China continued to slow in 2024 due
in  part  to  persistently  weak  Chinese  consumption.  Though
U.S.  exports  of  goods  in  2023  remained  elevated  above  pre-COVID
levels,  at  $148  billion,  the  export  volume  shrunk  4.1  percent  from
2022  levels  as  China’s  economy  remained  stagnant  after  ending
its  Zero-COVID  policies.232  In  the  year  through  August  2024,  the
flow  of  goods  continued  to  fall,  reflecting  the  ongoing  sluggishness
in  China’s  domestic  demand.233 The  United  States  sent  $93  billion
in  goods  to  China  in  the  first  eight  months  of  2024,  down  0.8  per-
cent from the previous year.234 U.S. exports were boosted by sales of
advanced  technology  products,‡  which  grew  33  percent  in  the  year
through  August  2024,  largely  due  to  a  resurgence  in  shipments  of
U.S. semiconductors and airplane parts, as discussed below.235 How-
ever,  export  growth  was  weighed  down  in  other  sectors,  including
agriculture,  amid  Chinese  polices  aimed  at  diversifying  away  from
U.S. products, notably soybeans.236

* Accounting for price effects, the real value of U.S. imports from China increased by 3.4 percent
in the year through August 2024 compared to a year earlier. U.S. Census Bureau, Trade in Goods

† Data on container freight volume suggest this is already taking place. Between January and
August 2024, containerized imports to U.S. seaports rose by 15.1 percent year-on-year in weight,
despite the more modest 1.3 percent increase in value. This likely reflects an increase in low-val-
ue,  high-weight  products.  For  instance,  China’s  exports  of  plastic  products  have  surged  in  2024.

U.S. Shipments of Semiconductors Rebound

U.S. exports to China of non-export-controlled semiconduc-
tors  expanded  at  the  start  of  2024.  To  curb  China’s  advance-
ments  in  critical  technology,  the  U.S.  Department  of  Commerce  im-
plemented controls on U.S. exports of the most advanced computing
chips  and  advanced  semiconductor  manufacturing  equipment  to
China  in  October  2022  and  expanded  them  in  October  2023.  The
controls  did  not  apply  to  “legacy  semiconductors”  or  less  advanced
chips  used  in  home  appliances,  automobiles,  and  many  connected
devices. Though exports of semiconductors fell 45.5 percent in 2023,
in 2024 the flow of U.S. chips rose sharply.237 Between January and
August 2024, U.S. semiconductor companies exported $5.3 billion in
chips  to  China,  an  increase  of  69  percent  from  the  same  period  in
2023 but still down from 2022 levels.238 To comply with U.S. export
restrictions,  U.S.  chip  companies  such  as  Intel  and  NVIDIA  have
developed  AI  chips  for  the  China  market  that  have  lower  perfor-
mance  capabilities.239 Though  these  chips  underperform  relative  to
the  leading-edge  AI  chips  sold  to  other  customers,  some  Chinese
companies  have  turned  to  these  tuned-down  processors  given  the
country’s  shortage  of  computing  power.240  The  growth  in  U.S.  chip
exports at the start of 2024 likely also reflected an uptick in sales of
processors  to  Chinese  consumer  electronics  manufacturers,  though
this  growth  may  have  since  slowed  as  U.S.  authorities  further  re-
stricted  sales  to  Huawei.  In  May  2024,  the  Commerce  Department
revoked export licenses for Intel and Qualcomm that reportedly per-
mitted  them  to  sell  smartphone  and  laptop  chips  to  Huawei.* 241

China’s Aviation Sector Surges Demand for U.S. Components

A  post-Zero-COVID  rebound  in  Chinese  domestic  air  trav-
el boosted demand for U.S. planes and aviation components.
U.S. exports of civilian aircraft, engines, equipment, and parts grew
65  percent  in  the  first  eight  months  of  2024  relative  to  the  same
period  in  2023,  reaching  $7.7  billion.242  Exports  of  these  products
reached their highest volume since the onset of the COVID-19 pan-
demic  as  air  travel  began  to  revive  in  China  and  are  on  track  to
exceed  2019  levels.243  By  August  2024,  total  air  passenger  traffic
rose to 492 million trips, increasing 20 percent over the same period
in  2023  and  exceeding  the  pre-pandemic  levels  of  2019,  according
to  data  from  the  Civil  Aviation  Administration  of  (CAAC).† 244 The
increased traffic led to higher demand for parts to maintain China’s
air  fleet,  boosting  U.S.  exports.245  In  addition,  China’s  state-owned
aerospace  company  Commercial Aircraft  Corporation  of  China,  Ltd.

aerospace companies (see textbox).246

China’s Aviation Industry Remains Dependent on
Foreign Suppliers

Despite  China’s  efforts  to  become  self-sufficient  in  aviation,
it  remains  reliant  on  U.S.  and  European  aerospace  components.
China  has  aimed  to  develop  a  domestic  civil  aviation  industry
since  the  1970s.247  More  recently,  in  2014,  Xi  called  on  COMAC
to  “independently  develop  and  manufacture  large  passenger  air-
craft as soon as possible,” and the Chinese government has since
issued  many  policy  documents  like  the  CCP  Central  Committee
and  State  Council’s  Outline  for  Building  a  Powerful  Transporta-
tion Country that called for “raising the technological level of do-
mestically produced aircraft and engines.” 248 Despite these goals
(and attempts to access foreign technology through joint ventures
and  cyberespionage),  China  has  only  produced  two  commercial
jet  models,  and  its  aviation  industry  remains  reliant  on  foreign
suppliers.249 For example, the engine used in the C919, COMAC’s
first “home-grown” narrow-body jet, is produced by a joint venture
between  U.S.  GE  Aviation  and  French  Safran.250  In  2016,  CO-
MAC,  Chinese  defense  contractor  Aviation  Industry  Corporation
of  China  (AVIC),  and  the  Beijing  municipal  government  formed
the  Aero  Engine  Corporation  of  China  (AECC)  to  domestically
produce  an  engine  for  the  C919,  but  that  engine  has  yet  to  be
approved by the CAAC.251 Even if AECC’s engine is approved, it
will rely on components sourced from companies in Germany and
the United Kingdom.252 There are no plans to develop a domestic
alternative to the GE engine used in COMAC’s other commercial
model, the ARJ21 regional jet.253 A 2020 Center for Strategic and
International  Studies  report  found  that  in  addition  to  engines,
the  C919  is  reliant  on  U.S.  and  European  companies  for  over  75
percent of its key components, with more recent research indicat-
ing  components  ranging  from  communications  and  flight  control
systems  to  tires  continue  to  be  imported.254  China’s  exposure  to
U.S. and allied suppliers was clear when COMAC ran out of some
parts and struggled to meet production targets after being placed
on  the  U.S.  Department  of  Defense’s  (DOD)  Communist  Chinese
Military Companies list in 2021 (sanctions against COMAC were
dropped  ten  months  later  when  it  was  not  included  on  the  Non-
SDN  Chinese  Military-Industrial  Complex  Companies  List  that
replaced  this  DOD  list);  it  was  also  evident  when,  in  the  same
year, Canadian and U.S. denial of export licenses for the Pratt &
Whitney PW150 engine led to the effective cancelation of China’s
MA700 aircraft program.255

China  resumed  importing  Boeing  aircraft  after  a  three-year
freeze, but the aerospace company continues to face scrutiny selling
into the Chinese market. China suspended most orders and deliver-
ies  of  Boeing  aircraft  in  2019  following  two  fatal  crashes  involving
Boeing’s  737  MAX  8,  keeping  the  pause  in  place  through  most  of

59

2023  even  as  other  civil  aviation  bodies  recertified  the  airframe.  In
December 2023, Chinese regulators approved Boeing’s first delivery
of  a  787  Dreamliner  since  2019,  though  shipments  were  disrupt-
ed shortly thereafter.256 Chinese regulators again paused approvals
between  May  and  July  2024,  ostensibly  for  a  regulatory  inspection
of  a  component,  before  permitting  further  deliveries.257  The  pause
coincided with Chinese sanctions issued on May 19, 2024—after the
inauguration  of  Taiwan’s  President  Lai  Ching-te—against  Boeing’s
defense unit along with two other U.S. defense firms over arms sales
to  Taiwan.* 258  Though  the  sanctions  placed  no  direct  restrictions
on  Boeing’s  civil  aviation  unit,  China’s  coercion  points  toward  its
willingness to leverage its commercial relationship with the United
States as it pursues its geopolitical objectives.

China Continues to Reduce Purchases of U.S. Agriculture Goods

U.S.  exports  of  agriculture  products  to  China  fell  in  2024
as China switched to lower-cost, non-U.S. sources. Though ag-
ricultural products continue to be one of the United States’ leading
exports  to  China,  U.S.  agriculture  exports  fell  15  percent  by  value
year-on-year  in  the  year  through  August  2024,  totaling  $13.7  bil-
lion.259 This  decline  in  value  partially  reflects  falling  food  prices  in
global commodity markets due to large harvests and weaker demand;
the volume of U.S. exports to China dropped at the slower rate of 5
percent by weight.260 The drop also reflects China’s ongoing shift to-
ward alternative suppliers, driven by a desire to reduce dependence
on  the  United  States  and  strengthen  its  food  security.  Since  2018,
when  China  responded  to  U.S.  tariffs  on  Chinese  goods  with  retal-
iatory  duties  on  many  agriculture  products  and  other  goods,  U.S.
producers have lost ground in China’s import market.261 The United
States’  share  of  China’s  agriculture  imports  by  value  fell  from  19
percent in 2017 to 13 percent in 2023.262 Much of the U.S. share was
taken over by Brazil.263 Brazil is now China’s top overseas supplier
for  vital  crops,  including  soybeans,  which  are  used  as  animal  feed
or  converted  into  edible  oils.264  In  the  year  through  August  2024,
Brazil supplied 74 percent of China’s soybean imports, exporting 3.6
times more than the United States.265 Nonetheless, the Party-state
continues  to  view  China’s  dependence  on  imported  soybeans  as  a
significant challenge for ensuring China’s food security. (For more on
Beijing’s prioritization of food security, see Chapter 7, “China’s New
Measures for Control, Mobilization, and Resilience.”)

China  Uses  Its  Leverage  over  Critical  Minerals  to  Retaliate

against U.S. Economic Statecraft

China  is  using  its  dominance  over  key  minerals  to  selec-
tively  ramp  up  pressure  on  supply  chains  critical  to  U.S.
national  security.  On  July  3,  2023,  China  announced  new  export
controls  on  germanium  and  gallium  in  response  to  U.S.  technology
export controls.266 It further restricted the export of rare earth pro-
cessing technologies in December 2023.267 Nearly half of the world’s
rare earths resources are mined outside of China, but China current-

ly  performs  almost  90  percent  of  processing  across  all  rare  earths,
including  60  percent  of  germanium  and  90  percent  of  gallium  as  of
2022.* 268  In August  2024,  China  announced  additional  controls  on
antimony,  an  element  that  is  critical  to  a  range  of  applications  in
the electronics and defense industries.† 269

Germanium  and  gallium  are  both  vital  minerals  for  the  produc-
tion of an array of goods, notably semiconductors, solar panels, and
EVs.270  These  minerals  are  primarily  recovered  as  a  byproduct  of
processing  bauxite  (aluminum)  and  zinc  ores  (germanium  is  also
a  byproduct  of  producing  coal).271  The  United  States  has  alterna-
tive domestic sources of germanium, and the U.S. National Defense
Stockpile maintains a germanium reserve, so the controls have pri-
marily  impacted  the  United  States’  gallium  supply.272  The  germa-
nium  stockpile  is  also  being  supplemented  with  a  DOD  program  to
recycle the mineral, further alleviating constraints.273

There is currently no strategic stockpile of gallium, and the Unit-
ed States does not actively produce the mineral. Instead, the United
States  has  been  forced  to  switch  to  alternative  suppliers  that  are
still  able  to  source  the  mineral  from  China.274  Canada,  Germany,
and  Japan  have  continued  to  receive  some  shipments  of  the  miner-
al, but global supply is tight overall.275 In the first eight months of
2024, China cut exports by about one-fifth from its 2023 gallium and
germanium  exports  over  the  same  time  period.276  While  prices  for
germanium  have  risen,  they  have  been  overshadowed  by  gallium’s
prices,  which  have  more  than  doubled  since  Beijing’s  export  con-
trols.277 If China further restricts exports of these minerals, it could
create  downstream  bottlenecks  in  global  semiconductor  production.
Notably, Taiwan  chip  companies,  which  are  integral  to  semiconduc-
tor  supply  chains,  mainly  rely  on  refined  gallium  and  germanium
products  produced  in  Japan  and  Germany,  and  further  controls  on
these  two  countries’  access  to  Chinese  raw  materials  could  have  a
cascading effect.278

Though  the  consequences  of  China’s  impending  controls  on  anti-
mony are not yet clear, the U.S. defense industry may be able to con-
tinue  sourcing  from  other  antimony-producing  countries. Antimony
is  used  by  the  defense  industry  to  produce  armor-piercing  ammu-
nition,  night  vision  goggles,  infrared  sensors,  bullets,  and  precision
optics,  and  by  the  electronics  industry  for  semiconductors,  cables,
and  batteries.279  China  does  not  dominate  antimony  production  to
the same extent as some other critical minerals. China is the United
States’  largest  supplier  and  accounts  for  63  percent  of  U.S.  antimo-
ny  imports.280  In  2023,  China  accounted  for  48  percent  of  global
production, but rising domestic demand meant most output went to
domestic  users  and  the  country  only  accounted  for  17.4  percent  of
global  exports.281  The  United  States  does  not  mine  any  antimony
domestically and is authorized to stockpile a limited 1,100 tons com-
pared to the 22,000 tons consumed in 2023.282 In the month follow-
ing China’s August 2024 announcement of the controls, the price of
antimony climbed by more than 5 percent to $25,000 per ton, more

loss of Chinese supply will raise prices, U.S. defense and electronics
manufacturers  may  be  able  to  turn  to  several  smaller  producers—
such as Belgium, India, and Bolivia—to meet demand.284

Supply  Chain  Diversification  from  China  Is  Occurring,  but

the Extent Remains Unclear

U.S. trade policy since 2017 has helped accelerate a shift in
global  supply  chains  away  from  China.  Starting  in  July  2018,
the United States implemented tariffs on roughly two-thirds of Chi-
nese imports following the completion of a Section 301 investigation
into  Chinese  policies  related  to  technology  transfer  and  intellectu-
al  property  theft.285  These  duties  raised  the  average  U.S.  tariff  on
Chinese  imports  to  19.3  percent  at  the  end  of  2020,  compared  to
the 3 percent average for other countries.* 286 The U.S. Internation-
al  Trade  Commission  estimates  that  the  Section  301  trade  action
caused U.S. imports to fall by 13 percent between 2018 and 2021 on
average  in  sectors  impacted  by  the  tariffs.287 Alongside  other  trade
actions, these duties contributed to a decline in China’s share of U.S.
imports,  which  fell  to  13.1  percent  of  total  U.S.  imports  in  the  year
through  August  2024  from  20.9  percent  in  2017.288  In  May  2024,
the United States announced it would retain existing China Section
301 tariffs and expand them to cover key technology subsectors, in-
cluding  100  percent  tariffs  on  EVs  and  50  percent  tariffs  on  solar
cells.289  (For  more  on  the  design  and  impact  of  U.S.  trade  policy
toward China, see Chapter 6, “Key Economic Strategies for Leveling
the U.S.-China Playing Field.”)

An increasing share of U.S. imports came from third coun-
tries.  As  analyzed  in  a  number  of  recent  studies,  other  foreign
suppliers  stepped  in  to  supply  products  where  China’s  share  of  the
U.S.  import  market  declined  rapidly.290  Mexico  and  Vietnam  both
increased  their  shares  of  U.S.  imports  by  roughly  2  percent—more
than  any  other  economy.291  Between  January  and  August  2024,
shipments  from  Mexico  and  Vietnam  accounted  for  15.7  percent
and  4  percent  of  all  U.S.  imports,  respectively.292  Mexico  ostensibly
overtook  China  as  the  largest  supplier  to  the  United  States  for  the
first  time  in  20  years,  although  this  gap  may  be  overstated  due  to
the unaccounted data on U.S. de minimis imports from China.† 293

These  shifts  appear  to  be  largely  driven  by  U.S.  trade  measures.
Mexico  and  Vietnam  ramped  up  exports  to  the  United  States  of
products impacted by China Section 301 duties, while their exports
to  the  United  States  of  other  products  not  covered  by  those  duties
remained  steady  (see  Figure  5).  By  the  end  of  2023,  Mexico  and
Vietnam  were  the  source  of  21.8  percent  of  the  United  States’  to-
tal imports of products covered by Section 301 duties, up from 17.8

tion estimates that between October 2023 and June 2024, an additional $47.8 billion in imports
entered  under  de  minimis  from  all  source  countries,  the  majority  of  which  come  from  China.

percent at the end of 2017.294 The Office of the U.S. Trade Represen-
tative  assesses  that  imports  to  the  United  States  of  products  from
China subject to higher Section 301 duties saw more significant de-
clines  overall,  reflecting  how  tariffs  played  a  key  role  in  reshaping
U.S.  trade  patterns.295  However,  as  Figure  5  shows,  over  the  past
two years, imports to the United States of products from China not
subject to additional duties have also begun to slow, indicating that
a  broader  diversification  of  trade  away  from  China  may  be  emerg-
ing.* 296

Though  a  portion  of  U.S.-China  trade  shifted  to  other  sources,
the  full  reduction  in  U.S.  dependence  on  Chinese  production  re-
mains  unclear  given  the  presence  of  Chinese  inputs  embedded
in  manufacturing  in  these  economies.  Edmund  Malesky,  profes-
sor  of  political  economy  and  director  of  the  Duke  Center  for  In-
ternational  Development  at  Duke  University,  testified  that  the
shift  toward  Vietnam  reflects  three  broad  patterns:  “1)  the  con-
tinuation  of  pre-tariff  shifts  in  production  caused  by  increasing
Chinese  wages  and  growing  Vietnamese  productivity;  2)  imme-
diate  post-tariff  increases  in  production  by  existing  manufactur-
ers  in Vietnam;  and  3)  post-tariff  manufacturing  investment  and
exporting  by  multinational  companies  of  multiple  origins.” 298  A
group  of  economists  found  that  countries  that  increased  exports

to  the  United  States  after  2017  appeared  to  rely  on  inputs  from
China  to  scale  production.299  Another  study  found  the  increase
in  Mexico’s  exports  to  the  United  States  since  2018  was  main-
ly  driven  by  companies  with  supply  chains  linked  to  China  and
the  rest  of Asia.* 300  In  quantitative  terms,  China’s  share  of  val-
ue  added  embedded  in  third  country  exports  has  increased.  In
the  case  of  Vietnam’s  manufacturing  sector,  intermediate  inputs
sourced from China accounted for 18.5 percent of the value added
in  its  exports  in  2020,  up  from  15.2  percent  in  2017.301  China’s
value-added  share  in  Mexico’s  manufacturing  exports  rose  from
8.1  percent  to  9.5  percent  over  the  same  period.302  In  addition,
some  of  China’s  exports  likely  continue  to  enter  the  U.S.  via  ille-
gal transshipment through a third market. (For more on customs

Foreign  Multinational  Companies  Place  Lower  Priority  on

Investment in China

New  foreign  direct  investment  (FDI)  in  China  fell  as
U.S. and other foreign companies slowed expansion inside
China.  According  to  China’s  Ministry  of  Commerce,  new  foreign
investment  actually  utilized  in  2023  amounted  to  $151  billion
(RMB  1.1  trillion),  down  eight  percent  from  the  previous  year.303
New  FDI  continued  to  slow  in  2024,  falling  31.5  percent  year-
on-year  in  the  first  eight  months  of  2024.304  The  sharp  decline
is  consistent  with  falling  interest  by  U.S.  companies.  According
to  an  American  Chamber  of  Commerce  in  China  (AmCham  Chi-
na)  survey  conducted  at  the  end  of  2023,  just  over  half  of  U.S.
firms in China planned to expand their investments inside China.
Though  this  number  increased  slightly  over  the  previous  year’s
45  percent  level,  it  remains  the  second-lowest  surveyed  result  in
at least a decade (see Figure 6).305 Businesses cited uncertainties
in  the  U.S.-China  economic  relationship  and  concerns  about  an
uncertain  Chinese  policy  environment  as  their  top  reasons  for
avoiding  investment  expansions.306  Other  foreign  multinationals
also  appeared  to  slow  expansion  inside  China. According  to  2023
survey  data  collected  by  the  Japan  External Trade  Organization,
less  than  30  percent  of  Japanese  businesses  are  planning  to  ex-
pand  inside  China,  the  lowest  level  in  the  survey’s  history.307

China’s  high-profile  efforts  to  boost  inbound  investment
largely failed to mitigate foreign businesses’ concerns about
operating in China. In 2023, China’s Ministry of Commerce orga-
nized  a  series  of  events  to  attract  foreign  businesses.308  In  March
2024,  General  Secretary  Xi  hosted  more  than  a  dozen  U.S.  CEOs
for a meeting in Beijing.* 309 The  meeting was widely  publicized  by
Chinese  state  media  as  China  pushed  a  narrative  that  it  is  recep-
tive  to  foreign  business.310  Xi  conveyed  to  the  group  that  China  is
committed  to  reforming  and  opening  up  its  economy.  He  called  for
closer economic ties with the United States.311 In March 2024, Chi-
na’s State Council also released a 24-point “action plan” that prom-
ised various measures to facilitate investment, including a pledge to
remove restrictions on additional sectors currently closed to foreign
investment,  easing  restrictions  on  cross-border  data  flows,  and  eas-
ing  visa  requirements  for  travel.† 312  Many  of  these  pledges  reflect
previous  commitments  that  China  has  repeatedly  failed  to  fulfill.
For instance, the action plan includes pledges to eliminate discrimi-
nation against foreign businesses in government procurement, echo-

* Numerous analysts and media outlets observed that China carefully managed the delegation
and  its  members.  Notably,  the  group  of  U.S.  CEOs  was  entirely  male.  Laura  He  and  Wayne

also  eased  visa  requirements  for  visiting  China  as  a  tourist.  Since  China  reopened  its  border  to
tourism in early 2023, China has expanded its visa-free entry program, permitting more tourists
to  travel  to  China  without  first  applying  for  a  visa  with  a  Chinese  embassy.  Bloomberg, “China

However,  these  attempts  to  attract  foreign  investment  seemed
incongruous  with  China’s  “anti-espionage”  actions  and  a  crack-
down  on  foreign  access  to  information  Beijing  views  as  state  se-
crets  but  some  argue  is  routine  financial  and  economic  data.  In
2023,  Chinese  security  officials  raided  the  offices  of  the  U.S.  due
diligence  firm  Mintz  Group  and  the  U.S.  corporate  advisory  Bain
& Co.314 The Mintz Group was accused of conducting “foreign-re-
lated  statistical  investigations”  and  subjected  to  a  $1.5  million
fine by the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Statistics.315 In February
2024,  the  bureau  increased  the  fine  to  roughly  $2.2  million.† 316
According  to  Reuters,  Mintz  was  engaged  in  due  diligence  work
that  included  assessing  the  supply  chain  presence  of  Xinjiang
forced  labor  prior  to  its  March  2023  police  raid,  and  Chinese  au-
thorities  had  given  due  diligence  firms  warnings  about  conduct-
ing  such  investigations.‡ 317

U.S.  corporate  advisory  firms  have  started  to  restrict  their  op-
erations inside China following the raids. In November 2023, the
U.S.  polling  and  consulting  group  Gallup  reportedly  informed  its
clients  that  it  was  closing  its  offices  in  China,  which  mainly  pro-
vided corporate governance and marketing consulting to Chinese
companies.318 In June 2024, Bain & Co.’s global head Christophe
De  Vusser  announced  that  the  company  is  refraining  from  ad-
vising  certain  industries  in  China.319  Speaking  to  the  Financial
Times,  he  said,  “There  is  a  clear  set  of  sensitive  industries  that
are  at  the  heart  of  discussions  from  a  geopolitical  basis.  So  in
these  industries  we  will  indeed  operate  less  frequently.” 320  Chi-
na’s  opaque  and  unpredictable  crackdown  on  corporate  consult-
ing, due diligence, and data collection further narrows the quality
and  quantity  of  business  intelligence  for  foreign  firms  seeking  to
operate  within  China’s  economy. The  crackdown  not  only  creates
challenges  for  analyzing  the  risk  associated  with  business  trans-
actions  but  also  increases  the  difficulty  of  ensuring  that  transac-
tions  comply  with  U.S.  regulations  and  laws,  including  sanctions
and  export  controls  (see  textbox).321

* On July 4, 2024, China released a separate document setting out a three-year action plan for
making  government  procurement  fairer.  However,  details  of  how  this  plan  will  be  implemented
and enforced remain vague, particularly at the local level. China’s Foreign Investment Law, which
was  implemented  in  2020,  states  that  China  will  provide  fair  treatment  in  the  procurement
process,  but  foreign  businesses  continue  to  report  that  Chinese  businesses  receive  preference.
Given  that  the  Party-state’s  other  priorities  call  for  reducing  dependence  on  foreign  suppliers
in  key  technologies,  it  is  unclear  whether  China  will  establish  a  procurement  regime  that  is
genuinely fair in practice. Trivium Markets, “All Equal if Made in China,” July 5, 2024; American

that  it  is  unclear  if  Mintz  had  received  either  the  initial  notice  or  the  February  2024  penalty.

China Adds Significant Risks to Routine
Business Activities

Foreign businesses in China find themselves in a bind between
complying  with  U.S.  and  other  applicable  rules  and  avoiding
crossing  ambiguously  defined  red  lines  under  China’s  expanding
set of rules and administrative measures. On September 24, 2024,
China’s  Ministry  of  Commerce  announced  an  investigation  into
U.S.  clothing  company  PVH  Corp.,  whose  brands  include Tommy
Hilfiger  and  Calvin  Klein,  for  violations  of  “principles  of  normal
market  transactions”  by  “discriminating”  against  products  pro-
duced  in  Xinjiang.322  PVH  said  in  July  2020  that  it  would  cease
sourcing  from  factories  and  mills  in  Xinjiang  due  to  forced  la-
bor  concerns.* 323  Xinjiang  was  the  source  of  23  percent  of  the
global supply of cotton in 2020 and 2021.324 The Chinese govern-
ment’s  investigation,  which  was  still  ongoing  as  of  October  11,
2024,  could  result  in  PVH  being  added  to  its  “unreliable  entity”
list †  and  subjected  to  fines,  restrictions,  or  other  penalties.325
Though  other  multinational  fashion  companies  have  faced  scru-
tiny  in  the  past  over  their  statements  on  Xinjiang—in  2021,  the
Swedish  fashion  company  H&M  and  several  other  brands  faced
an ostensibly grassroots boycott in China after state media drew
attention  to  pledges  by  these  companies  to  stop  sourcing  from
the region—the latest action against PVH marks an escalation in
the  Party-state’s  willingness  to  utilize  its  sanction  authorities  to
coerce foreign businesses.326

China’s  National  Security  Law  has  also  created  new  risks  for
businesses. China has expanded the reach of its national security
apparatus  over  the  past  two  years,  increasing  the  risk  that  for-
eign  businesses  face  investigations  and  prosecution  for  carrying
out  normal  business  activities.  (For  more  on  legislative  chang-
es  to  China’s  Counterespionage  Law  and  State  Secrets  Law,  see
Chapter 7, “China’s New Measures for Control, Mobilization, and
Resilience.”) The potential for retaliation, coupled with expansive
restrictions  on  foreign  access  to  data  and  information  deemed
sensitive  by  the  Party-state,  have  complicated  U.S.  business-
es’  ability  to  do  basic  corporate  due  diligence  or  to  comply  with
home-market regulations that implicate China.327 The worsening
information environment means U.S. businesses face greater diffi-

* PVH’s pledge mirrored moves by other multinational apparel companies to shift their supply
chains  out  of  Xinjiang  to  mitigate  the  risk  of  supporting  China’s  forced  labor  practices  as  well
as  to  comply  with  the  Uyghur  Forced  Labor  Prevention Act,  which  took  effect  in  June  2022  and
created  a  rebuttable  presumption  that  products  from  Xinjiang  are  made  with  forced  labor  and
consequently denied entry to the United States. Keith Bradsher and Ana Swanson, “For Compa-
nies in China, Pulling Out of Xinjiang Poses ‘Messy Dilemma,’ ” New York Times, October 7, 2024;

† China’s  Ministry  of  Commerce  promulgated  the  Provisions  on  the  Unreliable  Entity  List
in  2020,  creating  a  mechanism  to  investigate  and  penalize  foreign  companies  for  taking  ac-
tions  perceived  as  harmful  to  China’s  interests.  As  of  October  8,  2024,  China  has  placed
five  U.S.  defense  firms  on  the  list  for  selling  military  equipment  to  Taiwan,  halting  these
companies’  imports  and  exports  from  China,  prohibiting  investments  in  China,  and  barring
their  senior  management  from  entering  China.  If  added,  PVH  would  be  the  first  U.S.  compa-
ny  placed  on  the  list  because  of  its  efforts  to  prevent  forced  labor  in  its  supply  chain.  Lester

China Adds Significant Risks to Routine
Business Activities—Continued
culty in meeting their obligations to ensure counterparties in Chi-
na are not subject to export controls, U.S. investment restrictions,
sanctions,  the  Uyghur  Forced  Labor  Prevention  Act,  and  other
requirements under U.S. and other applicable laws.328

A growing number of U.S. companies active in China are shifting
to sourcing from other countries. According to the AmCham survey,
23  percent  of  respondents  indicated  they  had  begun  or  were  con-
sidering  relocating  manufacturing  and/or  sourcing  out  of  China.329
According to the survey, the top three destinations for relocated ca-
pacity  were  other  developing  economies  in Asia,  the  United  States,
and Mexico/Canada.330 This trend was partially driven by increased
trade  tensions,  but  geopolitical  tensions,  uncertainty  about  the  di-
rection of China’s domestic policies, and rising manufacturing costs
inside  China  additionally  drove  importers  to  find  alternatives  to
China.331

Chinese  Companies  Face  Barriers  to  Listing  on  U.S.  Stock

Exchanges

Chinese  regulators  continue  to  constrain  Chinese  compa-
nies  from  listing  overseas  on  U.S.  stock  exchanges.  Just  23
Chinese  issuers  have  listed  on  a  major  U.S.  stock  exchange  in  the
first three quarters of 2024, and the combined initial public offering
(IPO)  proceeds  totaled  $1.1  billion.332  Over  40  percent  of  this  total
was  raised  by  one  company,  the  Geely-affiliated  EV  maker  Zeekr.
The  2024  deal  volume  amounts  to  just  a  fraction  of  the  listing  ac-
tivity in 2021, just before Chinese regulators clamped down on new
overseas  listings  and  increased  oversight  over  Chinese  companies’
global fundraising activity.* In 2022, China implemented new rules
requiring  that  internet  companies  seeking  to  list  overseas  under-
go  a  cybersecurity  review  to  assess  the  company’s  compliance  with
China’s  regulations  on  cross-border  data  flows.† 333  In  2023,  CSRC
established  a  revised  approval  process  for  companies  going  public
overseas.334 Under this new approval mechanism, all companies are
required to register their listing with the CSRC, enabling regulators
to block any proposed listing that violates China’s laws and regula-
tions or poses risks to national security and the CCP.‡ Although the

* In  the  first  three  quarters  of  2021,  41  companies  went  public  on  major  U.S.  exchanges  and
raised $13 billion in funding. This includes the $4.4 billion raised by ride-hailing app Didi Glob-
al  in  its  blockbuster  IPO.  Didi  reportedly  proceeded  with  its  IPO  plans  despite  objections  from
the  Cybersecurity  Administration  of  China,  leading  to  Chinese  regulators  freezing  all  Chinese
overseas  IPO  activity  for  several  months.  Based  on  historical  data  from  an  internal  version  of

† In February 2022, the Cyberspace Administration of China introduced a data security review
mechanism  for  companies  seeking  to  list  overseas.  The  mechanism  was  made  mandatory  for
Chinese companies that collect personal information on more than one million users. Cyberspace
Administration of China, Cybersecurity Review Measures (网络安全审查办法), December 28, 2021.

‡ Notably, this review requirement applied to companies listing overseas using variable interest
entity (VIE) structures—complex corporate structures that many Chinese issuers used to circum-
vent  restrictions  on  foreign  ownership  by  granting  shareholders  contractual  claims  to  control  in
lieu of actual ownership. Prior to 2023, Chinese companies that listed overseas using a VIE were

CSRC’s approval mechanism nominally established rules for compa-
nies that align with Beijing’s economic priorities to raise capital on
foreign markets, the mechanism instead created a regulatory logjam
for Chinese companies attempting to list overseas.335 It remains un-
clear if Beijing will accelerate approvals for overseas listings on U.S.
exchanges.  In April  2024,  the  CSRC  pledged  to  facilitate  listings  in
Hong Kong, likely reflecting a preference among Chinese policymak-
ers for companies to list on exchanges under the ultimate control of
Beijing.336

Delisted Chinese Issuers Continue to Trade on
Over-the-Counter Markets
After delisting their shares from a major U.S. exchange, a num-
ber  of  Chinese  companies  have  continued  to  access  global  inves-
tors  via  the  more  loosely  regulated  U.S.  over-the-counter  (OTC)
markets.  OTC  markets  have  traditionally  been  available  to  com-
panies  that  do  not  meet  the  requirements  for  listing  on  a  major
stock  exchange.337 These  markets  operate  through  decentralized
dealer  networks  that  facilitate  private  party-to-party  exchanges,
and issuers face less stringent disclosure requirements compared
to  a  major  stock  exchange.  In  particular,  the  Pink  Open  Market,
an OTC market that is operated by the OTC Markets Group and
is  the  most  speculative  open  market  provided  by  the  group,  has
much  looser  financial  standards  or  reporting  requirements  than
the major U.S. exchanges.338 Despite these limitations, some large
Chinese  companies  have  moved  their  listings  to  OTC  markets
after  removing  them  from  a  major  U.S.  exchange. The  biggest  of
these  is  Chinese  ride-hailing  giant  Didi  Global,  which  exited  the
New York  Stock  Exchange  in  2022  under  pressure  from  Chinese
regulators.* At  the  end  of  June  2024,  Didi  continued  to  trade  on
OTC  Pink  with  a  market  capitalization  of  $20  billion,  making  it
the  largest  company  primarily  traded  off-exchange  in  the  Unit-
ed  States.339  Other  companies  traded  on  OTC  markets  include
Luckin Coffee, which was forcibly delisted by the Nasdaq in 2020
following  an  accounting  scandal  involving  fabricated  sales  and
financial  figures,  as  well  as  a  number  of  Chinese  SOEs  that  ap-
peared to remove their listings from the main U.S. bourses under
direction  from  China’s  government  in  late  2022.340  Despite  the
higher risk associated with stocks listed OTC, some U.S. investors
continue to trade these shares.341

Activity  around  Chinese  stocks  in  the  United  States  re-
mains  muted  as  U.S.  policymakers  increase  scrutiny  of  Chi-
nese  listings.  In  November  2023,  the  Chinese  fast-fashion  compa-

not  required  to  register  their  listings  with  the  CSRC,  as  the  VIE  is  not  considered  a  Chinese
company under China’s law.

* Didi  reportedly  proceeded  with  its  June  2021  IPO  on  the  New York  Stock  Exchange  (NYSE)
despite warnings from China’s government to delay the listing until it completed a cybersecurity
review. Subsequently, the Cybersecurity Administration of China prevented Didi from registering
new  users,  ordered  the  removal  of  Didi’s  apps  from  Chinese  stores,  and  launched  a  probe  into
Didi’s  alleged  violation  of  China’s  data  laws.  One  year  later,  Didi  shareholders  approved  the
company’s plan to delist from the NYSE. Didi stated that this delisting was a precondition set by
the Chinese government for allowing the company to resume user registrations. Cissy Zhou, “Didi
to Exit NYSE on June 10 amid Uncertainty about China Restart,” Nikkei Asia, June 9, 2022.

ny  and  e-commerce  platform  operator  Shein *  reportedly  filed  to  go
public  in  the  United  States  in  what  would  have  been  the  largest
U.S. IPO since Uber’s 2019 listing, with the company expected to be
valued at $66 billion.† 342 However, the planned listing subsequently
faced  scrutiny  from  U.S.  policymakers  over  the  company’s  report-
ed  use  of  forced  labor  in  its  supply  chains.343  A  Bloomberg  inves-
tigation  published  in  November  2022  cross-referenced  climate  and
weather signatures on cotton fabrics used in clothing from Shein to
determine  that  they  originated  in  Xinjiang,  potentially  in  violation
of restrictions on imports from the region under the Uyghur Forced
Labor Prevention Act.‡ 344 Due to pressure from U.S. lawmakers and
regulators, Shein has reportedly shelved its plans to list in the Unit-
ed  States,  and  is  instead  exploring  a  listing  on  the  London  Stock
Exchange.345  National  security  concerns  have  been  raised  about
U.S.-listed  Chinese  LiDAR  company  Hesai.§  DOD  added  Hesai  to
its list of Chinese military companies in January 2024, although the
Financial Times reported in August 2024 that DOD had reversed its
determination  and  plans  to  remove  the  company  from  the  list.¶ 346
At  the  same  time,  other  Chinese  companies  have  surged  on  U.S.
stock  exchanges.  Pinduoduo,  a  major  Chinese  e-commerce  company
that  operates  its  eponymous  marketplace  in  China  as  well  as  the
Temu  e-commerce  platform  outside  of  China,  had  seen  its  market
capitalization  increase  on  the  Nasdaq  by  more  than  50  percent  be-
tween January 2023 and June 2024.347 Despite Temu being subject
to  U.S.  congressional  inquiry  over  links  to  forced  labor,  Pinduoduo
is one of the two largest Chinese stocks listed in the United States
by  market  capitalization,  following  Chinese  e-platform  giant Aliba-
ba.348  Combined,  Alibaba  and  Pinduoduo  accounted  for  46  percent
of the total market capitalization of all Chinese companies listed on
major U.S. exchanges, with their valuations reaching $441 billion at
the end of September 2024.349

† Though Shein is formally headquartered in Singapore, it likely would still need approval from
Chinese regulators to list overseas given its extensive operations inside China. Shein reportedly
approached the Cyberspace Administration of  China  and  CSRC for approval to list overseas fol-
lowing  its  IPO  filing.  Nonetheless,  Shein  has  sought  to  portray  itself  as  a  non-Chinese  company
as it seeks to proceed with its overseas IPO. James Kynge, Sun Yu, and Ryan McMorrow, “Shein

face  of  mounting  tensions  with  trade  partners  wary  of  Bei-
jing’s  damaging  trade  practices. The United States and the EU
have  each  announced  tariffs  on  Chinese-made  EVs  and  other  im-
ports  that  threaten  to  undercut  domestic  producers  in  key  indus-
tries.* In defiance of the U.S.-led sanctions regime, China continues
to  offer  material  support  to  Russia,  acting  opportunistically  to  win
energy  concessions  and  promote  alternative  payment  systems.  (For
further discussion of China’s support for Russia’s war of aggression
in Ukraine, see Chapter 2, “U.S.-China Security and Foreign Affairs
(Year  in  Review).”)  Meanwhile,  China  has  retooled  its  flagship  Belt
and  Road  Initiative  (BRI)  to  limit  its  exposure  to  risk  of  default.  It
is again increasing lending throughout the developing world, though
this  time  mainly  in  the  form  of  emergency  rescue  loans  to  bail  out
indebted countries rather than fund new infrastructure projects.

China’s Economic Relations with Advanced Economies Come

under Strain

Business  climate  chills  between  European  capitals  and
Beijing  as  EU  investigation  brings  about  retaliatory  tariffs
to  stem  Chinese  export  of  overcapacity.  Last  year,  goods  trade
between the EU and China declined for the first time in over a de-
cade, down 13.8 percent year-over-year.350 China still constitutes the
largest  origin  for  EU  goods  imports  (20.5  percent  of  the  total)  and
the  third-largest  market  for  EU  goods  exports  (8.8  percent).351 Yet
signs  of  a  potential  protracted  decline  in  economic  engagement  be-
tween two of the world’s largest economies have emerged. The Euro-
pean Chamber of Commerce in China’s most recent annual business
confidence survey found only 42 percent of European companies are
considering expanding operations in China in 2024, the lowest level
on  record.352  Companies  cited  China’s  economic  slowdown,  overca-
pacity,  and  regulatory  barriers  among  their  top  concerns,  with  68
percent of those surveyed saying conducting business in China had
become more difficult, the highest level on record.353

China’s  unfair  trade  practices  have  become  a  matter  of  acute
concern  for  European  governments.  In  late  2023,  the  European
Commission  launched  an  investigation  into  Chinese  subsidies  for
EVs.354 Despite the decline in total goods trade in 2023, automotive
imports from China grew sharply by 36.7 percent year-over-year.355
Preliminary  findings  released  in  June  2024  found  EU  carmakers
were being harmed by unfair Chinese subsidization of their domes-
tic EV value chain.356 In July, the EU imposed tariffs between 17.4
percent and 37.6 percent on select Chinese automotive makers † on
top of the existing 10 percent tariff on all vehicle imports.357 Beijing
has signaled the potential for retaliatory tariffs, which may further

* In  August  2024,  Canada  also  announced  it  would  impose  a  100  percent  tariff  on  imports  of
Chinese EVs and a 25 percent tariff on imported steel and aluminum from China, with the mea-
sures taking effect in October 2024. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau referenced China’s intention-
al, state-directed policy of overcapacity as the rationale for the tariffs. Lisa Xing, “Chinese-Made
EVs Are Now Subject to a 100% Tariff. What Does This Mean for Canadians?” CBC News, October

exacerbate tensions alongside contributing factors like China’s ongo-
ing  support  for  Russia  and  increasingly  brazen  attempts  to  silence
dissidents residing in European countries.358

Chinese  EV  companies  have  moved  to  offshore  manufacturing  in
a  hedge  against  rising  trade  tensions. They  have  found  a  receptive
partner  in  Hungary,  where  Chinese  battery  maker  Contemporary
Amperex Technology Co., Ltd (CATL) began building Europe’s larg-
est  battery  factory  in  2022,  and  this  year  BYD  announced  plans  to
build  its  first  European  EV  production  facility  in  the  southern  city
of  Szeged.359  During  his  May  visit  to  France,  Serbia,  and  Hungary,
Xi  said  during  a  press  event  with  Hungarian  Prime  Minister  Vik-
tor  Orbán  that  China  and  Hungary  would  embark  down  a  “golden
path” together, reiterating China’s commitment to their comprehen-
sive strategic partnership.360 Xi’s trip and fervent support for Prime
Minister Orbán were widely seen as intended to sow division in the
EU bloc.* 361

Emerging  Economies  Become  Increasingly  Concerned  with

Excess Chinese Exports

Chinese  exports  to  emerging  economies  have  drastically
grown, straining trade ties and causing certain governments
to launch trade investigations and impose tariffs on Chinese
imports. As  advanced  economies  implement  tariffs,  China  is  shift-
ing exports of manufactured goods to emerging economies, enlarging
its  bilateral  trade  surpluses  across  the  developing  world.  Between
2019  and  2023,  China’s  manufacturing  trade  surplus  with  ASEAN
more  than  doubled,  rising  from  $96  billion  to  $231  billion.362  Chi-
nese exports to Latin America and the Caribbean are increasing at
a rapid pace as well. For example, China’s trade surplus with Mexi-
co reached $68 billion in 2023, almost doubling from $35.1 billion in
2019.363 China is also increasingly offshoring production capacity by
building factories in “connector countries” at least in part to circum-
vent  trade  restrictions  in  overseas  markets.364  (For  further  discus-
sion on issues pertaining to Chinese overseas manufacturing trends,
see the section “Chinese State Support for Overseas Manufacturing
Likely Perpetuates Economic Distortions” in Chapter 4, “Unsafe and
Unregulated Chinese Consumer Goods: Challenges in Enforcing Im-
port  Regulations  and  Laws.”)  An  overreliance  on  Chinese  exports
can harm both the local economy and U.S. interests. Emerging mar-
ket governments may be wary that Chinese companies’ local market
power  could  undercut  their  domestic  industries  and  make  certain
firms vulnerable to Chinese anticompetitive practices, such as with-
holding supply or colluding to raise prices.365 Chinese dominance of
supply  chains  also  exposes  emerging  economies  to  market  disrup-
tions such as pandemic-like external shocks and potential economic
coercion.366

Emerging  market  officials  have  begun  to  act  to  protect
specific  industries  through  trade  investigations  and  tariffs.
In  the  past  year,  emerging  markets  including  Argentina,  Brazil,
India,  and  Vietnam  have  launched  anti-dumping  and  anti-subsidy

investigations  against  China,  and  Indonesia,  Mexico,  South  Africa,
and Turkey  have  all  imposed  tariffs  on  certain  Chinese  imports.367
However,  rising  Chinese  imports  can  create  dilemmas  for  emerging
economy  officials  whose  economies  are  more  dependent  on  China
and more vulnerable to potential retaliation than the United States
or the EU.368 To avoid broader disruptions to their trading relation-
ships with China, emerging economies may be forced to impose trade
restrictions and other localization policies that could be weaker than
required and insufficient to stem the flow of Chinese exports.369

China Enhances Economic Support for Russia

Record  bilateral  trade  volumes  support  Russia’s  wartime
economy,  blunting  the  impact  of  international  sanctions. To-
tal two-way trade between Russia and China reached $240.1 billion
in  2023,  up  26.3  percent  from  $190  billion  a  year  earlier  and  60.4
percent from 2021 levels, the last full year of data before Russia’s in-
vasion of Ukraine.370 Given that Russia’s total trade with the world
declined  9.6  percent  between  2021  and  2023  from  $785.8  billion  to
$710.2 billion, the Russian economy is increasingly reliant on trade
with  China  to  stay  afloat.371  Though  Russian  President  Vladimir
Putin  praised  the  level  of  cooperation  and  Xi  pronounced  a  “new
era”  in  the  “no  limits”  partnership  between  their  countries  during
his May visit to Beijing, Moscow may come to resent the asymmetry
in the relationship.372

China  continues  to  increase  purchases  of  Russian  energy
exports  hit  by  Western  sanctions,  leveraging  its  neighbor’s
limited  options  to  obtain  favorable  long-term  price  conces-
sions.  Chinese  imports  of  Russian  crude  oil  were  up  17  percent
year-over-year  through  April  and  now  comprise  21  percent  of  Chi-
na’s  total  crude  imports.373  Russia  surpassed  Saudi Arabia  as  Chi-
na’s  top  foreign  crude  oil  supplier  in  2023.374  Coal  and  natural  gas
exports  from  Russia  to  China  have  both  doubled  in  the  time  since
Russia invaded Ukraine.375 A point of major interest for Moscow is
closing a deal with Beijing on the proposed Power of Siberia 2 pipe-
line  that  would  carry  eastward  to  China  50  billion  cubic  meters  of
natural  gas *  per  year,  almost  half  the  natural  gas  that  previously
flowed westward from the Yamal Peninsula to European markets.376
However,  Beijing  continues  to  slow-walk  the  deal,  a  dynamic  that
allows  Chinese  importers  to  negotiate  favorable  prices  in  contracts
not  only  with  Russian  suppliers  but  also  with  suppliers  from  other
countries trepid to lose market share.377 According to analysis from
Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy, China would
be reliant on piped gas from Russia for 40 percent of its net imports
if Power of Siberia 2 came online. This scenario would diminish the
need  for  liquified  natural  gas  shipped  by  sea  from  future  potential
adversaries  like  the  United  States  and  Australia,  who  may  cut  off
supply  and  impose  a  naval  blockade  if  a  conflict  broke  out.  On  the
other  hand,  building  the  pipeline  would  put  China’s  gas  imports
from Russia on par with the EU’s dependency on the eve of the war
in  Ukraine,  a  situation  of  overreliance  Beijing  has  long  been  reluc-

* Natural  gas  accounted  for  7.8  percent  of  China’s  total  energy  supply  in  2022,  compared  to
61 percent from coal and 17.9 percent from oil. For more on China’s energy mix and reliance on
imports, see Chapter 7, “China’s New Measures for Control, Mobilization, and Resilience.” Inter-

tant  to  abide.378  For  the  time  being,  Beijing  is  unlikely  to  feel  the
need to finalize an agreement unless the price is too low to forgo.

Chinese exports and transshipment of dual-use technology
and goods have surged, aiding Russia’s war effort in Ukraine.
Since the invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the Commerce De-
partment—in  coordination  with  the  EU,  Japan,  and  the  UK—has
maintained  and  periodically  updated  the  Common  High  Priority
List  (CHPL),*  a  tiered  list  of  dual-use  items  Russia  seeks  to  ac-
quire for its weapons programs subject to U.S.-led export controls.379
While  no  public  evidence  existed  as  of  October  11,  2024  to  show
China  is  providing  lethal  aid †  to  Russia,  it  has  substantially  in-
creased the sale of items included on the CHPL both directly to Rus-
sia and to countries suspected of reexporting to Russia.380 According
to  analysis  from  the  Atlantic  Council,  China’s  monthly  exports  of
CHPL items increased steadily in the leadup to February 2022, then
fell  off  after  the  initial  imposition  of  export  controls  before  steadily
climbing from July 2022 to higher levels than pre-invasion.381 These
higher levels have been sustained since.382 In 2023, China exported
$4.5  billion  of  CHPL  goods  to  Russia.383  In  particular,  the  sale  of
integrated circuits such as those used in precision-guided munitions
increased  from  a  monthly  average  of  $5.3  million  in  2021  to  $13.7
million in 2023.384 Even more stark is the rising supply of Comput-
er  Numerically  Controlled  (CNC)  machine  tools  and  parts  used  to
manufacture a variety of industrial products including vehicles and
weapons, which rose from a monthly average of $7.4 million in 2021
to $66.6 million in 2023.385

Beijing Retools Lending as BRI Enters Second Decade

Chinese overseas lending has recovered steadily from pan-
demic-era  lows  as  Beijing  reshapes  development  financing
to mitigate its risk.386 Lending to foreign countries under China’s
flagship international development program, BRI, increased 18 per-
cent year-over-year in 2023 to $92.4 billion,‡ a level still well off the
annual peak of nearly $120 billion recorded  in  2018.387 A  combina-
tion  of  factors  led  China  to  pull  back  BRI  lending  starting  in  2019,
among  them  uncertainty  brought  on  by  the  COVID-19  pandemic,

* As  of  February  23,  2024,  there  are  50  items  included  on  the  Common  High  Priority  List.
Tier  1  items  of  highest  concern  include  a  broad  range  of  electronic  integrated  circuits  used  in
precision-guided  weapons  systems  for  which  Russia  has  no  domestic  production  capacity; Tier  2
items  include  electronic  components  Russia  can  produce  but  prefers  to  source  from  the  United
States  and  partners  and  allies;  Tier  3.A  includes  electronic  components  with  a  broad  range  of
suppliers;  Tier  3.B  includes  mechanical  and  other  components  such  as  ball  and  roller  bearings,
airplane and helicopter parts, optics, navigation equipment, etc.; Tier 4.A includes manufacturing
equipment  for  electronic  components;  and  Tier  4.B  includes  Computer  Numerically  Controlled
(CNC) machines and components used in mechanical and metal manufacturing. U.S. Department
of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security, Common High Priority List, February 23, 2024.

† The  Biden  Administration  has  repeatedly  claimed  China  is  providing  “nonlethal”  support  to
Russia  but  disagreed  with  a  claim  in  March  2024  by  the  British  Defense  Secretary  that  China
was  supplying  lethal  aid,  saying Washington  did  not  share  the  assessment.  Reid  Standish, “U.S.

‡ By  comparison,  the  United  States  provided  $63.5  billion  in  official  development  assistance
(ODA)  in  2023  and  $228.7  billion  when  combined  with  private  flows  of  development  assistance.

slowing  domestic  growth,  and  fears  of  insolvency  of  borrower  na-
tions struggling to service high levels of sovereign debt.388 However,
the  composition  of  Chinese  development  lending  has  changed,  with
investment deals * making up a greater portion of total lending than
construction  projects  for  the  first  time  in  2023.389  This  change  in
composition  reflects  both  the  scaling  back  of  grandiose  infrastruc-
ture  projects  that  were  common  early  on  in  BRI  as  well  as  a  move
to  provide  capital  to  borrower  economies.  In  his  speech  during  the
third  BRI  Summit  in  October  2023,  Xi  painted  a  picture  of  moving
from  large-scale  projects  to  “fine  brushstrokes,”  metaphorically  de-
scribing many smaller projects.390

China  moves  unilaterally  to  secure  payment  from  debt-
strapped  borrower  nations,  undermining  international  ef-
forts to alleviate debt burdens. China is now the world’s largest
official debt collector, with an estimated $1.1 trillion to $1.5 trillion
of debt outstanding from foreign borrowers.391 China has used BRI
lending as a strategy to exert leverage over less developed countries
and  shore  up  access  to  key  resources  like  critical  minerals,  with
Chinese SOEs taking up equity stakes in mining operations on five
continents.† 392 According to data from William & Mary research lab
AidData, 80 percent of China’s overseas lending portfolio is to coun-
tries  in  financial  distress.393  Currently,  55  percent  of  BRI  loans  to
low-  and  middle-income  countries  are  in  their  principal  repayment
period,  a  figure  expected  to  rise  to  75  percent  by  2030.394  Recog-
nizing  that  its  risk  management  and  due  diligence  practices  were
lax  in  the  early  years  of  BRI,  China  has  taken  a  number  of  steps
to  mitigate  its  exposure  to  potential  default  on  outstanding  loans.
First,  it  has  dialed  up  RMB-denominated  emergency  rescue  lend-
ing ‡  to  borrowers  to  ensure  the  cash  reserves  necessary  to  service
debt.395  The  analysis  from  AidData  runs  through  the  end  of  2021
and finds that by that time, China had provided 128 emergency res-
cue  loans  to  22  debtor  countries  worth  a  combined  $240  billion.396
Emergency rescue loans jumped from less than 5 percent of China’s
overseas  lending  portfolio  to  low-  and  middle-income  countries  in
2010  to  nearly  60  percent  by  2022  (see  Figure  7).397  Second,  it  has
aggressively  sought  to  collateralize  loans  by  requiring  borrowers  to
maintain escrow accounts from which China can draw funds in the
event of default.398 Last, it is increasing interest rates for late pay-
ment, now set at a maximum 8.7 percent.399

* BRI lending is typically broken out into two subcategories: construction and investment. Con-
struction consists of lending often financed by Chinese state banks to build infrastructure, with a
timeline for completion and no implied ownership of the assets. Investment deals are financed by
Chinese investors to take an equity stake in an asset, portending an indefinite Chinese presence
in  the  host  country.  Christoph  Dedopil,  “China  Belt  and  Road  Initiative  (BRI)  Investment  Re-
port 2023,” Griffith University and Fudan University, February 2024, 2; Derek Scissors, “China’s
Overseas Investment Starts the Long Climb Back,” American Enterprise Institute, July 20, 2021.

Commission, Chapter 3, Section 1, “Belt and Road Initiative,” in 2018 Annual Report to Congress,
November 2018, 259–303.

‡ Emergency  rescue  loans  typically  are  provided  as  balance  of  payment  support  by  the  PBOC
to  the  central  banks  of  debtor  countries  as  a  component  of  debt  restructuring.  However,  there
has  been  a  rise  in  emergency  lending  from  Chinese  state  banks  working  with  foreign  banks  to
service  BRI  debt  in  borrower  nations.  Keith  Bradsher,  “China  Is  Lending  Billions  to  Countries
in  Financial Trouble,”  New York Times,  November  6,  2023; Alex Wooley, “Belt  and  Road  Bailout

China’s  unilateral  lending  practices  undermine  interna-
tional  efforts  to  reduce  the  debt  burden  of  low-  and  mid-
dle-income countries. An argument has been made that Beijing’s
efforts to ensure repayment undermine international efforts to alle-
viate  debt  burdens  of  low-income  countries,  such  as  the  G20  Com-
mon  Framework  for  Debt Treatments,  in  which  China  agreed  to  be
a  participant  in  2020.400  Members  of  the  Paris  Club,  a  group  of
international countries dedicated to resolving sovereign debt issues
in  a  sustainable  manner,  are  edged  out  by  guaranteed  repayment
plans that China coerces borrowers to accept, all the while increas-
ing  the  debt  obligation  under  increasingly  burdensome  terms.401
For  its  part,  the  United  States  has  stepped  up  development  assis-
tance  in  recent  years  and  worked  with  partners  and  allies  to  pro-
vide alternative options for much-needed infrastructure investment
in  low-  and  middle-income  countries  with  transparent  terms,  such
as  the  U.S.  International  Development  Finance  Corporation  (DFC)
and more recent G7 initiative Partnership for Global Infrastructure
and Investment (PGII).402 From 2014 to 2017, China’s development
financing  was  triple  that  of  the  United  States,  and  by  2021  it  ex-
ceeded the United States by only 30 percent.403

CHAPTER 2: U.S.-CHINA SECURITY AND
FOREIGN AFFAIRS (YEAR IN REVIEW)

Abstract

In  2024,  China  sought  to  mitigate  internal  and  external  risks
by  continuing  to  tighten  political  control  at  home  and  exercising  a
combination of coercive and persuasive strategies abroad. To combat
persistent  problems  of  corruption  and  fears  of  political  disloyalty,
General  Secretary  of  the  Chinese  Communist  Party  (CCP)  Xi  Jin-
ping  and  a  small  circle  of  top  leaders  tightened  their  grip  on  the
Party  rank  and  file  while  continuing  to  unseat  and  in  some  cases
disappear high-ranking figures across the government and military.
Internationally, China attempted to promote itself as the world lead-
er best positioned to solve and prevent conflicts, represent low- and
middle-income  countries,  and  promote  economic  growth  while  also
making  it  clear  that  it  opposed  U.S.  policies  and  alliance  relation-
ships. In its diplomacy with the United States, China sought to use
the  promise  of  bilateral  dialogues  on  narrow  areas  of  common  in-
terest  to  derail  what  it  perceives  as  the  United  States’  policy  of
strategic  competition.  It  sought  to  tighten  ties  with  Europe  and
encourage  divisions  within  the  transatlantic  alliance  but  continued
to  undermine  its  own  credibility  through  its  intensifying  economic,
military,  diplomatic,  and  political  support  for  Russia.  At  the  same
time, China is increasingly providing support and resources to coun-
tries  involved  in  military  operations  against  Western  allies.  China
also  turned  a  blind  eye  as  Iran  and  North  Korea  act  in  ways  that
undermine  global  stability,  and  it  has  demonstrated  willingness  to
exploit  tensions  in  the  Middle  East  for  geopolitical  gain.  Overall,
China  reacted  to  other  countries’  efforts  to  protect  their  economic
and  physical  security  by  portraying  them  as  hostile,  exclusionary,
and  destabilizing.  In  the  case  of  the  South  China  Sea,  China  re-
sorted  to  more  dangerous,  violent  actions.  Despite  the  willingness
of  some  governments  to  deepen  cooperation  with  Beijing  in  various
domains, many other countries remained deeply skeptical of China’s
intentions and proposals.

Key Findings

 • As part of its efforts to solidify its control across the Party, state,
and  military,  in  2024  the  CCP  leadership  introduced  new  mea-
sures on political discipline and anticorruption, targeting every-
one from low-ranking Party members to senior military officers.
From the top of the system, General Secretary Xi delivered dire
messages  to  Party  and  military  audiences  on  the  severity  of
remaining problems, revived some Maoist concepts and slogans,
and  emphasized  the  importance  of  political  loyalty  and  endur-
ing hardship. China’s leaders viewed enhanced domestic control

(92)

93

as a key factor in China’s ability to accomplish its domestic and
international objectives.

 • China  continues  to  assert  that  the  United  States  poses  inten-
sifying  strategic  risk.  Despite  a  bilateral  agreement  reached  in
late  2023  to  pursue  limited  cooperation  on  military  communi-
cation,  climate  change,  countering  fentanyl  and  other  drugs,
artificial  intelligence  (AI),  and  people-to-people  ties,  China  has
continued its efforts  to counter or weaken U.S.  policies  without
changing  its  own  behavior.  Fundamental  divergences  on  issues
such  as Taiwan  and  access  to  markets,  capital,  and  technology
remain.

 • In 2024, China accelerated efforts to build international support
from as many countries as possible—with a focus on the devel-
oping  nations  of  what  it  calls  the  “Global  South”—for  China’s
claims to global leadership, its continuing efforts to isolate and
subjugate  Taiwan,  and  its  desired  forms  of  economic  coopera-
tion. At  the  same  time,  Beijing  sought  to  portray  actions  taken
by  the  United  States  and  many  of  its  allies  and  partners  to
protect their own interests and established global norms as un-
dermining the prospects for peace, stability, and prosperity and
the future of collective international progress led by China. (For

 • China  and  Russia  committed  to  further  deepening  their  joint
efforts  against  the  United  States.  China  has  sustained  its  eco-
nomic,  diplomatic,  political,  and  material  support  for  Russia’s
war effort in Ukraine. China also provided satellite imagery and
dual-use  materials  that  Russia  is  using  for  the  reconstitution
of its defense industry—such as weapons components, machine
tools, and microelectronics—all while claiming to play a leading
role in advancing a political solution to the conflict. In exchange
for  such  support,  Moscow  has  reportedly  provided  submarine,
aeronautic, and missile technologies to Beijing as defense coop-
eration between the two countries continues to strengthen.
 • China  sought  to  counteract  a  deteriorating  strategic  relation-
ship  in  Europe,  using  mainly  positive  rhetoric  and  promises  of
deepened cooperation to persuade the EU and individual Euro-
pean  countries  to  distance  themselves  from  the  United  States
and  abandon  their  efforts  to  de-risk  relations  with  China.  Xi
tried  to  reframe  Europe’s  economic  dependencies  on  China  as
the  byproducts  of  a  beneficial  symbiosis,  to  downplay  political
differences,  and  to  emphasize  supposed  shared  interests  in  the
creation of a more equal international system.

 • China’s destabilizing behavior in the Indo-Pacific region contin-
ued.  China’s  naval  and  coast  guard  presence  around  the  Japa-
nese-administered  Senkaku  Islands  and  flights  near  Japanese
airspace  in  the  East  China  Sea  represented  a  significant  es-
calation  from  previous  activity.  In  the  South  China  Sea,  Chi-
na’s aggressive behavior escalated to new levels in 2024 as the
China Coast Guard (CCG) took increasingly aggressive, unsafe,
and  even  violent  measures  to  attempt  to  block  the  Philippines,

94

a  U.S.  treaty  ally,  from  exercising  its  lawful  rights  in  its  exclu-
sive economic zone (EEZ). China’s officials continued to leverage
lawfare  tactics  to  attempt  to  normalize  their  efforts  to  impose
their  will  upon  other  countries  in  the  region  through  coercive
and illegal actions, superior force, and numbers.

Introduction

This  chapter  assesses  key  developments  in  China’s  domestic  and
foreign  affairs  in  2024.  It  begins  by  examining  the  CCP’s  domestic
measures to enhance control across the Party-state bureaucracy and
the military. Next, it describes developments in China-U.S. relations.
The chapter concludes with a survey of China’s approach to foreign
affairs  around  the  world  in  2024.  The  chapter’s  findings  are  based
on  open  source  research  and  analysis,  Commission  hearings,  and
discussions with outside experts.

Xi Jinping Strengthens Party Control and Oversight
In  2024,  General  Secretary  Xi  Jinping  continued  to  tighten  his
control  over  the  Party,  state,  society,  and  military,  broadly  framing
these  efforts  as  essential  to  improve  China’s  ability  to  accomplish
its  most  important  domestic  and  international  objectives.  Xi  em-
phasized  the  importance  of  strengthening  political  discipline  and
fighting  disloyalty  while  also  making  use  of  his  signature  anticor-
ruption  campaign  to  purge  civilian  and  defense  officials  alike.  He
also  oversaw  further  restructuring  of  the  People’s  Liberation Army
(PLA) to bring additional domains of warfare under direct control of
the political leadership.

Implications of Xi’s Power for Succession and Stability
Xi’s tight hold on power and apparent disinterest in succession
planning  creates  risk  for  China’s  political  system.  At  the  CCP’s
19th Party Congress in 2017 and again at its 20th in 2022, Xi di-
verged from what had been previous political practice by not indi-
cating an intended successor as top leader of the Party.1 Experts
have assessed that although Xi’s choices to extend his own rule *
without selecting a successor may increase his own power in the
short  term,  over  the  long  term  they  increase  the  risk  that  the
regime will experience instability.2 In the continued absence of a
clear  succession  plan,†  Xi’s  unexpected  demise  or  incapacitation

* Xi’s positions as CCP general secretary and chairman of the CCP’s Central Military Commis-
sion  (CMC)  do  not  have  term  limits.  His  third  top  position  as  the  head  of  state  of  the  People’s
Republic of China (PRC) was previously limited to two terms, but under Xi’s leadership this term
limit was removed in 2018, paving the way for him to hold all three positions indefinitely. Richard
McGregor and Jude Blanchette, “After Xi: Future Scenarios for Leadership Succession in Post-Xi
Jinping Era,” Center for Strategic and International Studies, April 21, 2021, 7.

† Although there are rules on paper about the selection process for each of Xi’s top three posi-
tions, experts assess that the process of carrying out this selection would nevertheless be highly
complex  and  uncertain.  If  Xi  were  to  pass  away,  the  CCP  Charter  suggests  the  CCP  Central
Committee  would  meet  to  select  a  new  general  secretary  from  the  current  Politburo  Standing
Committee and to select a new CMC chairman, although these two leaders need not necessarily
be  the  same  person. According  to  the  PRC  Constitution,  the  role  of  head  of  state  would  pass  to
the  sitting  vice  president  of  China—who  currently  is  not  a  member  of  the  Politburo  Standing
Committee  and  thus  not  a  candidate  for  the  other  two  top  positions.  Informal  consultation  and
bargaining by Party elites would likely play an important role in determining who is ultimately
selected,  a  process  that  could  be  particularly  fraught  or  prone  to  infighting  in  the  event  of  a
sudden power vacuum. China Daily, “Brief Introduction of Han Zheng—Chinese Vice President,”

could lead to a disorderly succession.3 The delay in designating a
successor also requires any individuals seeking to be considered a
candidate in the future to continue demonstrating their loyalty to
Xi  in  the  meantime,  which  may  contribute  to  escalating  political
tension.4

CCP Promotes Greater Societal Alignment with Xi’s Vision of

National Security

This year marked the ten-year anniversary of Xi’s introduction
of the Comprehensive National Security Concept, which the CCP
sought  to  leverage  to  attune  China’s  population  to  internal  and
external threats and the importance of rallying around the Party
to  counter  them.5  The  concept,  which  when  introduced  in  2014
heralded  a  dramatic  broadening  and  elevation  of  conceptions  of
national  security  within  China’s  policy  framework,  emphasizes
that  threats  to  China  and  to  the  CCP  may  originate  from  any
direction,  that  international  and  domestic  threats  can  interact
with one another, and that coordinated, proactive efforts are thus
required to manage them.* (For more on Xi’s Comprehensive Na-
tional  Security  Concept  and  the  CCP’s  efforts  to  prepare  China
for extreme scenarios, see Chapter 7, “China’s News Measures for
Control,  Mobilization,  and  Resilience.”) The  CCP  highlighted  the
anniversary of the concept’s introduction during its annual obser-
vation  of “National  Security  Education  Day” †  to  further  promote
it  to  the  general  public,  attempting  to  use  it  to  drum  up  support
for  the  Party’s  absolute  leadership  over  all  domains.‡ 6  Some  of
the Party’s efforts also appeared deliberately targeted at increas-
ing  the  population’s  resistance  to  foreign  narratives.  For  exam-
ple,  an  article  circulated  in  Party  media  by  the  director  of  the

‡ China  Central  Television  circulated  a  large  propaganda  graphic  over  12  pages  in  length,

rized the wide range of domestic and international areas the concept applies to, and then prom-
inently  emphasized  the  importance  of  “Upholding  the  Party’s  Absolute  Leadership  of  National
Security  Work.”  The  graphic  was  circulated  in  China  Daily  under  a  title  claiming  “It  Concerns
You  and  Me!”  The  Party’s  official  mouthpiece,  the  People’s  Daily,  released  a  promotional  video
purporting  to  show  that  the  Party’s  faithfulness  to  this  concept  over  the  past  ten  years  had
had  a  profound,  positive  impact  on  every  domain  of  people’s  lives  and  every  element  of  China’s
domestic  and  international  success.  Alongside  the  video,  it  released  an  18-line  poem  painting  a
positive image of the Party’s national security practice as entirely for the people’s benefit. China

recommended that CCP cadres organize “public opinion struggles
against  the  deliberate  provocation  of  hype  and  smear  attacks  by
some  foreign  media,”  arguing  that  this  type  of  educational  event
would  help  the  public  learn  that  “the  world  is  not  peaceful”  and
strengthen  their  resistance  to  foreign  messaging.7

Amended  State  Council  Organic  Law  Formalizes  CCP

Executive Control over the State

The  year  saw  a  further  consolidation  of  the  Communist  Party’s
control  over  the  state  bureaucracy  and  a  continued  concentration
of  power  within  the  Party  into  the  hands  of  Xi  Jinping.  On  March
11,  China’s  National  People’s  Congress  (NPC)  passed  an  amend-
ment  to  the  Organic  Law  of  the  State  Council,  the  highest  organ
of  executive  power  within  China’s  government,  formally  enshrining
CCP  executive  control  over  the  body.8  Specifically,  the  revised  law
included new provisions to clarify that the State Council adheres to
Xi’s  guiding  ideology  and  “resolutely  implements  the  decisions  and
arrangements of the  CCP Central  Committee.” 9 This represents  an
additional  step  in  Xi’s  more  than  decade-long  effort  to  strengthen
the  Party’s  control  over  government  institutions  and  his  personal
control over the Party.* 10 The addition of these provisions codifies a
Party-state  relationship  that  already  exists  in  practice  due  to  pre-
vious  political  and  institutional  changes  under  Xi; †  nevertheless,
according to an explanation by the vice chairman of the NPC ahead
of  the  meeting,  clarifying  these  points  was “the  most  important  po-
litical requirement” behind the amendment.‡ 11

CCP  Emphasizes  Party  Loyalty  and  Control  through
Anticorruption Campaign and Intensified Party Discipline
China’s  leadership  undertook  new  efforts  over  the  last  year  to
enhance  Party  control  through  strengthened  measures.  Unlike  in
a  rule  of  law  system,  combatting  corruption  under  the  CCP’s  rule
by law system can often be concerned as much with ensuring Party
loyalty  and  political  control  as  with  traditional  notions  of  prevent-
ing malfeasance of public trust and resources. While corruption is a
concern in China, and the Party does view corruption as a threat to
its legitimacy under some circumstances, Xi’s large-scale and highly
institutionalized  anticorruption  campaign  continues  to  function  as
an  all-purpose  governing  tool  whose  purpose  is  to  strengthen  his
control over the Party and the Party’s control over Chinese society.12

* For more on Xi’s organizational changes to strengthen both the CCP’s leading role in China’s
decision-making  and  his  own  control  within  the  Party,  see  U.S.-China  Economic  and  Security
Review  Commission,  Chapter  1,  “CCP  Decision-Making  and  Xi  Jinping’s  Centralization  of  Au-
thority,” in 2022 Annual Report to Congress, November 2022.

† Some  observers  note  that  the  addition  of  an  article  entrenching  CCP  leadership  can  be  un-
derstood as the implementation of a 2018 constitutional provision that the Party’s leadership be
regarded as “the defining feature of Socialism with Chinese Characteristics” and of a 2019 order
by  the  CCP  Central  Committee  requiring  “the  Party’s  comprehensive  leadership”  to  be  written
into the organic laws of  China’s state institutions. Changhao Wei, “NPC  2024: Annotated Trans-
lation of the Revised State Council Organic Law,” NPC Observer, March 11, 2024.

‡ The  amendment  also  made  other  changes  to  codify  the  functions  of  various  State  Council
meetings,  specify  the  duties  of  vice  premiers  and  state  councilors,  and  formalize  other  practices
that had developed since the law’s introduction in 1982, such as the inclusion of the governor of
the People’s Bank of China as a member of the State Council. Cui Fandi, “Revised Organic Law of

Revised  CCP  Discipline  Regulations  Raise  Demands  on  Party  Rank

and File

The CCP continued to tighten political control over cadres and Par-
ty members to maintain its power and enhance its responsiveness.*
In December 2023, the CCP issued a revised version of the Regula-
tions on Disciplinary Actions of the Chinese Communist Party, which
came into effect in January 2024.13 First, the revision increased the
regulations’  emphasis  on  “political  discipline”  as  the  most  funda-
mental element of Party discipline while simultaneously expanding
the concept to include several infractions previously considered less
serious.† 14 Second, the revision increased the regulations’ emphasis
on  the  “strictness”  of  discipline  across  the  board.15  Another  note-
worthy adjustment added disciplinary provisions including potential
removal from internal Party positions for “grave” cases of “privately
reading,  browsing,  and  listening  to  newspapers,  books,  audio-visual
products, electronic reading materials, and online materials with se-
rious political problems.” 16 The CCP additionally launched a formal
education campaign, running from April to July, for Party members
at all levels to study the revised regulations.17 The campaign notice
emphasized that the Party should combat false loyalty to the Party
Central Committee.18

Xi  Warns  Party  and  Military  Leadership  to  Strengthen  Political

Loyalty while Invoking Anticorruption

Xi  called  upon  China’s  civilian  leadership  to  adhere  to  the  de-
mands  of  his  politically  motivated  anticorruption  campaign.‡  In
January  2024,  Xi  gave  a  speech  to  the  CCP’s  Central  Commission
for Discipline Inspection (CCDI) on what he called Party “self-revo-
lution,”  a  term  he  has  promoted  since  at  least  2016  to  describe  the
CCP’s responsibility to self-govern, self-regulate, and adapt itself to
the  demands  of  the  times.19 According  to Arran  Hope,  editor  of  the
Jamestown Foundation China Brief, the phrase is one Xi has “re-
suscitated  from  the  Mao  era,”  representing  “spiritually  puritanical
self-discipline  [that]  must  perpetually  underpin  the  conduct  of  all
cadres.” 20 Xi’s speech and the other CCP materials that expounded
upon  the  term  made  clear  that  it  would  include  expanded  anticor-
ruption  measures  while  simultaneously  emphasizing  political  loy-
alty,  political  discipline,  and  adherence  to  Xi’s  directives.21  These
materials indicated that “power-concentrated, capital-intensive, and

* As  of  December  2023,  there  were  approximately  99  million  Party  members  in  China,  repre-
senting  about  7  percent  of  China’s  population.  Xinhua,  “Chinese  Communist  Party  Statistical

† The  CCP’s  discipline  regulations  differentiate  between  “political  discipline,”  “organizational
discipline,”  “integrity  discipline,”  “mass  discipline,”  “work  discipline,”  and  “life  discipline,”  which
they  list  in  this  order.  Chinese  Communist  Party,  “Regulations  on  Disciplinary  Actions  of  the

‡ In  March  2024,  Xi  made  a  proactive  attempt  to  influence  the  political  mindset  of  young
officials,  warning  in  a  speech  at  the  CCP’s  Central  Party  School  that  young  officials  must  be
prepared  to  bear  particularly  “heavy  responsibilities”  in  practicing  political  loyalty  and  Party
discipline.  Xinhua, “Xi  Urges Young  Officials  to Take  on  Historical Task  on  New  Journey,”  State

resource-rich fields” such as finance, state-owned enterprises (SOEs),
energy,  medicine,  and  infrastructure  would  be  particular  targets  in
upcoming purges.22

Xi delivered similar messages to the top military leadership in
June  2024.  Between  June  17  and  19,  2024,  Xi  hosted  a  military
political  work  conference  for  leaders  from  the  Central  Military
Commission  (CMC)  in Yan’an,  a  city  celebrated  as  the  birthplace
of the CCP revolution, where—according to reports of his speech—
he  emphasized  that  military  power  must  always  remain  “in  the
hands  of  those  who  are  loyal  and  dependable  to  the  Party.” 23  Xi
contextualized  his  remarks  by  warning  that  China’s  military  “is
facing intricate and complex tests in politics” that will have bear-
ing on its performance in a time of great change for the military,
the  Party,  the  country,  and  the  world  at  large.24  He  claimed  the
continued  existence  of “deep-seated  contradictions  and  problems”
in  the  areas  of “politics,  ideology,  organization,  style,  [and]  disci-
pline”  and  argued  that  their  “roots  lie  in  ideals  and  beliefs,  Par-
ty  spirit  cultivation,  official  ethics,  and  character.” 25  Raising  the
specter of his anticorruption campaign, Xi also reportedly warned
that  “there  are  no  hiding  places  for  any  corrupt  elements  in  the
military”  and  repeated  similar  messages  as  those  covered  in  his
speech to the civilian CCP Central Discipline Inspection Commis-
sion  in  January  2024.26

Military and Civilian Leaders Fall to Xi’s Anticorruption Campaign
The  CCP  continued  to  intensify  ongoing  purges  of  military  and
defense  leaders,  especially  those  with  influence  over  the  country’s
nuclear and missile arsenals and other advanced equipment. Follow-
ing the removal of several PLA Rocket Force leaders purged during
the  summer  and  fall  of  2023,*  similar  events  continued  to  rock
the  PLA  leadership  through  late  2023  and  the  first  half  of  2024.27
In  December  2023,  the  NPC  Standing  Committee  announced  the
expulsion  of  nine  military  representatives  from  their  positions  on
the NPC.28 Four of these nine leaders were affiliated with the PLA
Rocket  Force,  two  with  the  CMC  Equipment  Development  Depart-
ment, and one each from the CMC Joint Staff Department, the PLA
Air  Force,  and  the  PLA  Navy.29  Although  no  explanation  was  pro-
vided  for  the  dismissals  at  the  time,  the  body  stated  in  mid-Janu-
ary  2024  that  they  were  attributable  to  “serious  violations  of  law
and  discipline.” 30 Also  in  December  2023,  China’s  People’s  Political
Consultative  Conference  removed  three  leaders  from  top  defense
industry  firms,  including  the  chairman  of  the  China Aerospace  Sci-
ence  and  Technology  Corporation,  which  oversees  the  development
of China’s spacecraft and missile programs; the chairman of Norinco
Group,  a  leading  military  equipment  manufacturer;  and  the  depu-
ty  manager  of  state-owned  China  Aerospace  Science  and  Industry
Corporation.31 On June 27, 2024, the Politburo announced that Chi-
na’s previous two ministers of national defense, Li Shangfu and Wei
Fenghe,  had  both  been  investigated  for  corruption,  found  guilty  of
several serious violations related to corruption and Party discipline,

ty and Foreign Affairs,” in 2023 Annual Report to Congress, November 2023.

and  expelled  from  the  Party.* 32  The  revolving  door  of  leadership
created  by  Xi’s  purges  could  potentially  impact  PLA  readiness,  and
the heavy representation of the PLA Rocket Force—which manages
China’s  missile  arsenal,  including  nuclear  missiles—and  the  CMC
Equipment Development Department among purged officials makes
this  risk  particularly  salient  for  China’s  strategic  nuclear  and  mis-
sile forces.33

A wide range of civilian officials were also investigated and dis-
ciplined throughout 2024, including central and local officials and
leaders from the sectors Xi identified in his January 2024 speech
to  the  CCDI.  For  example,  a  large  number  of  state  regulators,
bankers, and senior financial executives were detained in the first
five  months  of  2024  for  ostensibly  corruption-related  charges.34
In  July  and  August  2024,  several  local  officials,  an  official  from
China’s  Ministry  of  Emergency  Management,  and  at  least  three
officials from transportation SOEs were placed under disciplinary
investigation.35  In  other  cases,  officials  who  had  previously  been
expelled from the Party were later indicted, tried, or sentenced to
life  in  prison  for  bribery  or  embezzlement.36  (For  additional  de-
tails  on  anticorruption  and  discipline  inspection  cases  involving
civilian  officials,  see  Chapter  7, “China’s  New  Measures  for  Con-
trol,  Mobilization,  and  Resilience.”)  Also  in  July  2024,  the  CCP
Central  Committee  announced  that  it  had  accepted  the “resigna-
tion”  of  Qin  Gang,  a  high-ranking  official  and  then  Central  Com-
mittee member who had been stripped of his government posts in
2023 amid reports that he had engaged in an extramarital affair
in  the  United  States.† 37

China Elevates New Warfighting Domains under the CMC

In  April  2024,  the  PLA  announced  a  major  reorganization  that
elevated the importance of space, cyber, and information capabilities
and placed all three under the more direct control of the top leader-
ship. The announcement came as a surprise to PLA experts outside
of China and could have been undertaken for a variety of operation-
al or political reasons.38 The reorganization included disbanding the
PLA  Strategic  Support  Force—which  had  previously  held  responsi-
bility  for  space,  cyber,  and  information  domains—and  restructuring

* Former  Minister  Li,  who  had  spent  decades  of  his  career  in  the  equipment  department  that
overseas military procurement, was criticized for “seriously pollut[ing] the political ecology of the
military  equipment  field  and  the  atmosphere  of  the  industrial  domain”  through  his  corruption,
while former Minister Wei was accused of seriously polluting the force in general. The announce-
ments also included discussion of political loyalty, with Li accused of having “lost his Party spirit
and  principles”  and  a  statement  that Wei’s “faith  [had]  collapsed  and  his  loyalty  was  lost.”  Both
leaders  were  criticized  for  having  “caused  great  damage  to  the  Party’s  cause,  national  defense
and military construction, as well as the image of senior leaders” through their actions. Jun Mai

berspace  Force,  and  the  Information  Support  Force.39  Prior  to  the
reorganization,  the  Strategic  Support  Force  was  commanded  at  the
theater  grade  level *  directly  under  the  CMC,  while  its  component
parts  responsible  for  space,  cyber,  and  information  operations  were
commanded at lower levels.40 As  a result of the reorganization, the
three new forces are now each directly subordinate to the CMC and
are  commanded  at  the  deputy  theater  grade  level,†  similar  to  the
PLA  Joint  Logistics  Support  Force.41  The  change  also  established
a  new  distinction  between  four  PLA  “services”—the  PLA  Army,
Navy,  Air  Force,  and  Rocket  Force—which  are  organized  mainly
around the traditional domains of land, sea, and air—and four PLA
“arms”—the  PLA  Military  Aerospace  Force,  Cyberspace  Force,  In-
formation Support Force, and Joint Logistics Support Force—whose
operations  support  military  activities  across  traditional  domains.42
Joel  Wuthnow,  senior  research  fellow  at  the  U.S.  National  Defense
University, assesses that the new structure would “help break down
silos  in  the  PLA  and  improve  the  functioning  of  the  joint  opera-
tions  systems”  because  theater  commanders  would  now  be  able  to
more easily tap into the support forces’ assets without the complica-
tion of dealing with higher headquarters (which was the case when
such assets were consolidated under the co-equal Strategic Support
Force).43  (For  an  overview  of  the  structural  changes,  see  Figure  1
below.)  The  Information  Support  Force  is  likely  to  handle  network
information  system,  communications  support,  and  network  defense
tasks.‡ 44  (For  more  on  the  PLA’s  views  on  the  importance  of  infor-
mation  in  warfare,  see  Chapter  8, “China’s  Evolving  Counter-Inter-
vention Capabilities and the Role of Indo-Pacific Allies.”)

* Officers at the theater command grade typically hold the rank of general or lieutenant gener-
al. A Theater Command leader’s rank is a three-star flag officer equivalent to a U.S. four-star flag
officer.  Ken Allen,  Independent  Consultant,  China  Military Analyst,  interview  with  Commission

Professionalization,” Jamestown Foundation, March 15, 2021.

† Officers  at  the  deputy  theater  command  grade  typically  hold  the  rank  of  lieutenant  general
or major general. A Deputy Theater Command Leader’s rank is a two-star or one-star flag officer
equivalent  to  a  U.S.  three-star  or  two-star  flag  officer  respectively.  Ken Allen,  Independent  Con-

‡ In a speech at the ceremony establishing the Information Support Force, Xi said the new arm
that would strengthen the PLA has an “important position and heavy responsibility” in promoting
the  development  of  the  PLA  and  supporting  the  PLA’s  efforts  to  “wi[n]  modern  wars.”  An  April
commentary published in the PLA Daily claimed the Information Support Force would “improve
[China’s]  army’s  joint  combat  capabilities  and  all-domain  combat  capabilities,”  help  achieve  the
PLA’s centenary goal, and facilitate its transformation into a world-class military. According to J.
Michael  Dahm,  senior  resident  fellow  for Aerospace  and  China  Studies  at  the  Mitchell  Institute
for Aerospace Studies, “Empowering the new deputy theater-grade Information Support Force to
strengthen  and  harden  information  network  capabilities  may  be  the  PLA’s  response  to  similar

China Seeks One-Sided Adjustments in Its Relations

with the United States

Relatively civil language and modest promises at the beginning of
this year reflected a shared desire by the governments of the United
States  and  China  to  mitigate  the  recent  deterioration  in  relations
through  increased  dialogue  and  cooperation.  Nevertheless,  while
the  United  States  sought  incrementalism  to  improve  communica-
tion  and  strengthen  cooperation  in  areas  of  mutual  interest  amid
the  continued  reality  of  strategic  competition,  China  called  for  the
United  States  to  cease  viewing  it  as  a  competitor  and  refused  to
take  responsibility  for  the  harmful  impacts  of  its  own  actions.  By
mid-2024, China’s statements and actions with respect to the Philip-
pines in the South China Sea, Taiwan, and Japan, for example, also
showed  that  Beijing  remains  willing  to  pursue  dangerous  levels  of
escalation on certain policy issues.

Differing Positions Challenge U.S.-China High-Level Dialogue

and Narrow Cooperation Initiatives

In  2024,  the  United  States  and  China  increased  high-level  dip-
lomatic  engagements  and  pursued  certain  narrow  cooperation  ob-
jectives,  but  differing  views  and  underlying  objectives  continued  to
surface. In a bilateral summit meeting in November 2023, President
Joe Biden and General Secretary Xi discussed a range of issues and
agreed to limited cooperation amid ongoing strategic competition.47
These  areas  included  military  communication,  countering  fentanyl
and  other  drugs, AI,  climate  change,  and  people-to-people  exchang-
es.* 48 Xi and Biden held a follow-up conversation by phone in April,
2024.49 Additional meetings between high-level leaders at the secre-
tary and minister level aimed to continue the dialogue and push for
progress  in  these  and  other  areas,  with  U.S.  Secretary  of  the Trea-
sury  Janet  L. Yellen  and  U.S.  Secretary  of  State Antony  J.  Blinken
meeting  counterparts  in  China  in April  2024  and  U.S.  Secretary  of
Defense Lloyd Austin meeting China’s Minister of National Defense
Admiral  Dong  Jun  on  the  sidelines  of  the  Shangri-La  Dialogue  in
Singapore  in  May  2024.50  In  addition,  U.S.  Secretary  of  Commerce
Gina  Raimondo  held  a  call  with  China’s  Minister  of  Commerce
Wang  Wentao  in  January  2024  to  press  for  the  inaugural  meeting
of  the  U.S.-China  Commercial  Issues Working  Group.51  On April  4,
2024, the U.S. Under Secretary of Commerce for International Trade
Marisa Lago and China’s Vice Minister of  Commerce Wang Shouw-
en held the first meeting of the Commercial Issues Working Group,
where  the  U.S.  side  addressed  concern  for  cross-border  data  flows,
regulatory transparency, and the growing overcapacity in a range of
Chinese industrial sectors.52 Nevertheless, visible progress in these
areas  remains  limited  and  in  some  areas  progress  continues  to  be
challenged by countervailing trends:

* In addition to these agreements, the two leaders agreed their teams would follow up on their
discussions  in  San  Francisco  with  continued  high-level  diplomacy  and  interactions,  including
visits in both directions and ongoing working-level consultations in key areas, including on com-
mercial,  economic,  financial,  Asia  Pacific,  arms  control  and  nonproliferation,  maritime,  export
control  enforcement,  policy  planning,  agriculture,  and  disability  issues.  White  House,  Readout

 • Military  communication:  In  November  2023,  President  Biden
and General Secretary Xi agreed to the resumption of high-lev-
el  military-to-military  communication  as  well  as  the  U.S.-Chi-
na  Defense  Policy  Coordination  Talks,  the  U.S.-China  Military
Maritime  Consultative  Agreement  meetings,  and  telephone
conversations between theater commanders.* 53 The subsequent
meeting  between  Secretary  Austin  and  Minister  Dong  on  the
sidelines  of  the  Shangri-La  Dialogue  in  May  2024,  although
limited  in  scope,  did  mark  a  contrast  with  the  previous  year
in  which  China’s  then  Minister  of  National  Defense  Li  Shang-
fu  had  refused  a  U.S.  offer  to  speak  and  reportedly  dismissed
even  the  offer  of  a  handshake.† 54  After  years  of  China  ignor-
ing  requests  to  open  channels  of  communication  between  com-
manders,  on  September  9,  2024,  U.S.  Indo-Pacific  Commander
Admiral  Samuel  Paparo  held  a  video  teleconference  with  the
PLA’s  Southern  Theater  Commander  General  Wu  Yanan.55  In
the  meeting  Admiral  Paparo  urged  the  PLA  to  reconsider  its
“dangerous,  coercive,  and  potentially  escalatory  tactics”  in  the
South  China  Sea  and  expressed  interest  in  continued  dialogue
with  other  PLA  theater  commands.‡ 56  Between  September  14
and  15,  2024,  U.S.  Deputy  Assistant  Secretary  of  Defense  for
China,  Taiwan,  and  Mongolia  Michael  Chase  met  with  Deputy
Director  of  the  CMC  Office  for  International  Military  Coopera-
tion Major General Ye Jiang in Beijing for the  18th  U.S.-China
Defense Policy Coordination Talks.57 Dr. Chase raised concerns
with  China’s  support  for  Russia’s  defense  industrial  base  and
underscored  U.S.  commitment  to  its  allies  and  partners  in  the
Indo-Pacific in light of China’s destabilizing actions against law-
ful Philippine operations.58

 • Countering  fentanyl  and  other  drugs:  China  is  one  of  the  ma-
jor  sources  of  the  precursor  chemicals  used  to  produce  fentan-
yl,  which  took  the  lives  of  over  74,000  Americans  in  2023.59
In  November  2023,  President  Biden  and  General  Secretary  Xi
agreed to the resumption of bilateral cooperation to combat the
global  illicit  drug  trade,  including  fentanyl,  and  to  the  estab-
lishment  of  a  working  group  for  ongoing  communication  and
law  enforcement  coordination  on  issues  related  to  countering

to  then-Speaker  of  the  House  Nancy  Pelosi’s  visit  to  Taiwan.  Reuters,  “China  Halts  High-Level
Military Dialogue with U.S., Suspends Other Cooperation,” August 5, 2022.

† Nevertheless, in response to a question about the potential upcoming meeting the day before
the  event,  China’s  Ministry  of  National  Defense  spokesperson  stated  that  although  China  felt
increased communication was important, it also viewed the U.S. side as “the fundamental reason
for  the  ups  and  downs  in  the  relationship  between  the  two  militaries”  and  accused  the  United
States of “artificially creat[ing] risks of confrontation.” These claims ignore the longstanding U.S.
efforts  to  establish  better  communications  with  the  PLA  and  the  PLA’s  own  tactic  of  restricting
communication  access  in  order  to  punish  the  United  States  for  actions  it  disagrees  with.  Chi-

fentanyl and other drugs.60 Also in November 2023, the United
States removed sanctions on China’s Ministry of Public Securi-
ty’s Institute of Forensic Science,* likely in a bid to elicit further
cooperation from Beijing to stem the flow of fentanyl precursor
chemicals.61  On  January  30,  2024,  the  United  States  and  Chi-
na  launched  the  Counternarcotics Working  Group  under  which
Deputy  Assistant  to  the  President  and  Deputy  Homeland  Se-
curity  Advisor  Jen  Daskal  led  a  U.S.  interagency  delegation  to
Beijing to coordinate efforts to counter the global manufacturing
of illicit synthetic drugs, including fentanyl.62 During Secretary
Yellen’s visit to China in April 2024, the two sides launched an
exchange  to  increase  cooperation  in  combating  money  launder-
ing  associated  with  drug  trafficking.63  In August  2024,  China’s
Ministry  of  Public  Security  announced  stricter  oversight  over
the  production  and  sale  of  three  chemicals  commonly  used  to
make  fentanyl,  ostensibly  as  a  result  of  the  U.S.  decision  to  re-
move sanctions in November 2023 and progress made in subse-
quent working groups.† 64 Serious concerns nevertheless remain
that  progress  on  reducing  the  flow  of  fentanyl  precursors  into
the United States from China so far has been limited.65

 • Artificial  intelligence:  In  November  2023,  President  Biden  and
General  Secretary  Xi  affirmed  the  need  to  address  the  risks  of
advanced AI systems and improve AI safety through U.S.-China
government  talks.66  On  May  14,  2024,  interagency  delegations
from the United States and China met in Geneva, Switzerland,
to discuss AI risk and safety.67 The meeting included discussion
of  issues  of  common  concern  but  also  highlighted  areas  of  re-
maining  difference,  including  on  matters  related  to  the  use  of
AI by China’s government.68 (For more on China’s development
and use of AI technologies, see Chapter 3, “U.S.-China Competi-
tion in Emerging Technologies.”)

 • People-to-people exchanges: In November 2023, President Biden
and  General  Secretary  Xi  committed  to  work  toward  a  further
increase  in  scheduled  passenger  flights  in  2024—in  parallel
with  actions  to  restore  full  implementation  of  the  U.S.-China
air  transportation  agreement—to  support  exchanges  between
the  two  countries.69  They  also  encouraged  the  expansion  of

* On  May  22,  2020,  the  U.S.  Department  of  Commerce  placed  China’s  Ministry  of  Public  Se-
curity’s  Institute  of  Forensic  Science,  as  well  as  eight  other  Chinese  entities,  on  the  Entity  List
for  being  “complicit  in  human  rights  violations  and  abuses  committed  in  China’s  campaign  of
repression,  mass  arbitrary  detention,  forced  labor  and  high-technology  surveillance  against  Ui-
ghurs,  ethnic  Kazakhs,  and  other  members  of  Muslim  minority  groups  in  the  Xinjiang  Uighur

† The United States and China are only now beginning to resume the dialogue on this critical
issue that China’s leadership suspended in retaliation after then Speaker Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan
in 2022. China first agreed to cooperate with the United States on tackling the spread of fentanyl
in 2019. Chinese officials claim the responsibility for the fentanyl crisis stems from U.S. failures
to  prevent  and  treat  drug  addiction,  rather  than  Chinese  precursor  regulations.  Brian  Spegele,

educational,  student,  youth,  cultural,  sports,  and  business  ex-
changes.70  In  the  first  half  of  2024,  China’s  Party-state  media
and  speeches  by  China’s  diplomatic  officials  to  U.S.  audiences
portrayed deepening people-to-people exchanges as a necessary
component  of “stable  development  of  U.S.-China  relations”  and
an  area  of  overwhelming  opportunity  for  both  sides.71  Never-
theless,  evidence  suggests  that  even  during  that  time,  China’s
government  was  pursuing  a  more  one-sided  set  of  exchanges
by  restricting  access  to  its  own  society.  In  June  2024,  U.S. Am-
bassador  to  China  Nicholas  Burns  stated  in  an  interview  that
China’s  government  has  been  actively  working  to  undermine
people-to-people  ties  within  China  by  interrogating  and  intimi-
dating citizens who attended or sought to attend U.S.-organized
events in China * and by increasing restrictions on the U.S. Em-
bassy’s social media posts.72 As he stated in his remarks, “They
say  they’re  in  favor  of  reconnecting  our  two  populations,  but
they’re  taking  dramatic  steps  to  make  it  impossible.” 73  Rather
than  addressing  the  allegations,  a  spokesperson  from  China’s
Ministry  of  Foreign Affairs  rejected  them  outright  and  insisted
that  Ambassador  Burns’  remarks  “deviate  from  the  important
consensus reached by the two leaders” and “are not in line with
the proper way for China and the U.S. to coexist.” 74

Strategic Disputes Continue to Shape U.S.-China Relations

Despite  efforts  to  enhance  dialogue  and  explore  possibilities  for
cooperation,  deep  strategic  disputes  continued  to  play  a  dominant
role in defining the tenor of U.S.-China interactions. This trend was
apparent  from  the  time  of  the  November  2023  summit  itself.  Chi-
na’s  Ministry  of  Foreign Affairs  readout  stated  the  summit “should
be  a  new  starting  point  for  stabilizing  China-U.S.  relations”  while
also including language strongly suggesting a belief that the United
States was predisposed to “cling to the zero-sum mentality, provoke
rivalry  and  confrontation,  and  drive  the  world  toward  turmoil  and
division.” 75  After  the  summit,  China’s  official  media  continued  to
portray the meeting as a stabilizer of an otherwise plummeting rela-
tionship while placing all of the blame for its necessity on the Unit-
ed States.76 In the two leaders’ April 2024 phone call, Xi stated that
although the relationship was “beginning to stabilize,” “negative fac-
tors”  had  also  been  “growing,”  and  he  criticized  the  United  States
for  not  changing  its  longstanding  policy  positions  on  key  issues.77
Throughout 2024, China’s leaders, diplomats, and Party-state media
used  the  language  of  the  November  2023  meeting  to  criticize  sig-
nificant  U.S.  policy  positions  and  encourage  or  demand  alternative
policies that would benefit China:

 • Strategic Perceptions: China’s leadership insisted that the Unit-
ed  States  should  change  its  strategic  assessment  of  China  and
cease  treating  it  as  a  competitor. The  readout  of  the  November
2023  meeting  from  China’s  Ministry  of  Foreign  Affairs  listed
“five  pillars”  China  wishes  the  U.S.-China  relationship  to  re-

* At the time of the interview, Ambassador Burns reported that since the previous November he
had  counted  61  public  events  for  which  China’s  Ministry  of  State  Security  or  other  government
bodies  had  pressured  Chinese  citizens  not  to  attend  or  had  attempted  to  intimidate  those  who
attended.  Jonathan  Cheng,  “In  Rare  Rebuke,  U.S.  Ambassador  Accuses  China  of  Undermining
Diplomacy,” Wall Street Journal, June 25, 2024.

flect,  with  the  first  being  “developing  a  right  perception.” 78  In
his remarks at a dinner in San Francisco during this same trip,
Xi  elaborated  on  this  position  by  insisting  that “to  regard  Chi-
na,  which  insists  on  peaceful  development,  as  a  threat  and  to
engage  in  zero-sum  game . . .  is  to  go  in  the  wrong  direction.” 79
In November 2023 and January 2024, respectively, both Xi and
Liu  Jianchao,  head  of  the  CCP’s  International  Liaison  Depart-
ment,  claimed  that  China  “has  no  intention”  of  “challenging”
or  “replacing”  the  United  States,  with  the  latter  adding  that
China  also  “does  not  seek  to  change  the  current  international
order.” 80  Some  Party-state  media  commentaries  adopted  a  less
diplomatic  approach,  arguing  forcefully  that  the  United  States’
“wrong”  perception  of  China  inspires  it  to  pursue  containment
and  will  bring  only  a  negative  future  for  the  relationship.* 81
China’s approach ignores the differing interests and values un-
derpinning U.S. policy and China’s own longstanding pursuit of
strategic  competition  with  the  United  States.82  It  also  ignores
Xi’s detailed efforts to reshape the international order to better
suit China’s interests.83

 • Taiwan: Efforts to increase dialogue did not result in any change
to  China  and  the  United  States’  differing  positions  on Taiwan.
According to China’s readout of the November 2023 meeting, Xi
called Taiwan “the  most  important  and  most  sensitive  issue  in
China-U.S.  relations”  and  stated  that  the  United  States  should
support unification between the two sides, meaning on Beijing’s
terms.84 Chinese state media summaries discussing the impact
of the November 2023 summit on U.S.-China relations also con-
tinued  to  invoke  Taiwan  as  a  serious  issue  that  remained  un-
addressed from Beijing’s perspective.85 In his April 2024 phone
call with President Biden, General Secretary Xi labeled Taiwan
as  “the  first  red  line  that  must  not  be  crossed  in  China-U.S.
relations”  and  warned  that  “China  is  not  going  to  sit  on  its
hands”  if  the  United  States  continued  what  it  argued  amount-
ed  to  supporting Taiwan  independence.86  Secretary Austin  met
with  Minister  Dong  on  May  31,  2024,  following  the  inaugura-
tion  of  Taiwan’s  President  Lai  Tsing-te,  where  Minister  Dong
intensified China’s rhetoric regarding U.S.-Taiwan relations and
called on the United States to “correct its errors” and to refrain
from  “aiding  independence  by  force.” 87  In  a  demonstration  of
its resolve not to compromise, on July 17, 2024, China declared

* For  example,  a  China  Daily  editorial  in  January  2024  accused  the  United  States  of  trying
“every  means  to  contain  China’s  rise  and  development”  because  it  holds  a “wrong  perception  of
China,” classifying China as a “major competitor” and even viewing China as a “threat.” For the
sake of building a “stable and sustainable” relationship, it then exhorted the United States to “es-
tablish a correct perception of China [and] avoid misjudgments.” A Xinhua commentary in March
attributed  strained  relations  in  recent  years  primarily  to  an  incorrect  “strategic  perception”  of
China by some in the United States and argued that correcting these strategic perceptions must
be the issue of first importance between them. More explicitly, it described the elimination of the
United States’ “seriously erroneous perception of China” as a “prerequisite” for the two countries’
positive mutual coexistence, and it warned that continuing to view China as a competitor would
lead to increased “confrontation” and even a “new Cold War.” China Daily, “He Pingli: Strengthen

U.S.” 88 (For more on China’s actions related to Taiwan in 2024,

 • Trade,  science,  and  technology:  In  November  2023,  Xi  framed
U.S.  export  controls,  investment  screening,  and  sanctions  as  a
key  concern  for  China  and  an  effort  to  “deprive  the  Chinese
people  of  their  right  to  development,”  completely  ignoring  ex-
pressed  concerns  about  China’s  unfair  economic  practices,  pu-
nitive  actions  against  U.S.  firms,  and  the  use  of  U.S.  technolo-
gies to endanger U.S. national security.89 China’s readout of the
leaders’  April  2024  phone  call  repeated  this  framing,  accused
the  United  States  of “creating  risks,”  and  declared  that “China
is not going to sit back and watch.” 90 China’s state-backed me-
dia  and  diplomats  speaking  to  audiences  in  the  United  States
also pressed for the reversal of U.S. trade, science, and technol-
ogy  restrictions  on  China—especially  the “small  yard  and  high
fence”  concept  and  efforts  to  counteract  negative  impacts  of
China’s  overcapacity—framing  them  as “strategic  containment”
and “overstretching the concept of national security” without ac-
knowledging the role of China’s own behavior in bringing them
about or China’s own increasingly broad concept of national se-
curity.91  (For  more  on  science  and  technology,  see  Chapter  3,
“U.S.  China  Competition  in  Emerging  Technologies.”  For  more
on  economic  competition,  see  Chapter  6,  “Key  Economic  Strat-
egies  for  Leveling  the  U.S.-China  Playing  Field.”  For  more  on

Control, Mobilization, and Resilience.”)

 • South China Sea: China’s longstanding and aggressive behavior
in  the  South  China  Sea  became  an  increasingly  salient  issue
throughout  the  year  as  China  took  escalatory  actions  that  con-
travened international law and threatened the security of a U.S.
treaty  ally.  Although  disagreements  over  the  South  China  Sea
were not mentioned as a key issue in the November 2023 sum-
mit  meeting,  they  did  feature  as  negative  examples  in  China’s
state  media  summaries  of  U.S-China  relations  in  January  and
February  2024.92  Xi  also  reportedly  raised  China’s  position  on
the South China Sea in the phone call between the two leaders
in April 2024.93 China continuously escalated its actions against
Philippine vessels throughout the spring and early summer, re-
peatedly  threatening  their  security  and  personnel  and  edging
dangerously  close  to  a  threshold  of  violence  that  could  trigger
U.S.  defense  commitments  to  the  Philippines  under  the  allies’
mutual  defense  treaty.*  (For  more  on  China’s  harassment  of
and  violence  toward  the  Philippines  in  the  South  China  Sea,

Risks to U.S. Critical Infrastructure from China
The  United  States  and  allied  countries  increased  their  atten-
tion  to  countering  China’s  threats  to  critical  infrastructure.*  In
February  2024,  the  U.S.  Cybersecurity  and  Infrastructure  Se-
curity  Agency  (CISA)  released  a  joint  risk  advisory  with  three
other  U.S.  government  agencies  and  the  national  cybersecurity
centers of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United King-
dom (UK), providing new information about the 2023 cyberattack
on  U.S.  critical  infrastructure  by  the  Chinese  state-sponsored
cyber  group  Volt  Typhoon.† 95  In  March  2024,  the  U.S.  Depart-
ment  of  the  Treasury  announced  the  imposition  of  sanctions  on
a China-based Ministry of State Security front company that has
served  as  cover  for  multiple  malicious  cyber  operations  against
U.S.  critical  infrastructure.96  Speaking  at  the  Vanderbilt  Sum-
mit on Modern Conflict and Emerging Threats in Nashville, Ten-
nessee,  on  April  18,  2024,  Director  of  the  U.S.  Federal  Bureau
of  Investigation  Christopher Wray  raised  concerns  about  China’s
targeting  of  U.S.  critical  infrastructure,  which  he  described  as
“both broad and unrelenting.” 97 He placed a particular emphasis
on  China’s  use  of  cyberattacks  to  “pre-position”  capabilities  that
could be exploited in a conflict scenario.98 On April 30, 2024, the
U.S. government released a National Security Memorandum from
the leadership of a wide range of executive branch agencies, which
acknowledged  that  the  United  States  “faces  an  era  of  strategic
competition with nation-state actors who target American critical
infrastructure  and  tolerate  or  enable  malicious  actions  conduct-
ed  by  non-state  actors.” 99  The  memorandum  reflected  an  inter-
departmental  effort  to  define  policy  principles  and  objectives  for
protecting U.S. critical infrastructure, assign associated roles and
responsibilities within the U.S. Federal Government, and develop
a common risk assessment framework.‡ 100 On June 20, 2024, the

nation that their incapacity or destruction would have a debilitating impact on national security,
national economic security, or national public health or safety. China has become a global leader
in using technologies and applications to improve infrastructure and government services under
“smart cities” initiatives, designed to combine “embedded sensors, metering devices, cameras, and
other  monitoring  technologies  with  big  data  processing  and  artificial  intelligence  (AI)  analyses”
to  manage  city  infrastructure  and  public  spaces.  White  House,  National  Security  Memorandum

paign  to  develop  capabilities  that  could  disrupt  critical  communications  infrastructure  between
the United States and the Indo-Pacific region during future crises. Volt Typhoon has been active
since mid-2021 and targeted critical infrastructure organizations in Guam and the United States,

China’s  Foreign  Policy  Aims  to  Temper  Risk  and

Expand Opportunities

In  2024,  China  stepped  up  its  ongoing  efforts  to  build  interna-
tional support for its own leadership and to prevent other countries
from  pursuing  policies  harmful  to  its  interests.  With  a  particular
emphasis  on  the  low-  and  middle-income  countries  of  what  China
now  calls  the “Global  South,”  officials  from  across  the  Party-state’s
foreign  policy  apparatus—from  Ministry  of  Foreign  Affairs  diplo-
mats  and  CCP  International  Liaison  Department  officials ‡  to  PLA
representatives  conducting  military  diplomacy §—promoted  China’s
supposedly beneficial global leadership in opposition to what it por-
trayed  as  the  harmful  international  actions  of  the  United  States
and  its  allies.  In  its  diplomatic  engagements,  China  highlighted
self-declared  contributions  to  solving  global  challenges,  even  in  ar-
eas  where  its  interlocutors  did  not  share  the  same  view  of  China’s
actions. China’s overtures appeared to find willing cooperation from

facilities;  healthcare  and  public  health;  information  technology;  nuclear  reactors,  materials,  and
waste; transportation systems; and water and wastewater systems. White House, National Secu-

China’s Diplomacy Adopts the Term “Global South”
China has long pursued ties with low- and middle-income coun-
tries  in  Africa,  Latin  America  and  the  Caribbean,  the  Middle
East, and parts of Asia to advance its political agenda, secure eco-
nomic  benefits,  push  for  greater  influence  in  global  governance,
and counter the strength of U.S. alliances and diplomatic partner-
ships.103  China  has  pursued  these  ties  through  bilateral  agree-
ments,  multilateral  groupings  such  as  the  intergovernmental
organization  BRICS  (Brazil,  Russia,  India,  China,  South  Africa),
and  China-led  regional  fora  such  as  the  Forum  for  China-Africa
Cooperation  (FOCAC),  China-Community  of  Latin American  and
Caribbean  States  (China-CELAC)  Cooperation,  and  China-Arab
States  Cooperation  Forum  (CASCF).104  Expanding  such  ties  has
served as a focus of China’s global foreign policy campaigns such
as the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and Xi’s three global initia-
tives—the  Global  Development  Initiative,  Global  Security  Initia-
tive, and Global Civilization Initiative.105

China’s  leadership  has  recently  embraced  the  term  “Global
South” * as a rhetorical tool in its longstanding diplomatic efforts
to further these relationships and use them in strategic competi-
tion  against  the  United  States.  In  the  latter  half  of  2023  and  in
2024,  Chinese  official †  and  academic  sources  increasingly  began
to replace or supplement the term “developing countries” with the
term “Global South” in discussions of China’s diplomacy with the
relevant  countries.106  By  2024,  China’s  officials  and  Party-state
media  had  thoroughly  incorporated  the  term  into  pre-existing
discourse  about  its  foreign  policy,  attempting  to  use  this  affilia-
tion  to  convince  other  countries  to  side  with  it  against  the  Unit-
ed  States.107  For  example,  China’s  longstanding  assertion  that
it—unlike the United States—shares the values and objectives of
“developing countries” because it itself is a “developing country” ‡
are now supplemented or replaced with assertions that it does so
because it is a “member” of the “Global South.” § 108

* The term “Global South” is thought to have emerged in academic analysis in 1969 as a rough
equivalent to the concept of the “Third World.” It gained prominence in 1980 through the report
of  a  commission  established  by  the  president  of  the  World  Bank  to  make  recommendations  on
reducing international economic disparities. Steward Patrick and Alexandra Huggins, “The Term
‘Global  South’  Is  Surging.  It  Should  Be  Retired,”  Carnegie  Endowment  for  International  Peace,

China’s Diplomacy Adopts the Term “Global South”—
Continued
Although  China’s  government  has  not  explicitly  stated  its  mo-
tivation for adopting the term “Global South,” there are multiple
reasons why doing so may serve China’s interests. First, the term
is  increasingly  used  by  international  organizations  and  groups
(such  as  the  UN,  the World  Bank,  BRICS,  and  the  Group  of  77),
by  think  tanks,  media,  and  academia,  and  by  national  leaders,
and China’s leadership may see adopting it as a way to facilitate
promotion  of  its  priorities  internationally.109  Second,  the  grow-
ing  popularity  of  the  term  resonates  with  some  audiences *  as
an  expression  of  post-colonial  and  developing  country  solidarity
and further elevating the voices of low- and middle-income coun-
tries  in  global  governance—both  themes  that  China  has  sought
to leverage as justification for its international leadership and to
undercut  the  image  of  the  United  States.110  Third,  despite  the
Chinese  government’s  insistence  that  China  “will  always  belong
among developing countries,” the World Bank has classified China
as an upper middle economy since 2011 and the UN Development
Program  also  classifies  China  as  an  upper  middle  income  coun-
try.111 China’s leadership likely views the term “Global South” as
a tool to reframe and preserve its international status despite the
increasing  difficulty  of  justifying  its  entitlement  to  special  eco-
nomic treatment as a “developing country.” † 112

China Frames Its Diplomacy in Opposition to U.S. and Allied

Objectives

China’s  diplomacy  in  2024  reflected  CCP  objectives  to  leverage
its  perceived  international  influence  against  the  United  States  and
its  allies  and  partners. These  objectives  were  laid  out  at  the  CCP’s
December 2023 Central Foreign Affairs Work Conference,‡ which as-

China  membership  in  the “Global  South”  in  order  to  disrupt  its  relations  with  developing  coun-
tries as part of strategic competition against China. Li Yan, “Where Did the Term ‘Global South’
Originate?”  China-US  Focus,  September  21,  2023;  Zhao  Minghao, “The  Global  South,  the  Global
East, and U.S.-China Rivalry,” China-US Focus, August 22, 2023.

* Critics  of  the  term “Global  South”  and  its  recent  resurgence  argue  that  the  term  geographi-
cally  is  inaccurate  or  that  it  risks  reinforcing  stereotypes  by  grouping  together  countries  with  a
wide range of economic and political conditions and differing interests. The practice of classifying
countries  as “developing”  versus “developed”  has  also  been  critiqued  for  implying  a  linear  stan-
dard  of  technological  progress  with  a  Western  standard  as  its  endpoint,  with  the  World  Bank
announcing  in  2015  that  it  would  begin  to  phase  out  use  of  this  terminology.  Erica  Hogan  and

† Although  the  report  that  popularized  the  term  categorized  developing  countries  as  being  lo-
cated  largely  in  the  southern  hemisphere  and  developed  countries  as  being  located  largely  in
the  northern  hemisphere,  it  included  China  within  the  remit  of  the  “Global  South.”  The  report
included a visual depiction of the north-south divide in per-capita gross domestic product (GDP)
in what became known as the “Brandt Line,” which ran across northern border of Mexico, Africa,
the  Middle  East,  India,  and  China  and  encompasses  most  of  East  Asia  while  avoiding  Japan,

‡ A CCP Central Foreign Affairs Work Conference is a major periodic meeting that serves as a
strategic guide for the conduct and coordination of China’s foreign affairs. This was the third such

112

sessed  that  China  has  new  strategic  opportunities  in  part  because
it has strengthened its “strategic autonomy and initiative” over the
past decade and increased its international influence.113 At the same
time,  official  summaries  revealed  concern  about  the  policy  adjust-
ments  countries  around  the  world  are  making  to  mitigate  China’s
challenges to their own economic and security interests. The readout
of the conference in People’s Daily argues that China must “resolute-
ly  oppose”  forces  it  labeled “anti-globalization,” “pan-securitization,”
“unilateralism,”  and  “protectionism,”  most  likely  referring  to  mea-
sures  such  as  trade  restrictions,  export  controls,  and  international
sanctions by countries including the United States and many Euro-
pean states.114 Top Party diplomat Wang Yi, who also serves as Chi-
na’s  Minister  of  Foreign  Affairs,  echoed  these  concerns  on  January
9, 2024, when he repackaged the conclusions of the CCP conference
into a Ministry of Foreign Affairs presentation on China’s diplomatic
goals for 2024, pledging “to firmly oppose all forms of unilateralism,
protectionism  and  anti-globalization”  and  to “maintain  the  stability
and  smoothness  of  global  industrial  chains  and  supply  chains.” 115
He  also  stated  that  China  opposes  “small  circles  that  seek  geopo-
litical  purposes  and  small  blocs  that  undermine  stability,”  referring
to  closer  coordination  between  the  United  States  and  its  allies  in
Europe  and  Asia  to  address  risks  from  China  as  well  as  the  U.S.
alliance system more generally.116

The Central Foreign Affairs Work Conference presaged an even
stronger focus on influencing other countries to align their policy
choices  with  China’s  preferences,  especially  through  attempted
persuasion  and  narrative  control.  Reinforcing  the  idea  that  the
CCP’s  objectives  are  both  global  and  competitive  with  those  of
the  United  States  and  its  partners,  official  descriptions  of  the
conference  argued  that  China  has  an  imperative  to  “unite  the
majority  of  the  international  community”  and  “unite  to  win  the
majority  of  the  world.” 117  In  support  of  this  goal,  the  Central
Foreign Affairs Work  Conference  sought  to  codify  an  equivalence
between China’s interests and the interests and challenges of the
world,  especially  those  of  low-  and  middle-income  countries.  It
anointed  Xi’s  concept  of  a  “community  of  common  human  des-
tiny”  as  the  “main  line”  of  China’s  diplomacy  in  the  future  and
promoted  it  as  reflecting  not  only  China’s  objectives  but  also  the
interests  and  desires  of  all  of  humanity.118  The  conference  also
put  forward  two  phrases—“equal  and  orderly  multipolarization”
and  “beneficial  and  inclusive  economic  globalization”—as  pro-
posed  solutions  to  the  “major  issues  and  challenges  facing  the
world.” 119 Although designed to present a positive framing, these

meeting  since  General  Secretary  Xi  took  power  in  2012.  The  meeting  codified  both  a  retrospec-
tive assessment of the major achievements the CCP claims to have made in its diplomacy under
Xi’s tenure as well as forward-looking principles for the conduct of China’s foreign affairs in the
future.  Neil  Thomas,  “Xi  Signals  Firm  Strategy  but  Flexible  Tactics  at  China’s  Central  Foreign

tition  with  China.  As  Minister  Wang  clarified  in  an  elaboration
on  the  conclusions  of  the  conference  in  the  Party  journal  Qiushi
in  January  2024,  “equal  and  orderly  multipolarization”  was  con-
ceived in opposition to what the CCP calls “hegemony and power
politics,”  while  “beneficial  and  inclusive  economic  globalization”
stands  in  opposition  to  so-called “protectionism,” “unilateralism,”
and “anti-globalization.” 120

Throughout  2024,  China’s  political,  diplomatic,  and  military  rep-
resentatives used multilateral meetings as platforms to sell messag-
es  from  the  Central  Foreign  Affairs  Work  Conference.  At  the  Boao
Forum for Asia in March 2024, Politburo Member Zhao Leji argued
that the international community must choose between China’s pos-
itive approach—represented by Xi’s concept of a “community of com-
mon human destiny” and its vision of an “equal and orderly multipo-
lar world”—and a negative approach featuring economic restrictions
and  outdated  “bloc  confrontation.” 121  At  the  Shanghai  Cooperation
Organization (SCO) Minister’s Council in May 2024, Minister Wang
argued that China would work with the SCO to promote “equal and
orderly  world  multipolarization  and  inclusive  economic  globaliza-
tion,” and he criticized “a few countries” for promoting “small circles”
and  advocating “decoupl[ing].” 122 Without  offering  any  evidence,  he
even  claimed  that  these  countries  are  working  to  “fuel  the  ‘three
evil  forces’ ”—terrorism,  separatism,  and  extremism.123  In  remarks
at  the  Shangri-La  Dialogue  in  June  2024,  Minister  of  National  De-
fense Admiral Dong Jun presented China as a constructive force for
the world and stated that Xi’s community of common human desti-
ny  and  three  global  initiatives  constituted  China’s “Global  Security
Concept.” 124  Minister  Dong  also  stated  China’s  opposition  to  what
he  called  other  countries’  “attempts  at  decoupling,  cutting  supply
chains,  or  building  a  small  yard  with  high  fences”  and  attempts  to
“create  conflict  and  chaos”  in  the  Asia-Pacific  region,  and  China’s
state  media  later  openly  confirmed  that  the  latter  comment  was
targeted  at  the  United  States  and  its  allies.125  At  an  internation-
al  conference  China  hosted  to  mark  the  70th  anniversary  of  the
Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence in June 2024, Xi declared his
“vision”  of  a  community  of  common  human  destiny  as  the  modern
embodiment  of  those  principles  and  rigorously  promoted  his  three
major global initiatives.126

In  a  continuation  and  intensification  of  China’s  longstanding  ef-
forts  to  use  low-  and  middle-  income  countries  as  a  counterbalance
for  the  United  States,  China’s  leaders  in  2024  sought  to  generate
diplomatic  support  by  claiming  that  China’s  foreign  policy  reflects
the  wishes  and  interests  of  the  “Global  South.”  In  a  Qiushi  article
in  March  2024,  Head  of  the  International  Liaison  Department  Liu
Jianchao,  argued  that  the  “Global  South”  was  “an  important  force”
and  “strong  support”  for  these  two  concepts  of  “equal  and  orderly
multipolarization”  and “beneficial  and  inclusive  economic  globaliza-
tion” introduced at the Central Foreign Affairs Work Conference.127
He  claimed  the  “Global  South”  did  not  support  “small  yards  high
fences,”  “decoupling  and  breaking  chains,”  “confrontation  between
camps,”  “unilateralism,”  or  “protectionism.” 128  He  also  promoted

Xi’s  global  initiatives  as  solutions  for  the  development  challenges
facing these countries.” * 129 In his own speech marking the 70th an-
niversary of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence in late June
2024,  Xi  stated  that  the  “Global  South”  should  “take  the  lead”  in
building a community of common human destiny and implementing
his global initiatives.130 He announced the establishment of a “Glob-
al South research center” to provide 1,000 scholarships and 100,000
training opportunities for “Global South” countries over the next five
years, the establishment of a “Global South youth leaders program,”
and a stated interest in concluding new free trade agreements with
“Global South” countries.131

China Advances  Strategic  Relations  and  Support  for  Russia
while  Presenting  Itself  as  an  Advocate  of  Peace  in
Ukraine

In  the  face  of  mounting  criticism  from  Western  governments,
China  continued  to  deepen  its  strategic  partnership  with  Russia
as  both  countries  agreed  to  develop  greater  cooperation  and  coor-
dination  to  counter  U.S.  and  allied  policies,  including  efforts  in  the
Indo-Pacific  region  and  support  for  Russia’s  war  of  aggression  in
Ukraine.  During  Russian  President  Vladimir  Putin’s  state  visit  to
Beijing  in  May  2024,  the  two  countries  signed  a  Joint  Statement
that  expressed  an  alignment  between  Russia  and  China  on  shared
grievances against the United States and its allies and other areas
of convergence, including the following: 132

 • Both  countries  agreed  to  strengthen  their  coordination  and  co-
operation in response to U.S. and allied military activities in the
Asia  Pacific,  which  China  and  Russia  regard  as  hostile  policies
of “dual containment.” 133

 • China and Russia expressed shared concern on threats to their
security, such as the United States’ missile defense capabilities
and  its  plans  to  deploy  land-based  intermediate  range  missile
systems  in  the  Asia  Pacific.134  The  Joint  Statement  further
blamed  the  United  States  Indo-Pacific  Strategy  and  NATO  ac-
tivities  for  negatively  impacting  peace  and  stability  in  the  re-
gion.135

 • Russia  also  joined  China  in  expressing  serious  concern  about
the  Australia,  UK,  and  U.S.  (AUKUS)  partnership,  and  both
countries raised opposition to the “intervention of external forc-
es in the South China Sea.” 136

 • Both  countries  criticized  the  United  States  and  its  allies’  poli-
cies  toward  North  Korea,  calling  on  them  to “abandon  [policies
of]  intimidation,  sanctions  and  suppression”  without  holding
North Korea accountable for continued missile tests.137

 • China  and  Russia  agreed  to  expand  bilateral  trade  and  invest-
ment  and  to  jointly  secure  their  respective  industrial  supply
chain.138

* Many of these countries are nevertheless heavily indebted to China. Daniel F. Runde, Rafael
Romeu, and Austin Hardman, “Reintroducing Concessional Loans into the Development Toolbox,”

Pushing World’s Poorest Countries to Brink of Collapse,” AP News, May 18, 2023.

 • China  and  Russia  agreed  to  deepen  military  cooperation  by
expanding  the  scale  of  joint  exercises  and  training,  organizing
more  regular  joint  maritime  and  air  patrols,  and  continuing  to
improve  their  ability  to  respond  jointly  to  risks  and  challeng-
es.139  In  2024,  China  and  Russia  have  continued  to  conduct
joint  exercises.  In  July,  China  and  Russia’s  navies  participated
in  a  bilateral  joint  exercise  titled  Joint  Sea-2024,  which  began
at China’s southern military port in Zhanjiang and included an-
ti-missile exercises, sea strikes, and air defense drills.140 In the
second  week  of  September  2024,  China  and  Russia  coordinat-
ed on a large-scale naval exercise called Ocean-2024 reportedly
spanning Pacific and Arctic waters, the Mediterranean Sea, the
Caspian  Sea,  and  the  Baltic  Sea.141  Later  in  September  2024,
the two militaries launched a joint naval and air exercise in the
Seas  of  Japan  and  Okhotsk  that  reportedly  included  anti-air-
craft and anti-submarine weapons.142

 • On Taiwan, Russia stated its adherence to the One China prin-
ciple, recognized Taiwan as “an inseparable part of the People’s
Republic of China,” and “firmly” supported China’s measures to
pursue unification.143

Nonetheless, there are areas of potential friction in the China-Rus-
sia relationship.144 The power asymmetry between Russia and Chi-
na  has  increasingly  shifted  in  China’s  favor  since  Russia’s  annex-
ation  of  Crimea  in  2014,  resulting  in  an  uncomfortable  reality  for
Russia whereby Moscow is now viewed as the “junior partner” in the
bilateral relationship.145 China has attempted to influence Moscow’s
decision  making.  In  July  2023,  the  Financial  Times  reported  that
General  Secretary  Xi  personally  warned  Russian  President  Putin
against using nuclear weapons in Ukraine, and Chinese officials pri-
vately  took  credit  for  convincing  Russia  to  back  down  from  Putin’s
veiled  threats.146  Zhao Tong,  senior  fellow  at  the  Carnegie  Endow-
ment  for  International  Peace,  assesses  that  while  “China  supports
the  goal  of  undermining  Western  influence,  it  does  not  agree  with
some  of  Russia’s  tactics  [in  Ukraine],  including  the  threat  of  using
nuclear weapons.” 147 While Russia is focused on its war in Ukraine,
China also has an opportunity to expand its influence in areas where
interests  have  historically  overlapped,  such  as  in  Central Asia  and
the Artic  region.148 Another  point  of  potential  friction  is  the  terms
of a deal on a Russia-China gas pipeline called the Power of Siberia
2,  which  is  owned  by  Russia’s  state  gas  export  monopoly  Gazprom
and is intended to link the Chinese market through Mongolia to gas
fields in western Russia that previously supplied Europe.149 Accord-
ing to the Financial Times, Beijing is asking to pay close to Russia’s
subsidized  domestic  prices  and  is  only  committing  to  buy  a  small
fraction  of  the  pipeline’s  annual  capacity—demands  Moscow  views
as unreasonable.150 A mutually acceptable deal on the pipeline was
reportedly  one  of  three  requests  President  Putin  made  to  Xi  when
the  two  leaders  met  in  May  2024.* 151  Russia’s  continued  failure
to  obtain  terms  it  views  as  acceptable  displays  the  leverage  China

* According to the Financial Times, Putin’s other two requests were more Chinese bank activity
in  Russia  and  for  China  to  snub  the  peace  conference  that  was  organized  by  Ukraine  and  held
in  Switzerland  in  June  2024.  Max  Seddon  et  al.,  “Russia-China  Gas  Pipeline  Deal  Stalls  over
Beijing’s Price Demands,” Financial Times, June 2, 2024.

holds over Russia, and this dynamic of dependency is likely to deep-
en in the future.152

China’s  diplomatic  and  economic  support  to  Russia  has  been  a
decisive enabler of Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine.153 In
expanding its trade with Russia, China has helped rebuild Russia’s
defense  industrial  base  and  mitigate  the  effects  of  Western  sanc-
tions  and  export  controls.154  In  testimony  to  the  U.S.  Senate  Com-
mittee on Armed Services on May 2, 2024, U.S. Director of National
Intelligence  Avril  Haines  said  that  while  China  has  not  provided
lethal  support  to  Russia  in  the  form  of  a  “fully  constructed  gun  or
weapon  system,”  China  has  provided  dual-use  materials  that  have
been  vital  for  the  “reconstitution  of  Russia’s  military  strength.” 155
During comments made to reporters in Brussels in September 2024,
U.S.  Deputy  Secretary  of  State  Kurt  Campbell  assessed  China  has
made  substantial  efforts  to  “sustain,  build,  and  diversify”  Russia’s
war  machine.156  He  stated  that  the  component  pieces  China  has
provided  “are  not  dual-use  capabilities,”  rather  they  directly  help
Russia’s military.157 He further stated that in exchange for China’s
support, Moscow has been helping Beijing develop submarine, aero-
nautic, and missile technologies.158 Despite overwhelming evidence,
China’s  Ministry  of  Foreign  Affairs  has  continued  to  reject  claims
that  its  activities  support  Russia’s  war  effort,  stating  on  June  19,
2024  that,  “China  does  not  provide  weapons  to  the  parties  to  the
conflict and strictly controls the export of dual-use articles.” 159 Oth-
er new developments in 2024 include:

 • An  April  2024  report  by  the  Financial  Times  cited  senior  U.S.
officials  saying  “China  had  also  supplied  90  percent  of  chips
imported  by  Russia  last  year  which  were  being  used  to  make
tanks,  missiles,  and  aircraft.” 160  The  U.S.  officials  note  that
several Chinese companies such as Wuhan Global Sensor Tech-
nology,  Wuhan  Tongsheng  Technology,  and  Hikvision  provided
optical components in Russian tanks and armored vehicles.161
 • On  May  1,  2024,  the  U.S.  Department  of  State  designated  sev-
eral Chinese entities that were found responsible for developing
and supplying dual-use aerospace, manufacturing, and technol-
ogy  equipment  to  entities  based  in  Russia.162  As  an  example,
one  of  the  Chinese  entities  included  Mornsun  Guangzhou  Sci-
ence and Technology Co LTD, which supplied electronic integral
monolithic  circuits  to  a  Russia-based  entity  that  specializes  in
the  production  and  marketing  of  airborne  weapons  control  ra-
dars for Russian fighter aircraft.163

 • On  June  12,  2024,  the  Treasury  Department  issued  new  sanc-
tions  on  entities  that  support  Russia’s  war  economy  and  mil-
itary-industrial  base.164  As  one  example,  Treasury  sanctioned
the  China-based  Shenzhen  Youxin  Technology  Co  Ltd  (Shen-
zhen Youxin),  which  was  said  to  have  provided  electronic  inte-
grated  circuits  and  other  components  to  Russia-based  distribu-
tor Elekkom Logistik, which supplies Russia’s defense industry
with foreign-made electronic components used in the production
of  unmanned  aerial  vehicles  (UAVs).165  Shenzhen  Youxin  also
provided microchips found in Russian reconnaissance UAVs.166

117

 • On  September  24,  2024,  Ukraine’s  presidential  advisor  Vla-
dyslav  Vlasiuk  told  reporters  that  roughly  60  percent  of  for-
eign-made  components  found  in  Russian  weapons  recovered
from the battlefield in Ukraine come from China.167

 • In  2024,  the  U.S.  Department  of  Commerce  placed  numerous
Chinese entities on the Entity List for supporting Russia’s mil-
itary. For example, on April 11, 2024, Jiangxi Xintuo Enterprise
Co.  Ltd.,  was  added  to  the  Entity  List  for “supporting  Russia’s
military  through  the  procurement,  development,  and  prolifer-
ation”  of  Russian  UAVs.168  On  May  14,  Commerce  added  six
additional Chinese entities to the Entity List for being involved
in  the  shipment  of  controlled  items  to  Russia.169  On  August
23, 2024, Commerce added 42 entities in China, including Hong
Kong, for shipping U.S.-origin and U.S.-branded items to Russia,
contravening U.S. export controls.170

China’s  Ukraine  Peace  Diplomacy  Falls  Short  in  Europe,

Echoes Russia’s Views

In March 2024, China made a show of conducting so-called “shut-
tle  diplomacy” *  between  Russia,  Ukraine,  and  European  countries,
but—not  surprisingly—efforts  by  a  country  in  a  self-described  “no
limits”  partnership  with  the  aggressor  country  have  not  produced
any  tangible  result.171  From  March  2  to  11,  2024,  China’s  Special
Representative  of  the  Chinese  Government  for  Eurasian  Affairs
Li  Hui  visited  Russia,  the  EU  headquarters  in  Brussels,  Poland,
Ukraine,  Germany,  and  France  to  promote  a  political  settlement  of
the  war  in  Ukraine.172 These  meetings,  although  highly  praised  in
China’s  own  Party-state  media,  appeared  to  culminate  in  a  single
briefing in Beijing for domestic and foreign media and the diplomat-
ic envoys stationed in China.173

China  continues  to  advocate  for  a  political  and  diplomatic  settle-
ment to the war with Ukraine that Moscow has endorsed.† 174 During
discussions between Li Hui and EU representatives, it was reported
that Li Hui presented a repetition of Moscow’s talking points.175 Ac-
cording to officials familiar with the talks, Li Hui reportedly told EU
officials  that  discussion  on  Ukraine’s  territorial  integrity  would  not
take  place  until  violence  stopped,  which  he  said  could  only  happen
when the EU stops sending weapons to Ukraine.176 The impression
Li Hui reportedly left on officials in Brussels was that China simply
sought  to  create  the  illusion  of  good  faith  efforts  to  end  Russia’s
war  in  Ukraine—when  in  reality  the  move  was  likely  intended  to

* The term “shuttle diplomacy” refers to negotiations especially between countries carried on by
an intermediary who goes back and forth between disputants. China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs
refers  to  these  activities  as  its  “second  round  of  shuttle  diplomacy  on  the  Ukraine  crisis.”  The
so-called first round occurred in May 2023. China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Special Represen-
tative of the Chinese Government on Eurasian Affairs Li Hui Holds Briefing on the Second Round

na’s Embassy in Iceland, Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Mao Ning’s Regular Press Conference on
May 29, 2023, March 29, 2023.

† According  to  Russia’s  Ministry  of  Foreign Affairs,  during  Li  Hui’s  meeting  with  the  Russian
Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Galuzin on March 2 in Moscow, both sides discussed the issue
that “a  settlement  in  Ukraine  is  impossible  without  the  participation  of  Russia  and  taking  into
account  its  security  interests.”  TASS,  “Russian  and  Chinese  Diplomats  Noted  That  Discussing
a  Settlement  in  Ukraine  Is  Impossible  without  the  Russian  Federation”  (Дипломаты  РФ  и  КНР

mitigate risks to its own interests as a result of its support for Rus-
sia.177  Li  Hui  also  used  his  meetings  with  EU  officials  to  condemn
the  EU’s  sanctions—released  on  February  23,  2024—on  three  Chi-
nese  firms  and  one  Hong  Kong-based  company  due  to  their  role  in
trading  electronic  components  of  EU-origin  products  to  Russia.178
In  a  readout  of  meetings  published  by  China’s  Ministry  of  Foreign
Affairs, Li Hui urged the EU to unconditionally cancel the listing of
Chinese  enterprises  and  return  to  the  “right  track”  of  consultation
with China.179

Despite China’s vocal claims that it has “stayed committed to pro-
moting  peace  talks  and  played  a  positive  role  in  efforts  to  restore
peace,” Beijing declined to participate in the Swiss peace summit on
Ukraine from June 15 to 16, 2024.180 China’s Ministry of Foreign Af-
fairs spokesperson said the Swiss peace summit failed to incorporate
three elements proposed by China: recognition from both Russia and
Ukraine, equal participation of all parties, and fair discussion of all
peace plans.181 Instead, China offered a proposal for peace negotia-
tions jointly developed with Brazil in May 2024.* 182 Russia has in-
dicated its support for China’s proposal, with Russia’s Foreign Min-
ister Sergei Lavrov indicating that China should consider arranging
a peace conference in which both Russia and Ukraine would partic-
ipate.183  Minister  Lavrov  said  in  an  interview  with  RIA,  a  Russian
state-owned  news  agency,  that  Russia  shares  China’s  position  that
“root  causes  of  the  conflict  need  to  be  addressed  in  the  first  place
and  legal  interests  of  all  parties  need  to  be  protected.” 184  Finally,
undermining  Ukraine’s  attempts  to  build  international  consensus
on  its  approach  to  resolve  the  conflict,  China  increased  diplomatic
outreach to other global leaders in Turkey, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the
United Arab  Emirates,  South Africa,  Indonesia,  and  Kazakhstan  in
a  so-called  “third  round  of  shuttle  diplomacy”  to  build  support  for
China’s Russian-approved peace proposals.185

China  Pushes  Europe  to  View  It  as  a  Partner,  with  Mixed

Results

China  intensified  its  European  diplomacy  in  2024  in  an  effort  to
offset  European  criticism  of  its  support  for  Ukraine  and  to  discour-
age  closer  coordination  of  U.S.  and  European  policies  on  trade  and
other issues, hoping to maintain access to the economic and political
benefits that close ties with European countries can provide. In his
presentation at the start of the year on China’s diplomatic goals for
2024, Minister Wang described China’s major objective for its Euro-
pean  diplomacy  as  “increas[ing]  high-level  exchanges  and  strategic
communication  with  the  EU  to  promote  the  steady  and  sustained

* China  and  Brazil’s  joint  proposal  for  peace  negotiations  with  the  participation  of  Russia  and
Ukraine  called  for  the  following  six  points:  (1)  All  relevant  parties  observe  three  principles  for
deescalating  the  situation,  namely  no  expansion  of  the  battlefield,  no  escalation  of  fighting,  and
no provocation by any party; (2) All parties should create conditions for the resumption of direct
dialogue  and  push  for  the  de-escalation  of  the  situation.  China  and  Brazil  support  an  interna-
tional  peace  conference  held  at  a  proper  time  that  is  recognized  by  both  Russia  and  Ukraine,
with equal participation of all parties as well as fair discussion of all peace plans; (3) Efforts are
needed  to  increase  humanitarian  assistance,  attacks  on  civilians  and  civilian  facilities  must  be
avoided, and prisoners of war (POWs) must be protected. China and Brazil support the exchange
of POWs; (4) The use of weapons of mass destruction, particularly nuclear weapons and chemical
and biological weapons, must be opposed; (5) Attacks on nuclear power plants and other peaceful
nuclear  facilities  must  be  opposed;  and  (6)  Dividing  the  world  into  isolated  political  or  economic
groups  should  be  opposed.  Government  of  Brazil,  Brazil  and  China  Present  Joint  Proposal  for

growth of their relations.” 186 Xi pursued this objective in a summit
with  the  EU  and  a  high-profile  tour  of  several  European  countries,
although  the  mainly  positive  messages  China  reported  from  those
meetings present a contrast with the two sides’ deepening disagree-
ments  over  Ukraine, *  electric  vehicles  (EVs),  and  other  economic
issues. (For more on China’s economic tensions with Europe in 2024,
see  Chapter  1,  “U.S.-China  Economic  and  Trade  Relations  (Year  in
Review).”)

During  a  leaders’  meeting  with  European  Commission  President
Ursula  von  der  Leyen  in  December  2023,  General  Secretary  Xi  ar-
gued  that  Europe  should  overlook  its  differences  with  China  in  fa-
vor  of  deeper  cooperation.187  Xi  endeavored  to  challenge  European
arguments  for  competition  or  rivalry  between  China  and  the  EU,
including  by  downplaying  the  relevance  of  its  authoritarian  polit-
ical  system.188  He  attempted  to  paint  China  as  a  critical  strategic
partner  for  the  EU  on  economic  and  trade  issues,  on  science  and
technology,  and  on  industrial  supply  chains.189  Xi  further  claimed
that China and the EU have a responsibility to cooperate on geopo-
litical matters, but he did so while invoking China’s own geopolitical
priorities †  and  attempting  to  discourage  EU  cooperation  with  the
United  States.‡ 190  Throughout  2024,  China’s  diplomats  continued
to  argue  that  European  governments  should  adhere  to  Xi’s  desired
pattern of prioritizing partnership over differences.§ 191

* In  June  2024,  the  EU  imposed  sanctions  on  19  Chinese  companies  for  being  involved  in  the
“circumvention  of  trade  restrictions  and  engaged  in  the  procurement  of  sensitive  item,”  such  as
the  production  of  drones,  or “providing  material  support  for  Russian  military  operations.  France

“two major markets supporting globalization,” and “two major civilizations advocating diversity.”

forestall  the  development  of “bloc  confrontation”  and “anti-globalization,”  and  he  expressed  frus-
tration at the EU’s three-fold view of China as simultaneously a partner, competitor, and systemic
rival. Later in March, China’s Consul General in Strasbourg, France, delivered a speech describ-
ing  China  and  Europe  as  two  major  geopolitical  forces  advancing  “multipolarization”  and  “glo-
balization,”  repeating  both  Xi’s  framing  on  China-Europe  relations  and  the  overall  objectives  of
China’s diplomacy laid out at the Central Foreign Affairs Work Conference. He expressed “regret”
at  what  he  called  “discordant  voices”  promoting  the  EU’s  partner-competitor-rival  characteriza-
tion  of  China  and  openly  blamed  the  United  States  for  having  inspired  the  “rival”  aspect.  Con-

Xi  also  traveled  to  Europe  in April  2024  in  an  effort  to  reinforce
his message.192 Many Western analysts observed that Xi’s itinerary
of  France,  Serbia,  and  Hungary  featured  what  could  be  viewed  as
China’s  stronger  relationships  in  Europe,  an  argument  that  Party
media  also  confirmed  from  Beijing’s  perspective.* 193  Outcomes  of
the  trip  for  China  were  mixed,  however,  cementing  China’s  already
strong  diplomatic  position  in  Serbia  and  Hungary  but  also  casting
remaining differences with France and the EU into sharper relief:

 • France: Ahead of the visit, Minister Wang reportedly told French
President Emmanuel Macron’s diplomatic advisor that he hoped
Paris  could  push  the  EU  to  pursue  a  more  pragmatic  policy
toward  China.194  Nevertheless,  in  a  trilateral  meeting  with
General  Secretary  Xi  in  Paris,  President  Macron  and  Europe-
an Commission President von der Leyen reportedly emphasized
China’s responsibility to resolve structural economic difficulties,
particularly  related  to  trade  and  its  export  of  overcapacity  in
new  energy  products,  while  China’s  readout  suggests  Xi  took
the contrasting position, claiming that “the so-called ‘problem of
China’s overcapacity’ does not exist.” 195 Reporting also suggests
the two European leaders pushed Xi on China’s continued sup-
port for Russia’s war in Ukraine, a discussion that China’s read-
out  omits  in  favor  of  a  regurgitation  of  official  talking  points
and  self-congratulatory  language  about  China’s  supposed  con-
tributions  to  ending  the  conflict.196  Although  short  on  details,
some  French  media  coverage  suggests  that  “several  hours”  of
bilateral  talks  between  Macron  and  Xi  may  not  have  gone  en-
tirely as planned for either side, with certain topics such as cli-
mate  change,  human  rights, Taiwan,  and  the  South  China  Sea
having “eclipsed” other issues.197

 • Serbia:  In  a  victory  for  Beijing’s  agenda,  Serbia  expressed  an
official commitment to Xi’s concept of a “community of common
human  destiny”  and  agreed  to  establish  a  “China-Serbia  com-
munity  of  common  destiny,”  with  Serbia’s  President  Aleksan-
dar Vucic  describing  it  as “the  highest  possible  form  of  cooper-
ation between two countries.” 198 President Vucic also reiterated
support  for  Beijing’s  One  China  principle,  referred  to  tensions

* For  example,  the  same  People’s  Daily  article  in  Qiushi  argues  that  China-France  relations
have  always  been  “at  the  forefront  of  China’s  relations  with  Western  countries”  and  attributes
their  recent  ability  to  “maintain  good  development  momentum”  to  a  shared  spirit  of  “indepen-
dence.”  This  is  likely  referencing  French  President  Emmanuel  Macron’s  willingness  to  publicly
take  positions  that  differ  from  those  of  the  United  States  on  certain  issues  of  China  policy  and
France’s  emphasis  on  the  European  concept  of “strategic  autonomy,”  a  policy  concept  emphasiz-
ing  the  agency  of  European  powers  that  China  has  attempted  to  push  European  governments
to  interpret  to  mean  distancing  themselves  from  policies  that  challenge  China’s  interests  and
refraining  from  coordination  with  the  United  States  over  such  policies.  The  article  states  that
China and Serbia “have a deep ironclad friendship” that “can be regarded as a model of friendly
relations  between  China  and  European  countries.”  It  describes  Hungary  as  an  important  BRI
partner  that  has “insisted  on . . .  eliminating  interference  and  pressure  and  firmly  deepening  co-
operation with China” even “under the turbulent international situation”—an approach it argues
“strongly  proves”  that  China  is  an  opportunity  rather  than  a  challenge  to  Europe.  He Yin, “Pro-

across the Strait as China’s internal issue, and reportedly drew
parallels  between  Taiwan  and  Kosovo.199  Other  favorable  out-
comes  for  China  included  a  signing  ceremony  for  a  free  trade
agreement  on  certain  agricultural  goods  and  bilateral  agree-
ments on cultural and scientific exchanges.* 200

 • Hungary:  During  the  visit,  China  and  Hungary  declared  an
elevation  of  their  relationship  to  “all-weather  comprehensive
strategic  partnership  for  the  new  era,”  which  observers  view
as  a  step  up  from  the  previous  “comprehensive  strategic  part-
nership”  they  had  established  in  2017.† 201  General  Secretary
Xi  and  Hungarian  Prime  Minister  Viktor  Orbán  oversaw  the
signing  of  17  agreements  between  the  two  countries.202  One
news  outlet  reports  that  they  agreed  to  strengthen  high-level
exchanges,  continue  pursuing  BRI,  and  promote  deeper  coop-
eration  in  areas  including  clean  energy,  AI,  mobile  communi-
cation  technology  and  nuclear  energy,  while  another  lists  coop-
eration  in  supply  chains,  culture,  media,  and  other  sectors.203
During  the  meeting  with  Xi,  Prime  Minister  Orbán  reportedly
welcomed more Chinese businesses to invest in Hungary.204 He
also notably distanced Hungary from EU positions, stating that
Budapest  did  not  agree  with  EU’s  “de-risking”  policy  or  con-
cerns about overcapacity of China’s EVs and batteries.205

A  stream  of  meetings  by  the  director  of  the  CCP’s  Internation-
al Liaison Department with political parties and individual leaders
across  the  continent  in  the  first  half  of  the  year  also  revealed  that
the  Party  perceives  a  very  wide  range  in  European  governments’
willingness  to  interact  on  China’s  terms.  In  a  meeting  with  a  Ger-
man  delegation,  Director  Liu  communicated  the  CCP’s  desire  for
greater  “dialogue  and  cooperation”  in  strategic  relations  with  Eu-
rope  broadly  and  with  Germany  specifically.206 When  meeting  with
the  ambassador  from  the  Netherlands,  he  encouraged  the  country
to  contribute  to  promoting  “stable”  China-Europe  relations  and  to
“push  the  EU  to  adhere  to  openness”  and “oppose ‘de-coupling.’ ” 207
In a meeting with a Finnish diplomat, Director Liu similarly stated
a hope that Finland would “push China-EU relations” toward “stable
development.” 208 While meeting the Polish ambassador, he called for
deepened  exchanges  and  emphasized  Poland’s  importance  to  China
as an EU member with influence in Central and Eastern Europe.209
To Spain’s ambassador, by contrast, Director Liu expressed appreci-
ation  for  the  country’s  “adherence  to  a  positive  and  friendly  policy
toward  China,”  and  a  readout  of  the  meeting  with  Slovakia’s  am-
bassador  focused  mainly  on  promoting  BRI  and  deepening  political
exchanges.210  In  a  party-to-party  engagement  with  representatives
from  Hungary,  Director  Liu  praised  the  two  countries’  “traditional
friendship”  and  mutual  support  on  issues  concerning  “core  inter-
ests,”  argued  for  compatibility  between  BRI  and  Hungary’s  foreign

latory,  and  economic  cooperation. Arthur  Kaufman, “Xi’s Visits  to  Serbia  and  Hungary,  Pushing
Wedge into Europe,” China Digital Times, May 10, 2024.

† According to an expert from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences speaking to China’s state
media  in  2015,  the  “all-weather”  label  signifies  that  China  and  a  country  have  close  relations
“regardless of changes in time or global landscape.” Other countries with this “all-weather” label
include Belarus, Ethiopia, Pakistan, Uzbekistan, and Venezuela. Kelly Wang and Hu Xuan, “Chi-
na, Hungary Elevates Ties to ‘All Weather’ Partnership,” Caixin Global, May 10, 2024.

policy,  and  promoted  expanded  exchanges  at  the  local  government
and  enterprise  levels.211  Director  Liu’s  meeting  with  the  ambassa-
dor from Belarus—a key Russian partner in Europe but not an EU
member—called for deepened exchanges across political, legislative,
social, and industrial domains and emphasized the two states’ com-
mitment to mutual support for “core interests.” 212

Finally,  when  European  actions  did  not  conform  to  China’s  pre-
ferred  pattern  for  the  relationship,  China’s  proclaimed  desire  for
strategic  stability  did  not  prevent  it  from  launching  harsh  criti-
cisms.  On  July  11,  2024,  Germany  announced  a  new  two-step  plan
to  ban  the  use  of  critical  components  made  by  Huawei  and  ZTE  in
core parts of the country’s 5G network beginning in 2026.213 Reject-
ing the German government’s security concerns, China’s Ministry of
Foreign Affairs framed the policy decision as “politicizing trade and
tech  issues”  and “disrupt[ing]  normal  exchanges  and  cooperation  in
technology.” 214 The following day, a spokesperson for China’s Minis-
try of Foreign Affairs criticized the EU for releasing a statement re-
iterating its support for the conclusion of the legally binding South
China Sea arbitration ruling.215

NATO Sharpens Its Position on Challenges from China
The  United  States  continued  to  urge  Europe  and  NATO  al-
lies  to  place  increased  scrutiny  on  China’s  support  for  Rus-
sia’s  war  in  Ukraine.  During  U.S.  Deputy  Secretary  of  State
Kurt  Campbell’s  visit  to  Brussels  in  September  2024,  he  met
with  Belgian,  NATO,  and  EU  officials  and  urged  more  force-
ful  condemnation  of  China’s  “substantial  support”  to  Russia’s
military industrial base and deepening defense cooperation.216
According  to  Mr.  Campbell,  while  some  countries  in  the  EU
and  NATO  may  take  differing  perspectives,  the  United  States,
the  EU,  and  NATO  allies  are  increasingly  aligned  on  policies
related  to  China.217 At  the  conclusion  of  its  July  2024  summit
in  Washington,  DC,  NATO  released  a  declaration  stating  the
alliance’s  strongest  position  to  date  on  challenges  from  China,
reflecting an escalation of concerns about China’s irresponsible
international  behavior.  Most  notably,  the  declaration  labeled
China “a decisive enabler of Russia’s war against Ukraine” and
stated  that  China  “cannot  enable  the  largest  war  in  Europe
in  recent  history  without  this  negatively  impacting  its  inter-
ests  and  reputation.” 218  NATO  called  on  China  to  “cease  all
material  and  political  support  to  Russia’s  war  effort,”  specifi-
cally  citing  the  “transfer  of  dual-use  materials  such  as  weap-
ons  components,  equipment,  and  raw  materials  that  serve  as
inputs for Russia’s defense sector.” 219 This language represents
a  significant  evolution  beyond  the  communique  issued  only  a
year prior at NATO’s 2023 summit in Vilnius, Lithuania, which
had  called  upon  China  to  “act  responsibly,”  “play  a  construc-
tive role,” and “abstain from supporting Russia’s war effort.” 220
Concern  about  China’s  “deepening  strategic  partnership”  with
Russia  and  the  two  countries’ “mutually  reinforcing  efforts”  to
undercut the rules-based international order was also elevated
to  a  much  more  prominent  section  of  the  document.221  Aside

NATO Sharpens Its Position on Challenges from China—
Continued
from Russia and Ukraine, the 2024 declaration maintained at-
tention  on  previously  mentioned  concerns  about  China’s “stat-
ed ambitions and coercive policies,” including China’s malicious
cyber  activities  and  disinformation,  and  the  expansion  of  its
nuclear  arsenal.222

China  seized  upon  the  occasion  of  the  summit  to  promote  dis-
information  about  NATO  and  also  revealed  its  own  heightened
concern about the group’s intensifying focus on China’s policies.*
China’s  Ministry  of  Foreign  Affairs  spokesperson  spoke  public-
ly  against  the  alliance  on  every  day  of  the  summit,  painting  it
repeatedly  as  a  serious  danger  to  the  world  and  accusing  its
members  of  seeking  to  “incite  confrontation  and  rivalry.” 223  On
July  11,  2024  the  spokesperson  also  accused  NATO  of  “spread-
ing  disinformation  created  by  the  [United  States]  and  blatantly
[seeking]  to  undermine  China’s  relations  with  Europe,”  ignoring
the agency of the alliance’s other members and mischaracterizing
the group as an anti-China tool of the United States.224 After the
conclusion  of  the  summit,  the  spokesperson  reacted  to  a  speech
by  NATO  Secretary  General  Jens  Stoltenberg  with  not  only  a
vociferous  denunciation  of  the  remarks  themselves,  but  also  ad
hominem attacks.225

China in the Indo-Pacific: Cooperation and Coercion

China  intensified  its  use  of  all  available  tools  from  persuasion
to  coercion  in  its  attempt  to  reshape  international  norms  and  poli-
cies  across  the  Indo-Pacific.  China’s  aggression  in  the  South  China
Sea reached new heights as it escalated longstanding harassment of
Philippine vessels and personnel within their own EEZ into violent
and  dangerous  clashes.  In  the  Pacific  Islands,  by  contrast,  China
courted the governments and political parties of both its traditional
partners  and  those  of  the  United  States,  seeking  not  only  endorse-
ments of its Taiwan policy but also stronger support for China’s role
as  a  key  economic  player  in  the  region  and  for  its  authoritarian
system.

* China  also  spoke  out  against  NATO’s  growing  relationships  with  countries  in  the  Indo-Pa-
cific,  as  leaders  or  deputies  from Australia,  New  Zealand,  Japan,  and  South  Korea  attended  the
NATO  summit  in Washington  DC  in  July  2024.  NATO  has  taken  steps  to  increase  coordination
with like-minded partners in the Indo-Pacific, having invited Australia, Japan, South Korea, and
New  Zealand  to  participate  in  ministerial-level  meetings  and  NATO  summits  since  December
2020.  In  2023,  NATO  and  Japanese  officials  acknowledged  ongoing  discussion  during  Secretary
General  Stoltenberg’s  January  visit  about  opening  a  NATO  liaison  office  in Tokyo  and  Japanese
mission to NATO. By June, however, President Macron had voiced opposition, arguing that NATO
should  not  expand  its  reach  beyond  the  North Atlantic  and  signaling  that  the  required  consent
of  all  31  NATO  members  might  not  be  possible.  In  response  to  the  reports  that  NATO  was  con-
sidering  opening  a  liaison  office  in  Tokyo,  China  criticized  the  plan  when  its  Foreign  Ministry
spokesperson  Wang  Wenbin  said  Japan  should  “avoid  doing  things  that  could  dismantle  trust
and affect peace and stability in the region.” China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Foreign Ministry

China Ramps Up Pressure on Taiwan’s New President

In  2024,  China  continued  to  intensify  its  coercion  of  Taiwan  fol-
lowing  the  inauguration  of Taiwan’s  new  President  Lai  Ching-te  of
the  ruling  Democratic  Progressive  Party  (DPP),  whom  Beijing  has
deemed  a  “separatist.” 226  In  June,  China  used  “lawfare”  tactics  to
intimidate Taiwan’s  government  and  people  through  the  announce-
ment  of  new  guidelines  that  officially  designate  “Taiwan  indepen-
dence”—including  the  denial  of  Beijing’s  claim  that  Taiwan  is  part
of  China,  the  promotion  of  Taiwan’s  participation  in  international
organizations, and attempts to change Taiwan’s status through legal
means in Taiwan—as a crime that is punishable by detention, prison
terms  ranging  from  three  years  to  life,  confiscation  of  possessions,
and even the death sentence.227 Beijing also employed economic co-
ercion  against Taiwan,  announcing  in  May  2024  that  it  would  sus-
pend some of the preferential trade benefits on 134 products export-
ed  from  Taiwan,  including  chemical  products,  metals,  rubbers  and
plastics,  and  machinery.228  Three  days  after  Taiwan’s  presidential
inauguration in May 2024, China conducted a military exercise, Op-
eration Joint Sword 2024A, to demonstrate its operational skills for
blockade  or  invasion.229  The  exercise  notably  included  the  China
Coast  Guard  (CCG)  and  represented  an  intimidating  show  of  mili-
tary might in tandem with its increasingly frequent and regular air
and naval operations around Taiwan.230 Beijing also continued dip-
lomatic  coercion  against  Taiwan,  for  example  by  making  attempts
to bully foreign parliamentarians and stop them from attending the
Inter-Parliamentary  Alliance  on  China  (IPAC) *  summit,  a  global
coalition  of  lawmakers  aimed  at  countering  threats  from  China.231
(For  a  more  in  depth  and  comprehensive  analysis  of  China’s  inten-
sified coercion against Taiwan, see Chapter 9, “Taiwan.”)

China’s Violence toward the Philippines Escalates

China’s  attempts  to  block  Philippine  activities  in  the  South  Chi-
na  Sea,  especially  resupply  missions  to  the  Philippine  Navy  trans-
port  ship  Sierra  Madre  grounded  on  the  reef  near  Second  Thomas
Shoal  in  the  Philippines’  EEZ,  have  escalated.  Chinese  forces  have
gone  from  using  water  cannons  and  lasers  to  ramming  vessels  and
committing other acts of violence, including the use of bladed weap-
ons.† 232 In further attempts to use lawfare to assert China’s control
over Second Thomas Shoal, Beijing also called on the Philippines to
notify China in advance of conducting activities to and from Second
Thomas Shoal, a direct violation of the Philippines’ rights under in-
ternational  law.233 These  events,  which  frequently  involved  aggres-
sion by the CCG, maritime militia, and the PLA Navy, suggest Bei-
jing is seeking to establish a new status quo whereby it can control
or  deny  the  Philippines’  access  to  an  area  within  the  Philippines’

own  EEZ  under  the  guise  of  law  enforcement  activities.234  China’s
highly aggressive actions were likely emboldened by a Chinese reg-
ulation *  that  entered  into  force  in  June  2024,  granting  the  CCG
authority to seize and detain foreign vessels operating within “Chi-
nese jurisdiction”—despite the  fact that Second Thomas Shoal  does
not  lie  within  the  lawful  jurisdiction  of  China.235  Although  China
and  the  Philippines  agreed  to  lower  tensions  following  the  violent
encounters in June 2024 and established a hotline between the two
presidential  offices  to  prevent  new  confrontation  from  spiraling  out
of control, none of these efforts have altered Beijing’s aggressive be-
havior in the South China Sea.236 (For more on Philippine views of
China’s aggressive actions and on U.S. defense commitments to the
Philippines  in  the  South  China  Sea,  see  Chapter  8, “China’s  Evolv-
ing  Counter-Intervention  Capabilities  and  the  Role  of  Indo-Pacific
Allies.”)

 • On  March  5,  2024,  the  CCG  collided  with  a  Philippine  Coast
Guard vessel after carrying out “dangerous maneuvers” to block
the  Philippine  Coast  Guard  vessel  from  escorting  a  resupply
mission to Second Thomas Shoal.237 Hours later, two CCG ves-
sels shot water cannons at a Philippine supply boat in the area,
reportedly  injuring  four  people  onboard  and  shattering  three
panes  of  the  boat’s  windshield.238  The  CCG  released  a  state-
ment  blaming  the  Philippines  for  the  incidents.239  In  remarks
to  the  media  in  Australia  the  following  day,  Philippine  Presi-
dent  Ferdinand  Marcos  Jr.  expressed  alarm  at  the  continuing
dangerous maneuvers and actions against the Philippines while
clarifying that this incident did not necessitate an invocation of
the U.S.-Philippines Mutual Defense Treaty.240

 • On March 23, 2024, two CCG ships and two militia vessels sur-
rounded  a  wooden  Philippine  supply  boat  on  its  way  to  Second
Thomas  Shoal.241  The  CCG  ships  reportedly  fired  water  can-
nons  at  the  boat  for  almost  an  hour,  injuring  three  Philippine
crew members and disabling the boat.242 In the following days,
the  Philippines  summoned  China’s  ambassador  in  Manila  to
protest  the  aggressive  actions,  and  the  Philippine  Embassy  in
Beijing lodged a demarche with China’s Ministry of Foreign Af-
fairs.243 China’s embassy accused the Philippines of “deliberate
and  provocative”  actions  that  had  supposedly  “infringed  upon
China’s  sovereignty  and  maritime  rights,”  completely  ignoring
the  legally  binding  ruling  of  the  2016  Court  of Arbitration Tri-
bunal,  which  invalidated  any  Chinese  claim  to  special  rights
around Second Thomas Shoal.† 244

* China’s  Coast  Guard  Regulation  No.  3  appears  to  implement  the  2021  China  Coast  Guard
Law  which  contains  ambiguous  language  on  the  scope  of  CCG  authority  to  use  weapons  and
its  geographic  application.  In  analysis  conducted  by  U.S.  INDOPACOM’s  Joint  Operational  Law
Team, the regulation, which took effect on June 15, 2024, authorizes CCG commanders to detain
foreign vessels and persons in “waters under China’s jurisdiction” for up to 60 days. USINDOPA-

† The  tribunal  ruled  that  Second  Thomas  Shoal  is  a  low-tide  elevation—a  feature  that,  in  its
natural  state,  is  above  water  only  at  low  tide—and  thus  incapable  of  generating  any  maritime
zones  (such  as  a  territorial  sea,  EEZ,  or  continental  shelf)  of  its  own.  This  categorization,  com-
bined with the fact that the feature lies outside the legal territorial sea of any state, means it is

 • In  April  2024,  the  Philippines  task  force  on  South  China  Sea
issues said the CCG ships had harassed and damaged a Philip-
pine Coast Guard ship and a Philippine fisheries vessel headed
to  Scarborough  Shoal *  to  assist  Filipino  fishermen  in  the  ar-
ea.245  According  to  the  statement,  the  CCG  ships  used  water
cannons  against  both  of  the  Philippine  vessels  and  repeatedly
rammed the fisheries vessel.246

 • In May 2024, the CCG attempted to block the Philippine Coast
Guard  conducting  a  medical  evacuation  of  a  sick  member  of
the  country’s  armed  forces  from  Second  Thomas  Shoal.247  The
blocking  maneuvers  reportedly  continued  despite  calls  from
the  Philippine  Coast  Guard  explaining  the  humanitarian  na-
ture  of  the  mission.248  The  Philippine  Coast  Guard  ultimately
completed the mission in spite of China’s interference, which it
described as “barbaric and inhumane.” 249

 • On  June  17,  2024,  CCG  ships  intercepted  Philippine  vessels
attempting  to  deliver  supplies  to  Philippine  troops  stationed
at  Second  Thomas  Shoal,  instigating  a  violent  encounter  that
left  at  least  eight  Philippine  Navy  personnel  injured.250  CCG
personnel  boarded  the  Philippine  vessels,  carrying  with  them
bladed  weapons,  and  seized  all  Philippine  firearms  they  found
onboard.251  They  also  slashed  at  Philippine  rubber  boats,  re-
portedly  leaving  them  in  tatters.252  Philippine  personnel  who
resisted  were  reportedly  left  to  do  so  “with  their  bare  hands,”
and  one  Filipino  servicemember  lost  his  thumb  in  the  confron-
tation.253  The  violent  encounter  led  to  a  debate  among  West-
ern  observers  about  what  threshold  of  force  would  trigger  the
U.S.-Philippine mutual defense clause of the 1951 treaty.254
 • On  August  19,  2024,  vessels  of  the  CCG  and  Philippine  Coast
Guard  collided  near  Sabina  Shoal,†  causing  structural  damage

invalidate  any  claim  of  “territorial  sovereignty”  over  the  feature  (which  China  claims  over  all
features  in  the  Spratlys)  and  any  claim  to  maritime  zones  around  it. The  tribunal  further  ruled
that  Second  Thomas  Shoal  is  located  fully  within  the  EEZ  of  the  Philippines,  thereby  granting
the Philippines legal right to explore, exploit, conserve, and manage the natural resources in and
around  the  shoal—rights  it  found  China  to  have  violated. The  tribunal  determined  that  China’s
ambiguous  claim  to  “historic  rights”  in  the  South  China  Sea  is  baseless,  as  no  such  historic
rights are recognized under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), which China
has  signed.  Additionally,  the  tribunal  clarified  that  if  any  of  China’s  ambiguous  claims  were  to
amount  to  a  claim  over “internal  waters”  in  the  area,  such  claims  would  also  lack  any  legal  ba-
sis  in  UNCLOS. Thus,  the  only  rights  that  China’s  vessels  are  entitled  to  in  the  area  of  Second
Thomas  Shoal  are  the  standard  rights  afforded  to  all  foreign  vessels  within  another  country’s
EEZ.  USINDOPACOM  J06/SJA  TACAID  Series,  Topic:  Sierra  Madres,  Second  Thomas  Shoal,

* The  tribunal  ruled  that  Scarborough  Shoal  is  a  high-tide  feature  rightfully  classified  as  a
“rock”  under  UNCLOS,  meaning  it  is  entitled  to  a  12-nautical-mile  territorial  sea  but  not  to  its
own EEZ or continental shelf. The tribunal did not have jurisdiction to take a position on which
country  has  sovereignty  over  the  feature  itself.  The  tribunal  ruled  that  the  fisherfolk  of  both
countries  retain  a  degree  of  “traditional  fishing  rights”  in  the  area  that  were  not  extinguished
by  the  adoption  of  UNCLOS  or  by  the  feature’s  location  within  the  Philippines’  EEZ.  It  further
ruled  that  China  had  infringed  upon  the  rights  of  Filipino  fishermen  by  obstructing  all  fishing
by  Philippine  nationals.  Permanent  Court  of Arbitration,  The  South  China  Sea Arbitration  (The

pine National Security Council director general Jonathan Mala-
ya, the first Philippines coast guard vessel sustained a 13-centi-
meter hole after “aggressive” maneuvers by the CCG.256 Fifteen
minutes later, a second Philippine coast guard ship was report-
edly “rammed twice” by a CCG vessel and suffered “minor struc-
tural  damage.” 257  China’s  Ministry  of  Foreign  Affairs  refuted
the  Philippines’  reports,  claimed  the  Philippine  coast  guard
vessels entered “China’s territory” without permission from the
Chinese government, and accused the Philippine coast guard of
“deliberately  ramming  the  China  Coast  Guard  vessel  that  was
carrying out law enforcement operation[s].” 258

Regional Reactions to China’s Violent Behavior

China  attempted  to  justify  its  violent  actions  occurring  on  June
17,  2024  against  the  Philippines  by  illegally  claiming  jurisdiction
over the South China Sea, raising concern from countries in the re-
gion. China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs continued to act as if China
had  the  ability  to  enforce  its  domestic  laws  within  the  Philippines’
EEZ  and  blamed  the  incident  on  the  Philippines,  claiming  that  the
CCG  “only  took  necessary  control  measures  against  the  Philippine
vessels.” 259  On  the  day  of  the  June  17,  2024  incident,  the  spokes-
person  for  the  State  Department  asserted  that  the  United  States
“stands  with  its  ally  the  Philippines  and  condemns  the  escalatory
and irresponsible actions” by China to deny the Philippines its law-
ful  rights.260  He  also  reaffirmed  that  U.S.  commitments  under  the
U.S.-Philippines  Mutual  Defense Treaty  apply  to  armed  attacks  on
Philippine  armed  forces,  public  vessels,  or  aircraft—including  those
of  its  coast  guard—anywhere  in  the  South  China  Sea.261 The  Phil-
ippine  Department  of  National  Defense,  Office  of  the  National  Se-
curity  Advisor,  and  Department  of  Foreign  Affairs  released  a  joint
statement  on  June  24,  2024,  stating  that  the  Philippines  views  the
incident “not as a misunderstanding or an accident” but as “a delib-
erate  act  of  the  Chinese  officialdom”  and “an  act  of  aggressive  and
illegal  use  of  force”  while  also  noting  that  the  Philippines  “contin-
ue[s] to find peaceful solutions” to the issue.262 Japan, South Korea,
and  Australia  have  also  expressed  concerns  about  China’s  danger-
ous behavior in the South China Sea and its aggressive obstruction
of Philippine vessels.263

reported that crushed corals had been dumped on the reef, declar-
ing it “highly likely that the maritime features [of Sabina Shoal]
were  altered”  by  human  activity.266  According  to  a  statement
from  the  Office  of  the  President  of  the  Philippines,  the  dumping
of the corals represented the very early stages of a suspected arti-
ficial island-building effort by China.267 The Philippines institut-
ed  a  rotational  deployment  of  coast  guard  vessels  to  monitor  the
shoal,  noting  the  presence  of  PLA  Navy  vessels  and  helicopters,
CCG  ships,  Chinese  Maritime  Militia  vessels,  and  Chinese  re-
search vessels around the shoal at various times.268 China’s Min-
istry  of  Foreign  Affairs  dismissed  the  reports  as  “futile”  efforts
to  smear  China  and  “mislead  the  international  community.” 269
Not  all  experts  agree  on  whether  the  corals  indicate  an  ongoing
island-building  effort. According  to  Gregory  B.  Poling,  director  of
the  Southeast  Asia  program  and  Asia  Maritime  Transparency
Initiative  at  the  Center  for  Strategic  and  International  Studies,
“There is no evidence in commercially available satellite imagery
to  suggest  any  island  building  or  reclamation,  with  all  the  sand-
bars  in  question  remaining  the  same  average  size  for  the  last
decade or more.” 270

China Gray Zone Operations near Japan Intensify

China  has  steadily  ramped  up  its  pressure  on  Japan  around  the
Senkaku  Islands  in  the  East  China  Sea,  which  Japan  administers
but  which  China  claims  as  its  own  territory.  On  a  visit  to  the  East
China  Sea  Command  Headquarters  of  the  CCG  on  November  29,
2023,  Xi  told  the  CCG  to  “resolutely”  defend  China’s  sovereignty
claims in the area and that China “can only move forward, not back-
ward”  on  the  matter.271  According  to  Japanese  media  reports,  the
CCG subsequently drafted a plan to maintain a ship presence near
the  islands  every  day  of  2024.272  On  July  5,  2024,  the  Japanese
Coast  Guard  spokesman  reported  that  China  had  sailed  near  the
Japan-administered  Senkaku  Islands  and  within  Japan’s  EEZ  in
the East China Sea for a record 197 consecutive days.* 273

China’s  naval  presence  around  the  Senkaku  Islands  and  flights
near  Japanese  airspace  represented  a  significant  escalation  from
previous  activity.  According  to  the  Japanese  Coast  Guard,  in  June
2024,  three  CCG  vessels  entered  within  12  nautical  miles  of  the
Senkaku Islands and appeared to be armed with deck-mounted ma-
chine  guns.274  Japan’s  then-Prime  Minister  Fumio  Kishida  stated
that China’s “unilateral attempts to change the status quo are being
intensified,”  calling  the  situation  “a  grave  concern.” 275  Senior  level
exchanges  between  the  two  countries  have  not  impacted  the  tempo
of  China’s  East  China  Sea  activities,  as  the  Japanese  Coast  Guard
detected the four CCG ships a day after then-Prime Minister Kishi-

on May 26, 2024.276 China’s military has also begun to utilize UAVs
near  Japan’s  territorial  airspace,  a  move  without  historical  prece-
dent.277 On May 27, 2024, the Japan Air Self-Defense Force observed
a  PLA  reconnaissance  and  attack  drone  flying  over  the  East  China
Sea,  north  of  the  southwestern  Japanese  prefecture  of  Okinawa.278
On  June  4,  2024,  the  Air  Self-Defense  Force  scrambled  fighter  jets
to intercept another PLA reconnaissance and attack drone that flew
in international airspace near Okinawa.279 In August 2024, Japan’s
Defense  Ministry  said  a  PLA  Y-9  reconnaissance  aircraft  violated
the  country’s  territorial  airspace,  12  nautical  miles  from  the  coast
of Japanese territory on the eastern side of the Danjo Islands in the
East China Sea.280 The PLA continued to ramp up its presence the
following  month  when  a  Chinese  aircraft  carrier  entered  Japan’s
contiguous  zone,*  reportedly  for  the  first  time,  by  sailing  between
the southern Yonaguni and Iriomote islands.281

China Expands Persuasion Efforts in the Pacific Islands

China  continued  and  expanded  its  campaign  to  persuade  Pacific
Island  states  to  deepen  their  reliance  on  China  and  adopt  Beijing’s
preferred  policies  on  a  range  of  issues,  further  increasing  concerns
that  China  could  seek  to  use  its  relationships  in  the  region  to  con-
strain U.S. security partnerships.† In November 2023, Special Envoy
for Pacific Island Countries Affairs of the Chinese Government Qian
Bo  visited  the  Cook  Islands  to  participate  in  the  Pacific  Island  Fo-
rum Leaders Meeting and also took the opportunity to meet bilater-
ally with national leaders from across the region.282 In his speech at
the forum, Representative Qian continued to advertise China as an
economic  partner  by  announcing  new  development  assistance  mea-
sures  and  arguing  that “Chinese  modernization”  and “high-quality”
BRI  cooperation  would  bring  major  opportunities  for  Pacific  Island
countries.283  On  the  sidelines  of  the  forum,  he  met  with  Cook  Is-
lands Prime Minister, and Chair of the Pacific Islands Forum, Mark
Stephen  Brown,  who  reportedly  reiterated  the  government’s  com-
mitment to Beijing’s One China principle.284 According to reporting
by China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Representative Qian also met
with participating leaders from Fiji, Kiribati, Niue, Samoa, and the
Solomon Islands over the course of his stay in the country and con-
ducted “friendly  exchanges”  with  leaders  of  the  Federated  States  of
Micronesia, Papua New Guinea, Tonga, and Vanuatu.285

China  made  new  efforts  to  strengthen  its  relationship  with  the
political leadership of the Solomon Islands in 2024, seeking to main-
tain the advantageous position it had enjoyed under outgoing Prime
Minister Manasseh Sogavare. In January 2024, Xinhua news agency

† China’s  pursuit  of  deepened  relations  and  especially  security  agreements  in  the  region  has
generated  concern  in  the  past  about  the  leverage  it  could  give  China  to  deny  U.S.  security  ac-
cess.  For  example,  after  signing  a  security  agreement  with  China  in  2022,  the  government  of
the Solomon Islands refused to grant permission for routine visits by U.S. and UK vessels in its
ports.  U.S.-China  Economic  and  Security  Review  Commission,  2022  Annual  Report  to  Congress,

publicized remarks by then Prime Minister Sogavare, then running
for  reelection,*  in  which  he  not  only  argued  that  his  government
had  made  the  right  choice  in  severing  diplomatic  relations  with
Taiwan  in  2019  but  also  parroted  China’s  false  narrative  that  UN
Resolution 2758 obligated every UN member state to recognize Tai-
wan as part of China.286 (For more on China’s misrepresentation of
UN  Resolution  2758,  see  Chapter  9, “Taiwan.”)  In  early April  2024,
Representative  Qian  visited  the  Solomon  Islands  and  met  with  the
country’s  Permanent  Secretary  of  the  Ministry  of  Foreign  Affairs
and  External  Trade  Collin  Beck.287  In  an  example  of  China’s  use
of subnational diplomacy to advance its goals, he also made a dedi-
cated  trip  to  Malaita  Province,  where  he  met  Premier  Martin  Fini,
visited a community school, and attended the signing ceremony of a
memorandum of understanding on establishing a sister province re-
lationship between Malaita and Jiangsu.† 288 Later in April, China’s
state-backed  media  seized  the  opportunity  of  the  Solomon  Islands’
parliamentary  elections  to  spread  false  narratives  about  U.S.  for-
eign policy objectives in the region and about China’s supposed com-
mitment  to  not  interfere  in  other  countries’  internal  affairs  while
again  touting  the  development  opportunities  China  would  bring  to
the  country.289  Following  the  election,  Solomon  Islands  lawmakers
selected  as  the  new  prime  minister  former  Foreign  Minister  Jere-
miah  Manele,  who  pledged  to  continue  the  Pacific  Island  country’s
international  policy  of  close  relations  with  China.290  In  early  July
2024,  China  invited  Prime  Minister  Manele  to  meet  with  Gener-
al  Secretary  Xi  in  Beijing,  where  they  released  a  joint  statement
outlining  planned  future  cooperation.291  Notably,  the  statement  in-
cluded  a  commitment  by  China  to  continue  sending  “police  liaison
teams” to the country, likely indicating continuity of the police coop-
eration agreement that China signed with the Sogavare government
in 2023.292

The CCP in 2024 also undertook substantial efforts to deepen polit-
ical connections in Vanuatu with an emphasis on solidifying support
for  China  on  key  political  issues  such  as Taiwan.  In April  and  May
2024, International Liaison Department Director Liu held a series of
meetings with representatives from Vanuatu’s various political par-
ties.293  In  these  meetings  and  other  venues,  Director  Liu  promoted
China’s economic development opportunities and sought support for
China’s “core  interests  and  major  concerns.” 294 As  a  demonstration
of one such core interest, readouts from the party-to-party meetings
consistently mentioned the commitment of Vanuatu and of each in-
dividual political party to Beijing’s One China principle, suggesting

* In  the  runup  to  the  Solomon  Islands  election,  news  media  reported  that  incumbent  Prime
Minister Sogavare unsurprisingly favored closer ties with China, while opposition parties report-
edly  favored  closer  ties  with  Western  countries,  including  Australia,  and  had  even  stated  that
they may scrap or hold a referendum on the security deal that Sogavare’s government had signed
with China, if elected. Reuters, “Explainer: China, Health System Top Issues as Solomon Islands

† Preexisting  sister  province  relationships  between  China  and  the  Solomon  Islands  include
between  Isabel  Province  and  Shandong  Province  (established  2023)  and  between  Guadalcanal
Province and Guangdong Province (reestablished 2021). According to news coverage of the event
by  the  Solomon  Islands  government,  there  were  “ongoing  discussions”  by  other  provinces  inter-
ested in establishing similar relationships with China. Solomon Islands Government, PRC Pacific

Beijing  may  continue  finding  support  for  its Taiwan  agenda  even  if
the  party  in  power  were  to  change.* 295  The  meeting  readouts  also
referenced “governance experience” and “governance capacity build-
ing,”  suggesting  efforts  by  the  CCP  to  promote  its  authoritarian
practices as it has in the Solomon Islands.296 Director Liu described
China’s relations with Vanuatu as “a microcosm of China’s relations
with  Pacific  Island  countries,”  suggesting  that  China’s  government
sees Vanuatu as a willing partner for its objectives in the region.297
In early July 2024, China completed the construction of a new presi-
dential palace and finance ministry building in Vanuatu, in addition
to renovations to Vanuatu’s foreign affairs department building.† 298
Shortly thereafter, China invited Prime Minister of Vanuatu Charlot
Salwai to meet with General Secretary Xi in Beijing, where the two
leaders released a joint statement.299

China’s efforts in the region seem to be paying off. In 2024, China
secured a degree of rhetorical support from its established partners
the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu, from Fiji, and from the Federated
States  of  Micronesia,  one  of  the  three  Pacific  Island  countries  with
a  Compact  of  Free  Association  (COFA)  agreement  with  the  United
States. (For more on the COFA agreements, see Chapter 8, “China’s
Evolving Counter-Intervention Capabilities and the Role of Indo-Pa-
cific Allies.”) After separate meetings between Xi and the respective
heads  of  state  from  these  four  countries,  they  released  joint  state-
ments endorsing a wide range of political and geopolitical priorities
for  China,  including  several  that  are  oriented  to  undercut  and  dis-
credit the United States and its allies.300

 • First,  each  of  the  four  statements  included  support  for  China’s
political priorities and sovereignty claims to some degree. Each
described  Taiwan  as  “an  inalienable  part  of  China’s  territory,”
and  all  but  Fiji  opposed “Taiwan  independence”  and  supported
efforts by the Chinese government to “realize national reunifica-
tion.” 301 All but Fiji also included mentions of Hong Kong, Xinji-
ang, and Tibet, with the Federated States of Micronesia and the
Solomon Islands additionally stating that they “firmly support”
China’s  position  on  these  issues,  and Vanuatu  describing  them
as  “internal  matters  for  China  to  deal  with.” 302  The  Solomon
Islands and Vanuatu also mentioned “issues related to . . .human
rights,”  with  the  former  stating  they  “firmly  support”  China’s
position  and Vanuatu  again  describing  human  rights  as  an  in-
ternal  matter  for  China.303  Finally,  both  the  Solomon  Islands
and  Vanuatu  statements  added  that  their  government  “fully
understands and supports” China’s position on the South China
Sea.304

 • Second,  each  of  the  four  statements  endorsed  the  set  of  diplo-
matic slogans China has emphasized in 2024 to contrast its os-
tensible international leadership with that of the United States.

* Following the Taiwan election, the government of Vanuatu publicly reaffirmed its position that
“Taiwan is an integral part of the People’s Republic of China’s territory” and called on the inter-
national  community  to  respect  China’s  supposed  sovereignty  over Taiwan.  Daily  Post, “Vanuatu
Gov’t Reaffirms Recognition of ‘One China Policy,’ ” January 16, 2024.

This  included  support  not  only  for  Xi’s  community  of  common
human  destiny  and  his  three  global  initiatives  but  also  “equal
and orderly multipolar[ization]” and “inclusive economic global-
ization.” 305  All  four  statements  also  stated  opposition  to  “he-
gemonism  and  power  politics,”  which  China  attributes  to  the
United States.306

 • Third,  while  all  four  statements  reiterated  a  commitment  to
upholding  the  international  nuclear  non-proliferation  regime,
the  Federated  States  of  Micronesia,  the  Solomon  Islands,  and
Vanuatu  also  included  additional  language  on  nuclear  issues
that  could  be  interpreted  as  a  veiled  criticism  of  both  Japan’s
discharge of treated water from the Fukushima power station *
and  the  operation  of  nuclear-powered  submarines  by  the  Unit-
ed States, the UK, and eventually Australia under the AUKUS
agreement.† 307  (For  more  on  the  AUKUS  partnership  and  the

do-Pacific Allies.”)

China Downplays Maritime and Territorial Disputes with Vietnam

Over the past year, China and Vietnam have undertaken wide-rang-
ing cooperation and professed to have constructive political relations,
despite  the  two  countries’  unresolved  territorial-maritime  disputes
in  the  South  China  Sea.  In  December  2023,  General  Secretary  Xi
and General Secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam Nguyen
Phu  Trong  released  a  joint  statement  declaring  the  establishment
of  a  “China-Vietnam  community  of  common  destiny.” 308  The  joint
statement  covered  a  wide  range  of  issues,  including  strengthened
party-to-party  ties;  greater  military  exchanges;  expanded  coopera-
tion on law enforcement, regime security, and intelligence; deepened
economic  ties;  and  support  for  China’s  global  initiatives.309  It  also
contained  a  lengthy  section  on “better  management  and  settlement
of  differences”  which  focused  on  managing  disputes  in  the  South
China  Sea.310  Analysts  note  that  the  agreement  closely  followed
the  upgrade  of  U.S.-Vietnam  relations  to  a  comprehensive  strategic
partnership  three  months  prior,  and  Vietnam’s  officials  reportedly
characterize  the  further  development  of  relations  with  China  as  a
“strategic choice” and part of a “diversified foreign policy.” 311 In early
April 2024, General Secretary Xi met with Chairman of the Nation-
al Assembly of Vietnam Vuong Dinh Hue in Beijing and noted that
implementation of the agreement was proceeding well from China’s
perspective.312  Xi  and  Prime  Minister  Pham  Minh  Chinh  then  met
in Beijing in June 2024, where Xi again stated that cooperation was
progressing  “smoothly.” 313  Prime  Minister  Chinh  reportedly  voiced
opposition  for  “the  politicization  of  economic,  trade,  and  technolog-

ical  issues”  and  claimed  that  Vietnam’s  relations  with  China  “will
not be disrupted by external provocations and interference.” 314

It  is  notable  that  Vietnam  has  managed  to  maintain  cordial  re-
lations  with  China  despite  Vietnam’s  on-going  construction  in  the
South  China  Sea.  Vietnam’s  expansion  of  its  occupied  features  in
the Spratly Islands has gone uncontested this year by China’s Navy,
Coast  Guard,  or  Maritime  Militia,  a  sharp  contrast  to  Beijing’s  re-
sponse  to  the  Philippines  activities  at  Second  Thomas  Shoal.315
According  to  the  Asia  Maritime  Transparency  Initiative,  between
November  2023  and  June  7,  2024,  Vietnam  has  created  692  new
acres  of  land  across  a  total  of  ten  features,  a  significant  expansion
of  its  outposts  in  the  Spratly  Islands.316 Vietnam’s  activities  in  the
South  China  Sea  do  not  appear  to  have  impacted  defense  and  se-
curity  cooperation  with  China.  In  early  December  2023,  Minister
Wang  and  Vietnamese  Foreign  Minister  Bui  Thanh  Son  reportedly
agreed  to  “jointly  maintain  peace  and  stability  at  sea.” 317  In  April
2024, Chinese and Vietnamese coast guards completed a joint patrol
in  the  Beibu  Gulf.* 318 According  to  Chinese  state  media  reporting,
an  official  statement  heralds  the  joint  patrol  as  a  model  for “mari-
time law enforcement in the South China Sea” adding that practical
cooperation with the Vietnamese to properly handle maritime emer-
gencies will continue.319 Also in April, the defense ministers of Chi-
na  and Vietnam  announced  the  establishment  of  a  hotline  between
the  Vietnamese  Navy  and  the  PLA  Southern  Theater  Command,
framing the agreement as part of their efforts to improve maritime
cooperation under their community of common destiny.320

China’s state media used the agreement as an opportunity to con-
trast Vietnam and the Philippines, arguing that Vietnam had right-
ly judged that its “common interests [with China] far outweigh [its]
differences”  whereas  the  Philippines  had  chosen  a  so-called  path  of
“radical  actions”  and  provocation  backed  by  the  United  States.321
Western  analysts  have  assessed  that  Beijing’s  different  approaches
towards the Philippines and Vietnam may be influenced by the two
countries’  different  approaches  to  formal  alliances  with  the  United
States  and  publicly  shaming  China’s  coercive  behavior.322  China’s
comparably  low-key  response  to  Vietnam’s  activities  in  the  South
China  Sea  may  in  part  showcase  Beijing’s  preference  for  countries
to  bilaterally  manage  disputes  with  China  privately  and  publicly
demonstrate support and cooperation for China’s stated foreign pol-
icy objectives.323

Nevertheless,  in  late  September  2024,  law  enforcement  authori-
ties from China engaged in a violent altercation with a civilian ves-
sel  from Vietnam  in  the  South  China  Sea.  On  September  29,  2024,
according  to  Vietnamese  accounts,  two  patrol  ships  from  China’s
Maritime  Safety  Administration  Sansha  City  United  Law  Enforce-
ment  Unit  were  deployed  to  interdict  a  Vietnamese  fishing  vessel
near  the  Paracels.† 324  Local Vietnamese  media  reported  that  up  to

* The three-day joint patrol included observing and inspecting fishing boats from both countries
while  patrolling  along  planned  routes.  China  Military  Online,  “China,  Vietnam  Coast  Guards

† China, Vietnam,  and Taiwan  claim  sovereignty  over  the  Paracels;  however,  China  effectively
controls  them  and  has  constructed  20  outposts  in  the  area.  In  addition  to  claiming  sovereignty
over  the  features  themselves,  China  also  maintains  a  straight  baseline  claim  around  them  that
is  inconsistent  with  international  law,  illegally  claiming  the  waters  between  them  as  China’s
internal waters. Center for Strategic and International Studies, Asia Maritime Transparency Ini-

40  officers  from  China’s  Maritime  Safety  Administration  boarded
the Vietnamese civilian fishing vessel with metal rods and attacked
ten Vietnamese  fishermen,  resulting  in  severe  injuries  to  four  fish-
ermen, some of whom suffered broken limbs.325 China’s Ministry of
Foreign Affairs  defended  the  actions  of  China’s  authorities  as “pro-
fessional and restrained,” claiming that “no injuries were found” and
the  Vietnamese  fishing  boats  were  illegally  fishing  in  the  relevant
waters  without  the  permission  of  the  Beijing  government.326  In  re-
sponse, Vietnam’s  foreign  ministry  confirmed  the  incident,  lodged  a
protest with China’s embassy in Vietnam, and asserted that Chinese
law enforcement officials did in fact beat Vietnamese fisherman and
confiscate their fishing equipment.327 It remains to be seen whether
this incident represents a new trend.

China Deepens Exchanges and Military Access in Cambodia

In 2024, China and Cambodia continued to deepen ties following
Cambodia’s  leadership  transition  from  then-Prime  Minister  Hun
Sen to his son General Hun Manet last August.328 In April 2024,
Minister Wang  visited  Cambodia  and  met  with  high-level  leader-
ship  including  the  king,  prime  minister,  deputy  prime  minister,
and  senate  chairman.329  The  two  sides  reaffirmed  their  pursuit
of a “China-Cambodia community of common destiny,” which they
had  declared  in  a  joint  statement  in  2023,  and  Minister  Wang
described the arrangement between the two countries as “a model
for building a new type of international relations.” 330 In addition
to  expanded  cooperation  on  exports,  infrastructure,  agriculture,
and  tourism,  the  two  governments  reportedly  agreed  to  deepen
exchanges  in  “state  governance,”  to  jointly  combat  transnation-
al  crimes,  and  to  “strengthen  defense  cooperation”  through  con-
tinued  joint  exercises  and  training,  medical  services  cooperation,
and  mine  clearing.331 They  also  declared  their  intention  to  coop-
erate  under  the  framework  of  Xi’s  Global  Development,  Security,
and Civilization Initiatives.332 In May 2024, China and Cambodia
also  held  their  annual  Golden  Dragon  military  exercise *  focused
on  counter-terrorism  and  humanitarian  relief.333

China  has  expanded  on  its  activities  at  Cambodia’s  Ream  Na-
val  Base  by  maintaining  a  consistent  PLA  Navy  presence  there
since  December  2023.† 334 While  the  Cambodian  government  has
insisted  that  the  presence  of  the  two  Chinese  Navy  corvettes  is
not  “permanent,”  the  two  Chinese  warships  have  been  the  only
ships  docked  at  the  new  Chinese-built  pier.335  The  Cambodian
Commander  of  Ream,  Mey  Dina,  told  the  New  York  Times  the

tiative,  “Reading  between  the  Lines:  The  Next  Spratly  Legal  Dispute,”  March  21,  2019;  Center

China-American Studies; National Bureau of Asian Research, “Country Profile from the Maritime

† China’s  Ministry  of  National  Defense  has  denied  claims  that  Cambodia  has  given  the  PLA
exclusive  rights  to  use  some  facilities  at  Ream.  In  2022,  a  spokesperson  for  China’s  Ministry  of
National Defense stated the upgrade and renovation project of Ream Naval Base was an aid proj-
ect undertaken by China. China Military Online, “China-Cambodia Ream Naval Base Upgrading

Chinese  warships  were  docked  for  “training  only.” 336  In  June,
Cambodia’s  leadership  reportedly  told  U.S.  Defense  Secretary
Austin  that  China’s  military  activities  at  Ream  were  intended
to  help  Cambodia  modernize  its  military,  not  to  establish  the  lo-
cation  as  a  permanent  base  for  China’s  forces.337  According  to
Thomas  Shugart,  an  adjunct  senior  fellow  at  the  Center  for  a
New American Security, the facilities that have been built by Chi-
na  at  Ream  look  like  “a  medium-size  naval  base  with  facilities
to  support  training,  maintenance,  personnel  support,  supply,  and
other functions,” all of which could make it a resupply station for
the  PLA  Navy  similar  to  that  at  Djibouti.338

China  Does  Little  to  Hold  North  Korea  Accountable  for  Escalatory

Activities

China avoided condemning North Korea’s provocative military ac-
tivities *  in  violation  of  UN  Security  Council  resolutions.†  Instead,
China’s  UN  Ambassador  Fu  Cong  issued  generic  warnings  against
raising tensions on the Korean Peninsula, particularly in the form of
planned large-scale joint military exercise conducted by other coun-
tries.339  China  has  also  fallen  short  in  fulfilling  its  international
obligations to implement UN Security Council resolutions on North
Korea  to  disrupt  its  nuclear  and  ballistic  missile  programs.340  For
instance, Beijing has failed to stop North Korea from evading sanc-
tions  measures  by  using  China’s  territorial  waters  to  facilitate  the
trade of sanctioned petroleum products and has downplayed the ac-
tivities  of  Chinese  companies  that  have  provided,  transacted  with,
or exported goods to North Korea.341 China’s military also continues
to  harass  foreign  militaries  conducting  missions  in  the  East  China
Sea  in  support  of  a  multinational  coalition  enforcing  UN  sanctions
on North Korea.342

Furthermore,  China  has  done  nothing  to  condemn  the  deepen-
ing  ties  between  North  Korea  and  Russia,  including  North  Korea’s
willingness to supply Russia with ammunition and ballistic missiles
as  well  as  the  signing  of  a  defense  pact  between  Russia  and  North
Korea on June 19, 2024.‡ 343 Under the terms of the pact, North Ko-
rea and Russia “shall immediately provide military and other assis-
tance” to the other party if it “falls into a state of war due to armed
invasion,”  establish  mechanisms  to “strengthen  defense  capabilities
to  prevent  war,”  and  facilitate  Russian  assistance  to  North  Korea’s
nuclear  energy  and  space  programs,  all  of  which  violate  UN  secu-
rity council resolutions.344 Instead, Beijing has sought to avoid any
semblance  of  association  with  the  Russian-North  Korean  military
relationship.345

* North  Korea  claimed  at  the  end  of  June  2024  that  it  had  successfully  tested  a  new  ballistic
missile  capable  of  carrying  a  4.5-ton  warhead.  Jack  Kim,  “North  Korea  Says  It  Tested  Ballistic
Missile Capable of Carrying Super-Large Warhead,” Reuters, July 1, 2024.

† UN  Security  Council  Resolution  1695  passed  in  2006  calls  on  North  Korea  to  suspend  activ-
ities  related  to  its  ballistic  missile  program,  and  subsequent  resolutions  condemn  North  Korea
for  pursuing  nuclear  weapons  and  ballistic  missiles  instead  of  the  welfare  of  its  people.  Kelsey
Davenport,  “UN  Security  Council  Resolutions  on  North  Korea,”  Arms  Control  Association,  Jan-
uary 2022.

‡ In June 2024, a South Korean broadcaster cited an anonymous Republic of Korea government
official who claimed that North Korea planned to dispatch military engineers to aid construction
efforts in the Russian-controlled Donetsk region. However, these reports appear to be rumors as
North Korea has made no such announcement. Shreyas Reddy, “Fact Check: North Korea Has Not
Announced Plans to Send Troops to Ukraine—Yet,” NK News, June 27, 2024.

China’s Transactional Approach in the Middle East Supports

Its Interests

In  late  2023  and  2024,  China  pursued  a  selective  and  transac-
tional  approach  to  relations  in  the  Middle  East  and  demonstrated
willingness  to  exploit  regional  tensions  for  geopolitical  gain.  Bei-
jing  made  several  diplomatic  overtures  to  paint  itself  as  a  conflict
mediator  between  Israel  and  Hamas,  but  these  have  failed  to  re-
sult  in  substantive  steps  advancing  a  resolution  to  the  conflict.346
At  the  same  time,  China  has  sought  to  appeal  to  Arab  states  and
has offered support for Iran to advance its own interests.347 China’s
failure  to  clearly  and  unequivocally  condemn  the  Hamas  terrorist
attack against Israel on October 7, 2023, exposed China’s use of the
conflict  to  further  align  itself  with  Arab  countries  and  other  coun-
tries  in  the “Global  South.” 348  Despite  the  PLA’s  stated  mission  in
the region being focused on anti-piracy, it also did not contribute to
coalition  efforts  to  protect  maritime  shipping  from  Iranian-backed
Houthi terrorist attacks on commercial shipping in the Red Sea.349
However,  China  did  denounce  Israel’s  assassination  of  Hamas  ter-
rorist chief Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran.350 (For more on China’s stra-
tegic  interests  and  activities  in  the  Middle  East,  see  Chapter  5,
“China and the Middle East.”)

China Seeks Benefits from Wide-Ranging Contacts in African

Countries

China  began  the  year  with  a  push  to  showcase  its  diverse  and
deepening ties in Africa as a key indicator of China’s supposed glob-
al diplomatic leadership. For the 34th consecutive year, China used
the minister of foreign affairs’ first overseas visit of the year to high-
light relations with the countries of Africa as a core part of China’s
international affairs.351 Minister Wang traveled first to Egypt* and
Tunisia  in  North  Africa,  then  to  Togo  and  Côte  d’Ivoire  in  West-
ern  Africa,  meeting  with  both  the  president  and  foreign  minister
of  each  country.352  China’s  official  readouts  assert  a  commonality
of  interests,  often  promoting  Xi’s  three  major  global  initiatives  and
highlighting  areas  of  potential  cooperation  (variously,  trade,  infra-
structure,  energy,  agricultural  technology,  AI,  healthcare,  invest-
ment,  and  development).353  China  also  sought  to  benefit  from  low-
er-profile party-to-party meetings, especially in central and southern
Africa.  Between  January  and  May  2024,  the  CCP’s  International
Liaison Department met with representatives of political parties in
Rwanda, Lesotho, Malawi, Burundi, Equatorial Guinea, and Namib-
ia.354 Readouts of these meetings echo many of the same claims and
topics as the readouts from the meetings with government officials,
while  in  some  cases  they  reveal  China’s  ongoing  efforts  to  promote
the CCP’s authoritarian governance model.355

The 2024 Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FO-
CAC),  held  in  Beijing  from  September  4  to  6,  provided  China  with
a  high-profile  opportunity  to  press  its  case  for  global  leadership  in
Africa.  Representatives  from  53  of  54  African  countries  attended
the  triennial  gathering,  with  the  lone  exception  of  Eswatini,  which
maintains  diplomatic  relations  with  Taiwan.356  Delegates  to  the

2024 FOCAC summit approved the Beijing Action Plan (2025–2027),
in which Beijing promised to provide Africa with approximately $50
billion (renminbi [RMB] 360 billion) in financial support during the
next  three  years,  including  $30  billion  (RMB  210  billion)  in  loans
as  well  as  other  forms  of  aid  and  investment,  such  as  $140  million
(RMB 1 billion) in military aid.357 On the one hand, China’s pledge
to  provide  about  $10  billion  annually  in  loans  to  African  countries
over  the  next  three  years  represents  a  significant  increase  relative
to  the  recent  past.  On  the  other  hand,  the  value  of  the  promised
new  loans  remains  far  less  than  China’s  lending  to  African  coun-
tries during the peak years of BRI (2013–2018), when Chinese loans
often  exceeded  $15  billion  per  year.358  Some  of  the  promised  new
funding reflects the priorities of China’s Global Development Initia-
tive,  which  emphasizes  small-scale  projects  addressing  issues  such
as  climate  change  and  poverty,  rather  than  large  infrastructure.359
At the FOCAC summit, China vowed to help fund 1,000 “small and
beautiful” projects to “improve people’s livelihood” in Africa and en-
courage greater Chinese investment in solar, wind, and other green
energy  initiatives  across  the  continent.360 At  the  same  time,  China
continued  to  provide  loans  for  more  traditional  large-scale  infra-
structure  projects,  including  $1  billion  for  a  railway  in  Nigeria.361
Significantly,  China’s  financial  assistance  to  African  countries  will
also  include  yuan-denominated  loans,  and  the  Beijing  Action  Plan
explicitly  calls  for  “expanding  the  use  of  the  RMB  in  Africa”—part
of  China’s  wider  goal  to  internationalize  the  RMB.362  (For  more  on
internationalization of the RMB, see Chapter 7, “China’s New Mea-
sures for Control, Mobilization, and Resilience.”)

While  the  FOCAC  summit  was  replete  with  rhetorical  nods  to
China’s  global  leadership  and  thinly  veiled  criticisms  of  the  United
States  and  its  allies,  it  also  laid  bare  problems  and  imbalances  in
the China-Africa relationship. The summit declaration includes lan-
guage  explicitly  reaffirming  that  “Taiwan  is  an  inalienable  part  of
China’s territory” and supporting “all efforts by the Chinese govern-
ment  to  achieve  national  reunification.” 363  In  an  attempt  to  frame
China-Africa  ties  within  the  context  of  China’s  larger  vision  for  an
alternative  global  order,  the  Beijing  Action  Plan  is  suffused  with
references to China’s preferred diplomatic principles, such as “equal
and orderly multipolarization” and “beneficial and inclusive econom-
ic  globalization,”  and  it  refers  to  China  and  Africa  as  “representa-
tives of the Global South.” 364 The action plan also repeated Beijing’s
frequent  criticisms  of  “unilateralism,  protectionism,  and  maximum
pressure”  as  well  as  “erecting  walls  and  barriers”  and  “decoupling
and  supply  chain  disruption,”  criticisms  that  are  largely  directed
at  the  United  States.365  Nevertheless,  the  FOCAC  summit  failed
to  address  several  pressing  concerns  about  China-Africa  relations,
particularly  with  regard  to  debt  and  market  access.  The  renewed
expansion  of  Chinese  lending  to  African  countries  has  exacerbated
concerns  over  debt  sustainability,  especially  considering  the  lack  of
transparency in the Chinese lending model.366 The FOCAC summit
also  revealed  China’s  lack  of  progress  on  promises  to  import  more
products  from Africa. At  the  2021  summit,  Xi  had  vowed  to  import
$300 billion worth of African goods over three years.367 China failed
to reach this target, and in his address to the 2024 summit, Xi made

138

only  vague  promises  to “unilaterally  expand”  access  to  the  Chinese
market.368

China  Elevates  Diplomatic  Outreach  to  Countries  in  Latin

America and the Caribbean

China  sought  to  deepen  its  diplomatic  and  political  engagement
with countries in Latin America and the Caribbean in 2024 as part
of  its  effort  to  cast  itself  as  a  leader  of  what  it  refers  to  as  the
“Global South.” Most notably and for the first time, after its regular
commencement in Africa, Foreign Minister Wang’s first overseas trip
of  the  year  also  included  visits  to  two  countries  in  Latin  America
and  the  Caribbean,*  namely  Brazil  and  Jamaica.† 369  In  meetings
throughout  the  year,  China’s  diplomats  tried  to  present  China  as  a
key  partner  for  economic  development  opportunities  and  a  partner
who  would  work  with  Latin  American  and  Caribbean  countries  to
safeguard  their  interests  internationally.370  Chinese  officials  also
conducted  party-to-party  exchanges  in  Mexico  (multiparty  par-
liamentary  delegation),  El  Salvador  (New  Ideas  Party),  and  Cuba
(Communist Party of Cuba) seeking to promote China’s internation-
al interests.371

China  sought  to  deepen  political  exchanges  with  Brazil  and  fur-
ther efforts to counterbalance the United States and its allies, with
some  success.  During  his  visit  to  Brazil  in  January  2024,  Minis-
ter  Wang  met  Brazil’s  President  Luiz  Inácio  Lula  and  pushed  for
strengthening  what  he  called  the  two  countries’  “strategic  align-
ment.” 372  Chinese  government  readouts  assert  that  the  meetings
also discussed trade, investment, BRICS, and “state governance.” 373
Exchanging  governance  experience  was  a  theme,  as  well,  from  the
seventh meeting between the CCP and the Brazilian Workers Party
held  in April  2024.374  In  May  2024,  Director  Liu  met  with  Brazil’s
deputy  foreign  minister  in  Beijing,  seeking  the  country’s  potential
collaboration  to  reform  global  governance  in  multilateral  mecha-
nism such as BRICS, the China Community of Latin American and
Caribbean  States  (CELAC)  Forum,  and  the  G20.375  China’s  efforts
in  Brazil  appear  to  have  had  some  success.  In  May  2024,  the  two
countries presented a joint plan for ending the war in Ukraine that
did  not  acknowledge  Russia’s  aggression.376  Instead,  it  opposed
“dividing  the  world  into  isolated  political  or  economic  groups”  and
made  a  broad  call  seemingly  unrelated  to  the  conflict  itself  to  “en-
hance  international  cooperation  on  energy,  currency,  finance,  trade,
food  security  and  the  security  of  critical  infrastructure”—all  policy
areas  in  which  China  seeks  to  deepen  ties  with  other  countries  to
counterbalance the United States.377

Concerns  about  distortions  caused  by  China’s  economic  model
may  be  growing,  however.  Chinese  companies  have  recently  en-
joyed  significant  relative  growth  in  “new  infrastructure”  industries
in  the  region  such  as  information  and  communication  technology,

* A  Chinese  state  media  commentator  argued  that  the  visits  were  a  deliberate  effort  to  raise
the profile of a region that is “more integrated into the Western system” compared to the rest of
the “Global South” and where China’s diplomacy has comparatively lagged as a result. Pan Deng,

high-end  manufacturing,  renewable  energy,  and  EVs,  and  the  first
half of 2024 saw a flood of Chinese EVs into Brazilian and Mexican
markets.378 To  support  its  domestic  industry,  in  January  2024  Bra-
zil reinstated tariffs on imported EVs starting at 10 percent, which
then increased to 18 percent by July and are set to reach 35 percent
by July 2026.379 In April 2024, Mexico’s government ceased provid-
ing  incentives  such  as  tax  cuts  and  low-cost  public  land  for  EVs  in
the  country.380 The  United  States  and  Mexico  also  announced  joint
tariffs  of  25  percent  on  steel  not  melted  and  poured  in  the  United
States,  Mexico,  or  Canada  and  tariffs  of  10  percent  on  aluminum
from China, Russia, Belarus, and Iran.381

2024;  Jay Tarriela  (@jaytaryela), “On  May  19,  2024,  in  support  of  the Armed  Forces
of the Philippines, the Commandant of the Philippine Coast Guard, Admiral Ronnie
Gil Gavan decisively deployed the High Speed Response Boat (HSRB) from Buliluyan
Port  to  rendezvous  with  the  Philippine  Navy  Rigid  Hull  Inflatable  Boat  (RHIB)  car-
rying sick personnel for immediate medical evacuation. During our attempt to bring
the  PCG  HSRB  alongside  the  PN  RHIB  at  the  rendezvous  point,  we  were  harassed
by vessels and small boats from the China Coast Guard through blocking operations.
Despite  informing  the  Chinese  Coast  Guard  via  radio  and  public  address  system
about  the  humanitarian  nature  of  our  mission  for  medical  evacuation,  they  still  en-
gaged  in  dangerous  maneuvers  and  even  intentionally  rammed  the  PN  RHIB  while
transporting  the  sick  personnel.  The  barbaric  and  inhumane  behavior  displayed  by
the  China  Coast  Guard  has  no  place  in  our  society.  What  should  have  been  a  sim-
ple  medical  evacuation  operation  was  subjected  to  harassment,  with  the  excessive
deployment  of  two  China  Coast  Guard  vessels  (21551  and  21555),  two  small  boats,
and  two  rubber  boats. Their  actions  clearly  demonstrated  their  intention  to  prevent
the  sick  personnel  from  receiving  the  proper  medical  attention  he  urgently  needed.
Despite  the  challenges  posed  by  the  interference  from  the  CCG,  the  PN  and  PCG

158

displayed remarkable cooperation, professionalism, and determination. They success-
fully  outmaneuvered  the  numerous  CCG  assets  and  completed  the  transfer  of  the
sick  personnel,  ensuring  their  safe  arrival  at  Buliluyan  Port.  At  1515H  on  19  May
2024,  the  sick  AFP  personnel  was  transported  to  the  nearest  hospital  and  received
immediate medical attention,” X (formerly Twitter), June 6, 2024, 8:14 p.m.

CHAPTER 3: U.S.-CHINA COMPETITION IN
EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES

Abstract

The  United  States  is  locked  in  a  long-term  strategic  competition
with  China  to  shape  the  rapidly  evolving  global  technological  land-
scape.  Innovation  in  emerging  technologies  could  transform  society,
create  new  industries,  foster  new  dependencies,  and  alter  the  char-
acter  of  warfare.  Whichever  country  secures  a  lead  in  key  technol-
ogies—particularly  those  with  first  mover  advantages—will  tip  the
balance of power in its favor and reap economic benefits far into the
21st century. China under General Secretary of the Chinese Commu-
nist Party (CCP) Xi Jinping has recognized the potential advantages
of seizing the innovation “high ground” in this competition and has
aggressively designed, implemented, and funded programs to domi-
nate technologies of the future. In doing so, Beijing hopes its efforts
will  underpin  national  rejuvenation,  making  the  country  powerful,
self-sufficient,  and  impervious  to  perceived  technological  “contain-
ment”  from  the  United  States  and  its  allies  and  partners.  China
has  focused  on  developing  emerging  technologies  such  as  artificial
intelligence  (AI),  quantum  technologies,  biotechnology,  and  battery
energy  storage  systems.  The  United  States  has  similarly  realized
the  importance  of  technology  competition  with  China  and  has  sig-
nificantly  altered  the  policy  environment  around  key  technologies,
particularly semiconductors, advanced computing, and clean energy.
China faces many challenges, including these U.S. policies, a falter-
ing domestic economy, and inefficiencies inherent in its state-direct-
ed innovation system. However, if China manages to overcome these
challenges,  its  rapid  technological  progress  threatens  U.S.  economic
and  military  leadership  and  may  erode  deterrence  and  stability  in
the Pacific, as well as tip the global balance of power.

Key Findings

 • The  CCP  is  prioritizing  research  in  key  emerging  technolo-
gy  areas  such  as AI,  quantum  technology,  biotechnology,  and
batteries with the goal of becoming a world leader in science
and  technology.  Xi  is  placing  a  bet  that  China’s  investments
in  high-tech  industries  will  unleash  “new  quality  productive
forces,”  transcend  an  old  growth  model  reliant  on  infrastruc-
ture and lower-technology exports, and help China to achieve

(169)

170

its  goal  of  becoming  a  superpower  in  the  21st  century.  Chi-
na’s  focus  on  emerging  technologies  is  also  motivated  by  its
desire to attain self-sufficiency in what its leaders describe as
“chokepoint” technologies amid an international environment
they perceive as increasingly hostile and to better prepare for
a  potential  conflict  with  the  United  States  over Taiwan  or  in
other  contingencies.

 • China’s  state-centric  approach  and  heavy  investments  in  do-
mestic  innovation  reflect  similar  techno-nationalist  initiatives
dating back to the Mao Zedong era. Under Xi, these efforts have
intensified  as  the  Party  has  sought  to  impose  tighter  top-down
control  in  the  innovation  ecosystem  to  make  breaking  depen-
dencies on foreign technologies a focal point.

 • The United States and China are neck-and-neck, with one being
ahead or behind depending on the specific critical and emerging
technology.  On  certain  manufacturing-intensive  technologies,
like advanced batteries and electric vehicles (EVs), China’s var-
ious efforts have enabled its companies to obtain a clear advan-
tage.

 • Artificial  intelligence:  China  is  making  rapid  advancements
and  noteworthy  investments  in  its  AI  capabilities.  It  is  devel-
oping  AI  not  only  to  advance  China’s  economic  growth  more
broadly  but  also  for  military  applications,  such  as  autonomous
unmanned  systems,  data  processing,  decision-making,  and  cog-
nitive  warfare.  Across  key  aspects  of  AI  competition,  however,
China is having mixed success.
 ○ Advanced  semiconductors:  The  United  States  and
like-minded countries currently have an advantage in the ad-
vanced semiconductors needed to power AI technologies. Chi-
na is aggressively working to address this deficit.

 ○ Compute  and  cloud:  The  United  States  leads  in  total  com-
pute  and  cloud,  but  several  Chinese  companies  have  notable
cloud capabilities. Further, the nature of cloud computing cre-
ates a heightened threat of “leakage” into China of advanced
compute capabilities located outside of China.

 ○ AI  models:  The  United  States  currently  leads  the  world  in
developing  robust  AI  models,  but  China  is  pursuing  numer-
ous  government-led  and  ostensibly  private  efforts  to  develop
advanced AI models.

 ○ Data:  Data  are  critical  to  AI  capabilities.  Each  country  has
certain advantages in terms of collection, use, and availability
of  data  for AI  systems.  China  understands  the  value  of  data
to AI and has taken active measures to increase the availabil-
ity of quality data within its AI ecosystem.

 • Quantum technologies: Both the United States and China are
heavily  funding  research  in  quantum  computing,  sensing,  and
communications,  the  three  subdomains  that  together  make  up
quantum information science (QIS). While QIS is still in an ear-
ly stage of development, it will have significant competitive and
military impacts if it becomes commercially viable. China’s Par-

171

ty-state  drives  quantum  research  through  support  to  a  major
state  laboratory  in Anhui  Province  as  well  as  a  growing  roster
of state-backed startup companies. China appears to be an early
leader  in  quantum  communications,  launching  the  world’s  first
quantum  communications  satellite  and  connecting  two  ground
stations  with  quantum  key  distribution.  In  other  areas,  Chi-
na  appears  to  be  lagging  behind  the  United  States,  though  its
scientists  have  claimed  breakthroughs  in  cracking  encrypted
communications  systems  and  developing  advanced  radar  tech-
nology, claims that are difficult to confirm.

 • Biotechnology: Biotechnology is another key emerging technol-
ogy  with  the  potential  for  transforming  many  industries.  Chi-
na  aims  to  use  biotechnologies  to  make  itself  less  dependent
on U.S. agriculture while embedding Chinese firms in U.S. food
production  and  supply  chains  in  genomic,  pharmaceutical,  and
other biotechnologies. The major research and market presence
of Chinese genomic and biotech services companies in the Unit-
ed States gives these companies access to key technologies and
data.

 • Advanced  batteries:  China  has  attained  a  sizable  advantage
at  each  stage  of  the  battery  supply  chain,  ushering  in  rapid
global market share increases for Chinese EV and battery mak-
ers.  China’s  near  monopoly  on  battery  manufacturing  creates
dependencies  for  U.S.  auto  manufacturers  reliant  on  upstream
suppliers  as  well  as  potential  latent  threats  to  U.S.  critical  in-
frastructure from the ongoing installation of Chinese-made bat-
tery energy storage systems throughout U.S. electrical grids and
backup systems for industrial users.

Recommendations
The Commission recommends:

 • Congress establish and fund a Manhattan Project-like program
dedicated  to  racing  to  and  acquiring  an  Artificial  General  In-
telligence  (AGI)  capability. AGI  is  generally  defined  as  systems
that  are  as  good  as  or  better  than  human  capabilities  across
all  cognitive  domains  and  would  surpass  the  sharpest  human
minds at every task. Among the specific actions the Commission
recommends for Congress:
 ○ Provide  broad  multiyear  contracting  authority  to  the  execu-
tive  branch  and  associated  funding  for  leading  artificial  in-
telligence,  cloud,  and  data  center  companies  and  others  to
advance the stated policy at a pace and scale consistent with
the goal of U.S. AGI leadership; and

 ○ Direct the U.S. secretary of defense to provide a Defense Pri-
orities  and  Allocations  System  “DX  Rating”  to  items  in  the
artificial intelligence ecosystem to ensure this project receives
national priority.

 • Congress consider legislation to:

 ○ Require  prior  approval  and  ongoing  oversight  of  Chinese  in-
volvement  in  biotechnology  companies  engaged  in  operations

172

in  the  United  States,  including  research  or  other  related
transactions.  Such  approval  and  oversight  operations  shall
be  conducted  by  the  U.S.  Department  of  Health  and  Human
Services in consultation with other appropriate governmental
entities. In identifying the involvement of Chinese entities or
interests in the U.S. biotechnology sector, Congress should in-
clude firms and persons:
  Engaged in genomic research;
  Evaluating  and/or  reporting  on  genetic  data,  including  for
medical  or  therapeutic  purposes  or  ancestral  documenta-
tion;

  Participating in pharmaceutical development;
  Involved with U.S. colleges and universities; and
  Involved  with  federal,  state,  or  local  governments  or  agen-

cies and departments.

 ○ Support  significant  Federal  Government  investments  in  bio-
technology  in  the  United  States  and  with  U.S.  entities  at
every  level  of  the  technology  development  cycle  and  supply
chain,  from  basic  research  through  product  development  and
market  deployment,  including  investments  in  intermediate
services capacity and equipment manufacturing capacity.
 • To  protect  U.S.  economic  and  national  security  interests,  Con-
gress  consider  legislation  to  restrict  or  ban  the  importation  of
certain technologies and services controlled by Chinese entities,
including:
 ○ Autonomous  humanoid  robots  with  advanced  capabilities  of

(i) dexterity, (ii) locomotion, and (iii) intelligence; and

 ○ Energy  infrastructure  products  that  involve  remote  servic-
ing,  maintenance,  or  monitoring  capabilities,  such  as  load
balancing  and  other  batteries  supporting  the  electrical
grid,  batteries  used  as  backup  systems  for  industrial  facil-
ities  and/or  critical  infrastructure,  and  transformers  and
associated  equipment.

 • Congress  encourage  the  Administration’s  ongoing  rulemaking
efforts  regarding  “connected  vehicles”  to  cover  industrial  ma-
chinery,  Internet  of  Things  devices,  appliances,  and  other  con-
nected  devices  produced  by  Chinese  entities  or  including  Chi-
nese technologies that can be accessed, serviced, maintained, or
updated remotely or through physical updates.

 • Congress enact legislation prohibiting granting seats on boards
of  directors  and  information  rights  to  China-based  investors  in
strategic  technology  sectors.  Allowing  foreign  investors  to  hold
seats and observer seats on the boards of U.S. technology start-
ups  provides  them  with  sensitive  strategic  information,  which
could  be  leveraged  to  gain  competitive  advantages.  Prohibiting
this practice would protect intellectual property and ensure that
U.S. technological advances are not compromised. It would also
reduce  the  risk  of  corporate  espionage,  safeguarding  America’s
leadership in emerging technologies.

 • Congress establish that:

173

 ○ The  U.S.  government  will  unilaterally  or  with  key  interna-
tional  partners  seek  to  vertically  integrate  in  the  develop-
ment and commercialization of quantum technology.

 ○ Federal Government investments in quantum technology sup-
port every level of the technology development cycle and sup-
ply  chain  from  basic  research  through  product  development
and market deployment,  including  investments in intermedi-
ate services capacity.

 ○ The  Office  of  Science  and  Technology  Policy,  in  consultation
with  appropriate  agencies  and  experts,  develop  a  Quantum
Technology Supply Chain Roadmap to ensure that the United
States  coordinates  outbound  investment,  U.S.  critical  supply
chain assessments, the activities of the Committee on Foreign
Investment in the United States (CFIUS), and federally sup-
ported  research  activities  to  ensure  that  the  United  States,
along  with  key  allies  and  partners,  will  lead  in  this  critical
technology  and  not  advance  Chinese  capabilities  and  devel-
opment.

Introduction

This  chapter  examines  U.S.-China  technology  competition  from
the  standpoint  of  economic  and  national  security.  Beijing  hopes  its
efforts  to  gain  leadership  in  emerging  technology  will  underpin  na-
tional  rejuvenation,  making  the  country  powerful,  self-sufficient,
and  impervious  to  perceived  technological  “containment”  from  the
United  States  and  its  allies  and  partners.1  This  chapter  first  pro-
vides  context,  noting  a  recent  shift  in  U.S.  policy  across  multiple
administrations to address the challenges of technology competition
with  China  and  China’s  efforts  to  lead  in  key  technologies.  It  then
focuses  on  U.S.-China  technology  competition  in  four  key  emerging
technology areas: AI, QIS, biotechnology, and advanced battery tech-
nology.  For  each  technology,  the  chapter  highlights  commercial  and
national  security  implications  of  the  technology,  compares  relative
capabilities of China and the United States, examines China’s poli-
cies and investments, and analyzes China’s exploration of such tech-
nologies  for  military  and  national  security  uses.  Lastly,  the  chapter
discusses  the  implications  of  U.S.-China  technology  competition  for
the national security and economic prosperity of the United States.
The  chapter  draws  on  the  Commission’s  February  2024  hearing  on
“Current  and  Emerging  Technologies  in  U.S.-China  Economic  and
National  Security  Competition,”  consultations  with  experts,  and
open source research and analysis.

Securing U.S. Advantage in Emerging Technologies
The  policy  environment  around  U.S.-China  technology  compe-
tition  has  shifted  significantly.  For  years,  Chinese  companies  and
the  Party-state  have  sought  to  acquire  U.S.  cutting-edge  technolo-
gy, intellectual property (IP), and know-how through licit and illicit
means. For much of that time, outside of narrow export controls and
occasional  foreign  investment  reviews,  U.S.  policy  was  inadequate-
ly  responsive  to  China’s  technology  policies  and  ambitions.  A  large

174

constraint on technology transfer to China in many areas came from
the reluctance of U.S. companies to transfer their best technology to
China out of concerns over IP theft rather than U.S. law.2 In recent
years, however, successive administrations and Congress have iden-
tified  emerging  technologies  as  central  to  the  U.S.-China  strategic
competition.

As attitudes in the United States have shifted, the United States
has  taken  a  number  of  steps  in  recent  years  to  better  protect  U.S.
national security and shore up U.S. advantages in the development,
production,  and  protection  of  these  technologies.  U.S.  policymakers
have identified certain “critical and emerging technologies” or “foun-
dational”  technologies  as  vital  to  economic  and  national  security,
including  advanced  semiconductors,  quantum  information  systems,
and  AI;  biotechnologies  and  biomanufacturing;  and  clean  energy
generation  and  storage  technology.3  Each  of  these  families  of  tech-
nologies  carries  the  potential  to  be  a  “force  multiplier”  across  the
various fields of technology, accelerating the broader pace of innova-
tion  and  adoption,  and  serving  as  a  bedrock  upon  which  to  ground
future  industries.4  Each  also  has  significant  national  security  im-
plications.

U.S. policy has begun to shift to recognize the importance of com-
petition with China over these critical technologies. In recent years,
the  United  States  has  made  investments  to  help  ensure  it  retains
an  edge  in  key  foundational  technologies;  it  has  also  expanded  use
of  export  controls  relating  to  advanced  semiconductors  and AI  and
tightened  up  other  avenues  that  adversaries  use  to  gain  access  to
sensitive U.S. technology. Now that U.S. policymakers have realized
the  stakes,  U.S.-China  technology  competition  will  continue  to  be  a
key  issue  in  the  U.S.-China  economic  and  security  policy  space  for
years to come.

China  Has  Long  Sought  Dominance  in  Emerging

Technologies

China  has  long  sought  to  spur  domestic  science  and  technology
innovation  to  enhance  its  military  and  commercial  progress,  but  it
is  intensifying  its  efforts  in  light  of  disruptive  global  events  and
heightened  competition  with  the  United  States.  China  is  seeking
to  dominate  emerging  technology  industries  to  sustain  economic
growth  as  traditional  sectors  atrophy  and  to  exert  greater  global
influence via the trade and economic leverage that come with these
technologies.

The CCP has clearly articulated and publicly stated its priorities
in  emerging  technologies,  and  it  leverages  a  variety  of  assets  to  di-
rect  attention,  effort,  and  resources  toward  these  priorities.  In  con-
trast to the more market-oriented innovation landscape in the Unit-
ed States, the state takes on a much more prominent role in China’s
technology  ecosystem,  with  the  government  strategically  allocating
funding  and  resources  to  industries  and  research  areas  deemed  a
priority.5 The results of abundant and sustained state support have
been  mixed,  creating  expected  inefficiencies  commonly  associated
with centrally planned economies and yet also enabling tremendous
returns  to  scale  for  fledgling  industries  that  have  resulted  in  clear
comparative  advantages  for  Chinese  producers  of  certain  technolo-

175

gies.6 Despite the traction of some of these efforts, China faces chal-
lenges, including a shortage of highly skilled workers and economic
headwinds.7  Additionally,  while  China  has  increased  its  scientific
research and patent output, translating these findings into ground-
breaking innovations and economic benefits remains a hurdle.8

China under the CCP has a long history of techno-nationalism, of-
ten rooted in fear of being dominated by technologically superior for-
eign powers.9 For example, China successfully developed the atomic
bomb in 1964 through “Project 596,” a national initiative that aimed
to  build  nuclear  weapons.10  Similar  national  innovation  programs
have  been  used  to  achieve  advancement  in  targeted  technology  ar-
eas,  such  as  the  National  High-Tech  R&D  Program  (863  Program)
established in 1986 and the National Basic Research Program (973
Program)  established  in  1997.11  These  large  government-funded
initiatives  channeled  financing  and  resources  to  scientists  and  en-
trepreneurs credited with producing the world’s first quantum tele-
phone  network,  improved  solar  technology,  and  the  Tianhe-1A  su-
percomputer, which for a time was the world’s fastest computer.12

In the mid-2000s, China made explicit its intention to use technol-
ogy policy to move up the value chain of global production, increase
its  indigenous  capacity,  and  become  a  global  leader  in  certain  tech-
nology  areas. The  2006  Medium-  to  Long-Term  Program  (MLP)  for
the Development of  Science and Technology articulated the  need to
facilitate indigenous innovation and set specific goals to be achieved
by 2020. These included targets in research and development (R&D)
spending,  patent  filing,  and  publication  of  academic  articles.13  Chi-
na  implemented  numerous  policies  under  the  MLP  in  the  ensuing
years,  many  of  which  ran  counter  to  the  letter  and  spirit  of  WTO
rules.14

Techno-Nationalism Accelerates under Xi

General  Secretary  Xi  has  continued—and  in  recent  years,  accel-
erated—these  techno-nationalist  policies,  focusing  efforts  on  tech-
nologies  he  believes  are  transformative  and  can  propel  China  into
dominance  this  century  by  leapfrogging  the  United  States.  Seek-
ing  to  accelerate  progress  under  the  MLP,  in  2015,  China  rolled
out  “Made  in  China  (MIC)  2025,”  a  more  comprehensive  industri-
al  policy  intended  to  improve  manufacturing  processes  and  achieve
breakthroughs  in  ten  high-value  sectors.* 15  MIC  set  ambitious  do-
mestic  market  share  targets  in  the  identified  priority  sectors  for
Chinese-made products, including 80 percent for EVs and batteries,
70  percent  for  industrial  robotics,  and  40  percent  for  mobile  phone

86 percent of these targets had been met or exceeded.17

Xi  has  doubled  down  on  the  state-centric  approach  in  order  to
seize  the  “high  ground”  of  innovation,  rhetorically  highlighting  its
importance  and  promulgating  further  iterations  to  industrial  poli-
cy.18  In  speeches  and  policy  documents,  Xi  and  other  top  Chinese

leaders  have  emphasized  the  need  to  reduce  reliance  on  so-called
“chokepoint”  technologies,  particularly  those  controlled  by  Western
countries,  by  achieving  breakthroughs  in  domestic  innovation  and
developing  alternative  sources  of  supply.* 19  In  March  2023,  the
State  Council  asserted  that  global  competition  and  external  “con-
tainment”  necessitated  the  acceleration  of “high-level  scientific  and
technological self-reliance and self-improvement.” 20

China’s  14th  Five-Year  Plan  (2021–2025)  built  on  previous  ini-
tiatives  to  advance  high-priority  sectors  like  AI,  QIS,  biotechnolo-
gy,  and  advanced  batteries.21  It  also  indicated  a  response  to  what
the  CCP  perceives  as  an  increasingly  hostile  and  disruptive  global
environment  by  incorporating  the  “dual-circulation” †  development
model  and  placing  an  emphasis  on  obtaining  foreign  technologies
through pathways that remain open, such as research partnerships,
establishing R&D centers abroad, and providing incentives for tech-
nological talent to work in China.22

More recently, Xi has introduced the concept of “new quality pro-
ductive  forces,”  which  the  National  People’s  Congress  elevated  as
its top policy priority during its annual meeting in March 2024 and
adopted  at  the  Third  Plenum  held  a  few  months  later  in  July.23
This  slogan,  now  being  widely  disseminated  in  Chinese  political
discourse, indicates that China is focusing its state-led economic ef-
forts  to  enhance  competitiveness  in  emerging  technologies  like  AI
and  clean  energy  to  ensure  continued  economic  growth  and  global
economic leverage through dominance in key technologies of the fu-
ture.24 In doing so, China hopes to eclipse the United States across
the full spectrum of national power.25

Under  Xi,  the  CCP  regime  has  also  moved  to  assert  greater  con-
trol  over  science  and  technology  innovation  efforts,  aiming  to  en-
hance  Party  control  and  ensure  alignment  with  Party  priorities.26
After  the  reform  and  opening  up  era  in  the  1980s,  China  facilitat-
ed  research  and  capital  linkages  through  a  system  of  hundreds  of
publicly funded laboratories—often integrated into universities and
private  companies—and  by  clustering  research  facilities  and  busi-
nesses  in  development  zones.27  This  decentralized  approach  was
intended  to  harness  private  efforts  and  allow  for  localized  policy
experimentation.28  In  2016,  the  Party  under  Xi  moved  to  reform
the system of state labs and development zones under the “Innova-

* While  publicly  available  official  policy  documents  describe  “key  and  core  technologies”  con-
trolled by “others” as an area of concern, Chinese leadership rarely delineates these technologies.
In  a  2021  speech  before  the  Chinese Academy  of  Sciences,  Xi  called  on  the  scientific  community
to “resolutely win the battle over key core technologies” by focusing efforts on basic research that
can  “break  through  bottlenecks”  and  “understand  the  basic  theories  and  technical  principles  of
‘chokepoint’  technologies.”  In  2018,  the  Chinese  state  media  newspaper  Science  and  Technology
Daily  published  a  list  of  35  chokepoint  technologies  reviewed  and  approved  by  the  Ministry  of
Science  and  Technology,  among  them  machinery  to  fabricate  semiconductors  such  as  photo-li-
thography machines and vacuum evaporators, specialized steel alloys, and aviation software. Ben

tion-Driven  Development  Strategy.” 29  A  key  objective  of  this  strat-
egy  is  to  consolidate  what  was  determined  to  be  a  fragmented  in-
novation  landscape  with  an  overabundance  of  research  funding  for
underperforming  efforts  into  higher-performing  equivalent  institu-
tions more directly controlled by the CCP and focused on achieving
self-sufficiency  in  key  “bottleneck”  technologies.30  In  March  2023,
China  also  announced  plans  to  restructure  its  Ministry  of  Science
and  Technology  to  reduce  its  responsibilities  and  centralize  Party
control through  the establishment of a  decision-making  body called
the Central Commission on Science and Technology.31

Funding  Mechanisms  Buttress  China’s  Science  and

Technology Ambitions

The  United  States  has  long  led  the  world  in  both  public  and  pri-
vate sector funding for R&D,* though China is closing the gap. The
Chinese  government  has  prioritized  R&D  funding  to  accelerate  its
ambitions to innovate in science and technology and better compete
with  the  United  States.32 According  to  data  from  the  Organisation
for  Economic  Co-operation  and  Development  (OECD)  that  compare
R&D  spending  across  countries  using  purchasing  power  parity,  in
2021  the  United  States  continues  to  outpace  China  on  total  R&D,
spending $806 billion (3.46 percent of gross domestic product [GDP])
compared  to  China’s  $667.6  billion  (2.43  percent  of  GDP).33  In  this
dataset,  government  funding  represented  roughly  20  percent  of  to-
tal  R&D  spending  in  both  countries.34  However,  a  2023  estimate
from Rhodium Group found that approximately 60 percent of all fi-
nancing within China’s science and technology ecosystem came from
government-related  sources  of  funding  after  accounting  for  tax  in-
centives and off-budget financing, distinguishing it from other large
and  technologically  advanced  economies.35  In  total  dollars  spent,
U.S.  multinational  enterprises  in  high-tech  industries  spent  240
percent  more  on  R&D  than  Chinese  firms  in  2021,  spending  $529
billion  and  $154  billion,  respectively.36  However,  when  adjusted  for
wage  differences,  U.S.  companies  only  spent  80  percent  more  than
their  Chinese  counterparts.37  In  her  written  testimony  before  the
Commission,  Ngor  Luong,  a  senior  research  analyst  at  the  Center
for  Security  and  Emerging  Technology  (CSET),  noted  that  in  2022
the  Chinese  National  Bureau  of  Statistics  reported  that  the  coun-
try’s R&D investment increased by 10 percent from 2021, outpacing
its goal of 7 percent annual increases outlined in the 14th Five-Year
Plan.38

In  addition  to  direct  government  funding,  traditionally,  China
has  utilized  an  array  of  state-owned  enterprises  (SOEs)  to  direct

* R&D is typically subdivided into three components: (1) basic research, which is experimental
or  theoretical  and  attempts  to  generate  new  knowledge  devoid  of  a  particular  application;  (2)
applied research, which seeks to acquire new knowledge that can be directed toward a practical
objective;  and  (3)  experimental  development,  which  is  the  systematic  approach  to  utilize  knowl-
edge  gained  through  research  to  produce  new  products  or  services  or  improve  existing  products
or  services.  Together,  basic  research  and  applied  research  comprise  “fundamental  research.”  In
medical  and  life  sciences,  the  more  common  term “translational  research,”  sometimes  used  syn-
onymously  with  applied  research,  is  the  process  of  moving  discoveries  from  basic  research  into
medical  applications  for  patients  and  populations.  National  Institutes  of  Health,  “About  Trans-
lational Science,” April 19, 2024; Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, “Re-

capital  to  key  sectors  and  advance  national  innovation  goals.  Chi-
na’s  Minister  of  Science  and  Technology  Wang  Zhigang  has  called
on  SOEs  to  be  “pillars”  in  the  country’s  whole-of-nation  approach
to achieve self-sufficiency and high-technology innovation.39 China’s
state-owned  banks  have  been  instrumental  in  directing  capital  to
national priorities, exemplified by six state-owned investors together
providing one-third of the investment in the latest $47 billion semi-
conductor fund alongside other SOEs and the Ministry of Finance.40
China’s central government is expected to continue to provide robust
support  to  SOEs  involved  in  national  security  priorities,  including
aerospace  and  defense  and  policy  banks,  while  support  for  those  in
disfavored  sectors,  such  as  real  estate  and  even  consumer  goods,  is
less assured.41 Beyond providing funding, SOEs have been directed
to increase their own levels of R&D spending and seek opportunities
to integrate more agile high-tech small and medium enterprises into
their supply chains.42

Beijing  also  uses  government  guidance  funds—public-private
funding  mechanisms  that  blend  state  capital  with  Chinese  private
equity and venture capital—to steer capital toward strategic indus-
tries  such  as AI.43  However,  Ms.  Luong,  along  with  research  fellow
Zachary  Arnold  and  Chinese  translation  manager  Ben  Murphy  at
CSET,  find  that  in  practice  “most  guidance  funds  fail  to  live  up  to
their  ambitions,  weakened  by  unrealistic  goals,  bureaucratic  con-
straints, incompetent management, risk aversion, and a lack of mar-
ket discipline.” 44

The Reshaping of Beijing’s Innovation Drive to Utilize Small

and Medium-Sized Enterprises

Over  the  past  decade,  China  has  pivoted  its  innovation-oriented
policies  to  refocus  on  supporting  small  and  medium-sized  (SMEs),
developing a whole-of-nation approach to fostering small but highly
innovative  firms. As  emphasized  in  2023  by  Premier  Li  Qiang,  Bei-
jing  now  believes  that  “supporting  early  tech  startups  should  be  a
top  priority.” 45  This  shift  reflects  both  Beijing’s  acknowledgement
of the success of “hidden” champions * in China’s startup ecosystem
and  its  desire  to  curtail  the “disorderly  expansion  of  capital,”  seek-
ing  to  avoid  what  the  Party-state  viewed  as  an  excessive  concen-
tration  of  investment  in  e-platforms,  including  services  like  video
gaming and online tutoring.46

The  Little  Giants  program,  officially  launched  in  2018,  forms
the  core  of  Beijing’s  efforts  to  develop  a  multi-tiered  system  to
help SMEs compete in emerging technologies or occupy niche but
critical segments of global supply chains.47 The Ministry of Indus-
try and Information Technology (MIIT) certified the first batch of
companies  as  “Little  Giants”  in  2019,  and  tens  of  thousands  of
SMEs have since received support from the initiative.48 This sys-
tem encompasses a broad array of tools to foster innovation, from
direct  subsidies  to  initiatives  enhancing  SME-university  collabo-
ration.49  However,  the  most  important  element  is  the  broadened

* Technology  analyst  Dan  Wang  argues  that  many  outside  observers  underestimate  China’s
innovation  capacity  in  part  due  to  China’s  innovative  firms  being  concentrated  in  “less  flashy”
manufacturing  capabilities  and  products  sold  at  lower  price  points  in  lower-income  countries.

access  to  capital  markets  for  Little  Giants.50  SMEs  have  histori-
cally  struggled  to  access  financing  within  China’s  bank-dominat-
ed  financial  system  where  lenders  prioritize  credit  to  SOEs  and
large  non-state  firms.51  This  acts  as  a  barrier  to  innovation  for
many  non-state  enterprises,  one  that  Beijing  aims  to  ameliorate
through  the  Little  Giants  program.52

China  has  created  a  series  of  new  financing  mechanisms  over
the  past  several  years  for  small  firms  operating  in  priority  in-
dustries,  with  varying  degrees  of  success.  In  2019,  the  Shang-
hai-based  Science  and  Technology  Innovation  Board,  or  STAR
Market,  was  launched  to  expand  equity  investment  in  smaller
Chinese  technology  companies.53  The  exchange  hosts  over  500
companies  with  a  combined  market  cap  of  $716.7  billion  as  of
June  2024,  and  it  predominately  fast-tracks  initial  public  of-
ferings  (IPOs)  for  companies  in  high-tech  fields,  including  new
materials,  biomedicine,  and  information  technology.54  The  STAR
Market  initially  outperformed  China’s  other  major  indices,  but
as  of  August  2024  it  has  fallen  59.7  percent  since  its  peak  in
July  2020.55  Following  lackluster  performance  of  the  index  in
recent  years,  the  China  Securities  Regulatory  Commission  has
since raised the requirements for companies seeking to list.56 The
Beijing  Stock  Exchange  also  opened  in  2021  for  even  smaller  en-
terprises  (with  a  minimum  market  value  of  $30  million,  relative
to the $140 million required to list on the STAR Market).57 Little
Giants accounted for around 40 percent of listings across all stock
exchanges  in  China  in  2022.58

Additionally,  China  is  guiding  its  banking  sector  to  provide  easy
access  to  credit,  with  the  People’s  Bank  of  China  (PBOC)  creating
a  special  purpose  lending  facility  that  enables  innovative  SMEs  in
science  and  technology  areas  to  refinance  loans  well  below  market
rates.59 At  the  end  of  2023,  total  lending  to  sci-tech  SMEs  reached
$340  billion  (renminbi  [RMB]  2.45  trillion),*  an  increase  of  21.9
percent  relative  to  2022  and  outpacing  overall  loan  growth  by  11.8
percentage  points.60  Leaderdrive,  a  non-state  SME  that  produces
components  for  industrial  robots,  is  an  illustrative  example  of  the
financial  support  firms  gain  access  to  under  the  program.61  After
it  was  awarded  the  Little  Giant  title  in  2019,  Leaderdrive  benefit-
ed  from  both  government  guidance  fund  investments  and  a  listing
on  the  STAR  Market  in  2020.62  Large  domestic  industrial  robotics
manufacturers also provide a source of ongoing demand for Leader-
drive’s production.63

Case Studies in U.S.-China Technology Competition
Both the United States and China view AI, QIS, biotechnology, and
advanced  battery  technology  as  some  of  the  key  strategic  emerging
industries  of  the  future.64  As  outlined  in  the  14th  Five  Year  Plan
(2021–2025), China views these technologies as integral to strength-
ening its national defense in tandem with driving innovation.65 The
following  sections  will  assess  U.S.-China  technology  competition  in
these four technologies.

Artificial  Intelligence:  A  Revolutionary  Technology  with

Significant Military Implications

In the broader geostrategic competition between the United States
and China, leadership in Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential
to reshape the global balance of power.66 AI is the science and engi-
neering of machines that use complex “algorithms, modeled after the
decision-making processes of the human brain, that can ‘learn’ from
available  data  and  make  increasingly  more  accurate  classifications
and predictions over time.” * 67 In recent years, AI has been used to
solve  complex  problems,  provide  predictive  analytics,  recognize  and
interpret visual information, engage in natural language processing
to create high-quality content and “understand” and analyze written
and  verbal  language,  and  speed  the  development  of  robotics.68 The
country  that  leads  in  AI  has  the  potential  to  reap  economic  bene-
fits  including  productivity  enhancement  and  the  ability  to  innovate
new  products  and  services  and  enable  insights  for  business  leaders
through data analysis.69 The full extent to which AI will transform
and underpin various industries is still unfolding, but its estimated
impact  is  massive.  McKinsey  &  Company  estimates  that  AI  could
add  up  to  $4.4  trillion  annually  to  the  global  economy.70  As  dis-
cussed  below, AI  also  has  numerous  military  applications  that  may
provide  a  strategic  advantage  to  the  United  States  or  China  in  an
Indo-Pacific conflict.71

The United States and China Vie for AI Supremacy

China  recognizes  the  transformational  potential  of  AI  and  is
positioning  itself  to  capitalize  on  technological  breakthroughs.
Chinese  commentators  point  to  the  defeat  of  the  top  Chinese
player in the boardgame Go by Google’s AlphaGo in May 2017 as
a “Sputnik moment” for the country, which kicked off an effort to
channel  attention  and  resources  from  entrepreneurs,  tech  talent,
and  policymakers.72  Two  months  later,  the  State  Council  issued
an  AI  strategy  titled  the  “New  Generation  Artificial  Intelligence
Development  Plan,”  which  called  for  increased  funding  and  sup-
port  to  make  China  a  leader  in  AI  theory,  technology,  applica-
tion,  and  innovation  by  2030.73  Then,  in  late  2022,  the  powerful
demonstration  of  OpenAI’s  generative  model  ChatGPT-3  again
surprised  China’s  AI  industry,  exemplifying  a  clear  advantage
for  the  United  States.74  At  the  annual  meeting  of  China’s  rub-
ber-stamp  legislature,  Premier  Li  announced  an  “AI+”  initiative
in  his  work  report  intended  to  “actively  develop  the  digital  in-
dustry, transform traditional industries with digital technologies,
and  fully  integrate  digital  technology  into  the  real  economy.” 75
Beijing  is  making  noteworthy  investments  in  its  AI  capabilities,
utilizing  government  funding  mechanisms  and  leveraging  the
non-state sector for its economic development and efforts to “leap-
frog”  the  United  States  militarily.76

* There  are  numerous  subtypes  of AI  that  serve  various  uses.  One  of  the  major  types  of AI  is
machine  learning,  in  which  a  computer  algorithm  is  developed  to  analyze  and  make  predictions
from  data  that  are  provided  in  a  system.  Deep  learning,  a  form  of  machine  learning,  uses  com-
plex  layers  of  computation  to  form  a  deep  neural  network,  which  is  capable  of  learning  from
large amounts of unstructured data. IBM, “Understanding the Different Types of Artificial Intelli-
gence,” October 12, 2023; National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering, Artificial
Intelligence (AI).

The  race  for  superior  AI  across  industries  relies  on  successfully
bringing together enabling technologies and building blocks, includ-
ing  advanced  chips;  computational  power,  including  cloud  services;
well-designed  algorithmic  models;  and  vast  and  rich  data  to  train
models.  Currently,  the  United  States  has  a  lead  in  most  of  these
technologies and building blocks.

Semiconductors Underpin U.S.-China AI Competition

Semiconductors  are  integral  to  U.S.-China  competition  in AI. Ad-
vanced  semiconductors  are  key  to  AI  capabilities  due  to  their  role
in  accelerating  processing  speeds  and  harnessing  the  computation-
al  power  needed  for  complicated AI-related  computing  tasks.77 The
United  States  currently  has  a  lead  in  advanced  semiconductors.78
According  to  an  August  2024  report  by  the  Information  Technol-
ogy  and  Innovation  Foundation,  Chinese  competitors  are  around
“five  years  behind  global  leaders  in  high-volume  manufacturing  of
leading-edge  logic  semiconductor  chips”  and  trail  in  memory  chips
and semiconductor manufacturing equipment.79 U.S. companies like
NVIDIA and AMD dominate the design of advanced chips, and they
are  fabricated  almost  exclusively  by  Taiwan  Semiconductor  Manu-
facturing Company (TSMC).80 The United States has sought to pro-
tect  that  lead  through  export  controls  and  domestic  investments.81
The  U.S.  government  and  its  partners  and  allies  have  introduced
targeted export controls that have undercut China’s ability to access
high-end  chips  and  to  fabricate  them  domestically.82  At  the  same
time, the United States has made substantial investments in grow-
ing  domestic  production  capacity  through  the  CHIPS  and  Science
Act.83

China  has  been  investing  heavily  in  its  domestic  semiconductor
industry  to  boost  its  AI  capabilities  and  overcome  its  dependence
on global supply chains, but it still faces numerous hurdles to over-
taking  the  United  States. The  export  controls  by  the  United  States
and  its  allies  against  China,  coupled  with  China’s  desire  to  boost
its  AI  capacities,  have  spurred  China’s  domestic  chip  industry  to
develop more rapidly, leading to significant additional spending and
experimentation.84  In  March  2024,  the  Economist  Intelligence  Unit
estimated  that  since  2014,  China’s  state-led  investment  into  its
semiconductor industry exceeded $150 billion, including central and
provincial  government  support.85  That  estimate  came  prior  to  the
May  2024  announcement  that  the  third  phase  of  the  Chinese  gov-
ernment-supported  Integrated  Circuit  Industry  Investment  Fund
(often called “the Big Fund”) had raised $47.5 billion of investment
to support China’s semiconductor industry.86 If this is all new mon-
ey, it would bring the total since 2014 to $197.5 billion. At the local
level,  there  are  numerous  provinces  and  municipalities  that  have
issued  subsidies  for  local  semiconductor-related  firms  or  to  support
the buildout of the local semiconductor industry.* 87 Specific to AI-fo-
cused  chips,  Beijing’s  municipal  government  has  also  provided  new
subsidies  for  firms  that  purchase  domestically  produced AI  chips.88
In April 2024, the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Economy and Infor-

* Other instances where subsidies at the local level have been provided include Beijing, Shang-
hai, Suzhou, Nanjing, Shenzhen, Qingdao, Hefei, Tianjin, Changsha, Wuhan, Chengdu, Wuxi, Hu-
nan Province, Jiangsu Province, and Guangdong Province. See endnote 87 for sourcing.

mation  Technology  announced  that  it  would  give  companies  a  per-
centage of their investment for purchases of domestically controlled
graphic  processing  unit  (GPU)  chips  used  in  intelligent  computing
services,  with  the  city  seeking  to  become  fully  self-reliant  in  smart
computing infrastructure hardware and software by 2027 under the
initiative.89

China  has  made  some  strides  in  closing  the  gap  on  cutting-edge
GPU  semiconductors  used  to  train  AI  models.  Wang  Tao,  Huawei’s
chief operating officer of its Ascend and Kunpeng ecosystem, claims
that  Huawei’s  Ascend  910B  AI  chip  is  capable  of  up  to  80  percent
of the performance of NVIDIA’s A100 GPU when training large lan-
guage models (LLMs), and in “some other tests” surpasses the A100
by 20 percent.90 Analysts and sources quoted by Reuters claim that
the 910B chips are comparable to NVIDIA’s in terms of raw comput-
ing power but lag in performance.* 91 According to a detailed analy-
sis  by  CSET, “the  performance  increase  is  smaller  than  advertised;
only  75  percent  of  the  theoretical  maximum  performance  increase
can  be  attributed  to  an  actual  increase  in  hardware  performance”
and  “Huawei  reduced  the  number  of  active  AI  cores  between  the
910 and 910B series—likely either due to poor yields or limited ca-
pacity  on  SMIC’s  7nm  fabrication  process.” 92  In  August  2024,  the
Wall  Street  Journal  reported  that  Huawei  is  close  to  introducing  a
new chip for AI use, the Ascend 910C, which the company claims is
comparable  to  NVIDIA’s  H100.93  However,  it  has  faced  production
delays  with  these  chips,  and  further  U.S.  restrictions  may  prevent
access  to  machine  components  and  memory  chips  for  its  AI  hard-
ware.94 Additionally, some experts have argued that the underlying
technology  being  used  to  produce  Huawei’s  chips  has  significantly
lower  “yield,”  meaning  that  a  significant  portion  of  the  chips  pro-
duced are flawed and do not function effectively, resulting in appre-
ciably higher total costs to manufacture at scale.95

It’s Not Just Chips: How Huawei Seeks to Compete
across the AI “Stack”
To date, U.S. concerns around AI and China have focused large-
ly  on  access  to  advanced  semiconductors.  Similar  to  many  other
advanced technologies, however, AI is powered by a “stack” of en-
abling  hardware,  software,  and  services.  Policymakers  have  paid
much less attention to other elements of the AI stack.

NVIDIA  is  a  leader  in  the AI  space  not  only  because  of  GPUs
but  also  its  CUDA  software.†  Known  as  its  “secret  sauce”  or
“moat,” CUDA is NVIDIA’s closed-source “AI software ecosystem”
that allows programmers to utilize the parallel computing power

* According to a report by AI Now Institute, a New York-based policy institute, computational pow-
er, also known as compute, is measured in floating point operations, or FLOP, which is a mathemat-
ical  operation  that  enables  the  representation  of  extremely  large  numbers  with  greater  precision.
Compute  performance,  on  the  other  hand,  is  measured  in  floating  point  operations  per  second,  or
FLOP/s. This is essentially the number of computations a given resource can carry out in a second. Jai

It’s Not Just Chips: How Huawei Seeks to Compete
across the AI “Stack”—Continued
of  NVIDIA’s  GPUs  for  building  AI  applications.* 96  As  NVIDIA
has been developing CUDA since 2004, it has a lead over both do-
mestic and foreign AI chip design firms in the resources it can of-
fer AI  programmers.† 97 The  symbiosis  within  NVIDIA’s AI  stack
has  led  to  a  “flywheel  effect”  that  makes  the  company  essential
for  many  AI  developers.  As  companies  purchase  more  NVIDIA
GPUs  for  AI  development,  more  developers  use  CUDA;  as  more
developers  use  CUDA,  they  increase  their  dependency  on  NVID-
IA’s GPUs.98

Figure 1: A Comparison of NVIDIA and Huawei’s AI Tech Stacks

Note:  The  diagram  indicates  the  various  software  technologies  (mid-to-upper  layers)  that
are either directly controlled or best optimized for NVIDIA or Huawei’s chip-based hardware
(bottom  layer),  respectively.  CANN  and  CUDA  are  Huawei  and  NVIDIA’s  respective  propri-
etary  software  frameworks  required  to  manage  the  parallel  processing  power  of  their  chips.
MindSpore (Huawei) and PyTorch (PyTorch Foundation) are open source AI frameworks that
rely on or are best optimized for CANN and CUDA, respectively. Finally, Pangu (Huawei) and
ChatGPT (OpenAI) are examples of technologies built or iterated using these AI frameworks.

* CUDA allows for the optimization, speeding up, and programming of NVIDIA GPU’s CUDA core
and machine learning-focused Tensor core sub-processing units necessary for parallel computing and
the  deep  learning  associated  with  building  AI  models.  For  more,  see  1kg,  “cuDNN:  Common  Chal-

† PyTorch and TensorFlow are the most popular AI frameworks for building AI models (though
PyTorch  is  more  widely  used). This  is  evolving  slightly  as  Google  (which  designed  and  oversees
TensorFlow) continues building out its Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) hardware/software AI stack.
For now, CUDA is widely seen as the de facto choice for AI frameworks. As the cofounder of Py-
Torch  Soumith  Chintala  put  it  in  2023, “The  CUDA  monopoly  is  nowhere  close  to  being  broken
and CUDA will continue to be the key dependency for PyTorch.” For more, see Soumith Chintala,

It’s Not Just Chips: How Huawei Seeks to Compete
across the AI “Stack”—Continued

Huawei  is  not  just  targeting  advanced  semiconductors  but  is
also  seeking  to  establish  its  own  “flywheel”  to  displace  NVID-
IA’s  dominance.100  Like  NVIDIA,  Huawei’s AI “tech  stack”  starts
with  its  hardware  (the  Ascend  family  of  AI  chips)  atop  of  which
is  a  CUDA-like  layer  of  software  known  as  CANN  (Compute Ar-
chitecture  for  Neural  Networks).101  Atop  of  CANN,  Huawei  has
also  released  MindSpore,  an  open  source  AI  framework  of  soft-
ware  similar  to  the  popular  PyTorch  and  TensorFlow  AI  frame-
work software used to create LLMs and other AI technologies.102
Though  PyTorch  and  TensorFlow  are  also  open  source,  Huawei
needs an alternative because PyTorch and TensorFlow are largely
integrated with CUDA and as a contingency should the U.S. gov-
ernment ever block access to PyTorch and Tensorflow.* 103

In the short term, Huawei still trails NVIDIA and its AI hard-
ware/software “stack.”  NVIDIA  alone  has  developed  600 AI  mod-
els; and four million developers currently use CUDA software for
training  AI.104  Programmers  in  China  also  have  concerns  about
Huawei’s CANN, reporting large-scale issues with bugs, software
glitches,  and  general  inferiority  to  NVIDIA’s  CUDA.† 105  Mind-
Spore  also  trails  more  popular  open  source  AI  frameworks  such
as PyTorch. While the Chinese Academy of Information and Com-
munications Technology (CAICT) has noted that MindSpore is the
most popular AI framework domestically within China, it admits
that PyTorch and TensorFlow are a “duopoly” internationally.106
However, in the long run, Huawei’s attempts to recreate NVID-
IA’s “flywheel” via an integrated AI hardware/software stack bears
close attention. As of July 2023, Huawei claimed that the number
of  Ascend  and  CANN  developers  had  doubled  from  a  year  prior
and  reached  1.8  million.107  Huawei  has  also  stated  that  nearly
half  of  all  large  language  models  in  China  are  currently  trained
on its Ascend (hardware)/CANN (software) AI ecosystem.‡ 108

Mobile  technology  provides  an  instructive  example  of  how
Huawei  has  leveraged  privileged  access  to  China’s  massive  do-
mestic  market  and  various  types  of  state  support  to  overcome
technological  hurdles,  accelerate  adoption,  and  continue  to  pur-

* Though there are other layers of the AI stack, the relationship between hardware (chips) and
software  (CUDA/CANN)  to AI  frameworks  (PyTorch/MindSpore)  that  rely  on  them  is  critical  for
understanding NVIDIA and Huawei’s “flywheels”.

† China’s  own  developers  are  still  heavily  reliant  on  CUDA,  with  prominent  Chinese  chip
startups  like  Moore Threads  and  Denglin  using  or  accessing  CUDA.  Jeff  Pao, “‘China’s  NVIDIA’

sue  technological  leadership.*  The  United  States  added  Huawei
to  the  Entity  List  in  May  2019,  restricting  access  of  Huawei  to
various  products  and  technologies,  including  semiconductors,  the
licensed version of Android (which was the operating system [OS]
underlying  Huawei’s  handsets),  Android  OS  updates,  and  access
to  Google  apps  and  services.109  Leading  U.S.  tech  publications
that saw Huawei as a leading manufacturer of low-cost hardware
were  concerned  that  the Android  ban,  in  particular,  would  irrep-
arably  harm  the  company  moving  forward.110  Huawei’s  domestic
Android alternative, Harmony OS (HongMeng), was dismissed by
Western critics as a glorified “fork” that relied on Android’s  open
source software, which would face myriad challenges in becoming
a viable rival to Android.111

Five  years  later,  however,  the  pairing  of  Harmony  OS  with
China’s  export  control-defying  hardware  (the  Kirin  9000  chip)
has  been  a  key  reason  Huawei  has  continued  to  remain  com-
petitive in the handset space.112 Harmony OS currently is used
on over 900 million devices globally; 2.5 million developers are
working  on  apps  for  the  Harmony  OS  platform,  and  Huawei
targets  one  million  apps  for  the  OS  in  the  near  future.113 The
company’s  next  mobile  operating  system,  HarmonyOS  NEXT,
scheduled to debut October 2024, will remove its Android open
source  code,  making  it  a  fully  independent  mobile  operating
system.114

China  has  made  progress  in  expanding  “legacy”  or  “mature
node”  semiconductor  production.  Semiconductor  Manufactur-
ing  International  Corporation  (SMIC)  has  become  the  world’s
third-largest  foundry  and  is  prominent  in  “mature  node,”  or  28
nm  and  above  chip  production.115  These  chips  are  less  demand-
ing in wafer production and are made with older-generation deep
ultraviolet lithography equipment.116 China is rapidly expanding
production capacity for these semiconductors, which are crucial to
a  wide  range  of  commercial  products.  According  to  one  estimate,
China  is  on  pace  to  add  more  than  18  new  chip  fabs  in  2024
alone.117 The Information Technology and Innovation Foundation
estimates  that  between  2022  and  2026,  China  will  bring  26  new
fabs  online,  a  majority  of  which  will  build  legacy  chips.118  Ac-
cording  to  Silverado  Policy Accelerator, “China  has  the  most  fabs
expected  to  come  online  during  2022–26,  which  will  result  in  it
having the most both 200 mm and 300 mm wafer capacity in the
world”  and  “as  of  March  2023,  [China]  accounted  for  32  percent
[the world’s largest share] of current and planned capacity for 20
to  180  nm  semiconductors  (excluding  memory).” 119

* On  a  related  point,  Huawei’s  continued  status  as  the  global  leader  in  5G  technology—as  of
2023 it is still the number one provider globally—suggests limits to U.S. technology controls and
related efforts to limit the spread of national security-sensitive Chinese technology. 5G has some
important differences, however, given that Huawei was already the global leader in this technolo-
gy before the imposition of U.S. controls. Daniel Chiang and Vyra Wu, “Huawei vs. Samsung: Who
Leads the Global Communication Equipment Race?” DigiTimes, April 17, 2024.

186

The  Silverado  production  capacity  estimates  were  made  in  Oc-
tober  2023;  since  then,  China’s  imports  of  semiconductor  manu-
facturing  equipment  surged  to  new  highs  for  calendar  year  2023
and  are  on  pace  to  surpass  that  in  2024.  In  2023,  China  was  the
largest global importer of semiconductor manufacturing equipment,
importing  $42.5  billion,  almost  $15  billion  more  than  Taiwan,  the
second-largest  importer.120 According  to  data  from  China’s  General
Administration  of  Customs,  Chinese  imports  of  chip  equipment  in
the  first  seven  months  of  2024  hit  a  new  high,  totaling  $26  bil-
lion.121 Lithography tools, in particular, are a key piece of semicon-
ductor  manufacturing  equipment  for  which  China  currently  has  no
significant domestic alternative, with only an estimated 1 to 1.2 per-
cent  of  lithography  tools  manufactured  domestically.122  In  the  past
five  years,  China  has  imported  444  lithography  machines  from  EU
trading partners (predominantly the Netherlands) and $27.4 billion
dollars’  worth  of  semiconductor  manufacturing  equipment  in  2023,
an increase of nearly 50 percent from the prior year.* 123

Given  limitations  on  advanced  semiconductor  manufacturing
equipment  sales,  China  is  constantly  pursuing  legal  and  illegal
means  to  acquire  semiconductor  manufacturing  equipment.124  On
its  own,  China  is  not  likely  to  catch  up  at  scale  on  high-end  AI
chips,  at  least  not  using  current  technology.125  SMIC  and  Yangtze
Memory Technologies  Corp  (YMTC)  are  still  dependent  on Western
equipment, especially for making more high-end semiconductors.126
Unless  China  can  solve  the “yield”  problem  inherent  in  using  older
equipment to produce more advanced semiconductors, it is not likely
to  be  able  to  produce  AI-caliber  chips  in  quantities  needed  for  the
massive  expansion  in  AI  demand  that  is  projected.127  It  is  worth
noting,  though,  that  total  AI  infrastructure  demands  for  national
security  uses  are  likely  a  fraction  of  those  needed  for  the  broader
commercial market.

Legacy Semiconductors Underpin Wide Variety of
Modern Technologies; Significant Risk of Overcapacity
Glut from China

Although  the  world’s  most  cutting-edge  semiconductors  are  at
the  forefront  of  advancements  in AI, “legacy”  semiconductors  are
critical  for  a  whole  host  of  other  technologies.†  Legacy  chips  are
pervasive and essential, as they can be found in nearly every elec-
tronic device ranging from automobiles, fighter jets, drones, med-
ical  devices,  smartphones,  computers,  industrial  equipment,  sci-
entific equipment, communications devices, sensors, and more.128

* The complexity of these machines cannot be overstated. The latest extreme ultraviolet lithog-
raphy machines produced by ASML are “the size of a bus, but so accurate they could direct a laser
to  hit  a  golf  ball  as  far  away  as  the  Moon.”  Lucy  Rodgers  et  al.,  “Inside  the  Miracle  of  Modern
Chip Manufacturing,” Financial Times, February 28, 2024,

† Chips  are  categorized  based  on  their  function.  Analog  chips  are  used  to  capture  real-world
wave  signals  such  as  those  used  in  sound  amplification,  energy  regulation,  some  sensors,  and
surveillance  equipment.  The  most  sophisticated  category  is  logic  chips,  which  process  data  and
conduct computing functions, with applications in smartphones, AI and advanced computing, and
the  automotive  industry.  Logic  chips  are  differentiated  further  based  on  performance,  which  is
related to the distance between circuits, or nodes. Generally, chips below the 10-nanometer node
threshold are considered advanced, with smaller nodes allowing for more transistors to be packed
onto  a  chip  to  increase  computational  speed  and  power.  Lin  Jones  et  al.,  “U.S.  Exposure  to  the
Taiwanese Semiconductor Industry,” U.S. International Trade Commission, November 2023, 5.

Legacy Semiconductors Underpin Wide Variety of
Modern Technologies; Significant Risk of Overcapacity
Glut from China—Continued

In some cases, mature node chips are used alongside leading-edge
processors  to  power  these  technologies;  in  others,  only  “legacy”
chips are needed.129

Currently,  the  legacy  semiconductor  supply  chain  is  fairly  di-
versified,  but  China  already  plays  an  important  role  in  it.  China
accounted  for  31  percent  of  global  legacy  chip  production  at  the
end  of  2023,  and  in  a  few  years  it  is  projected  to  become  the
leading global producer of 200 mm to 300 mm semiconductors.130
According  to  a  May  2024  report  by  Rhodium  Group,  China  not
only has more capacity than any other country in analog, discrete,
mixed-signal,  and  power  chips,  it  is  also  expanding  production
capacity in those chips faster and at a larger scale than any other
country.131

Legacy  chips  have  also  been  an  important  source  of  techno-
logical power bolstering Russia’s war against Ukraine. According
to  a  June  2024  New York Times  report,  an  expansive  network  of
illicit  exporters  operating  in  China  and  several  other  countries
has  managed  to  ship  an  estimated  $4  billion  worth  of  restricted
integrated circuits to Russia since its invasion of Ukraine. Many
of  these  come  from  Chinese  companies  shipping  via  shell  com-
panies  in  Hong  Kong,  helping  “China  emerg[e]  as  the  dominant
chip  supplier  to  Russia.” 132  Despite  not  being  suitable  for  ad-
vanced  military  technologies  such  as  AI,  legacy  semiconductors
have  been  found  in  a  host  of  Russian  weapons  and  are  a  critical
dual-use  technology  for  Russia’s  war  efforts.  (For  more  informa-
tion on China’s sales of integrated circuits to Russia, see Chapter
1, “U.S.-China Economic and Trade Relations (Year in Review).”)

If  past  is  prologue,  once  China’s  massive  new  semiconductor
fabrication capacity comes online, China may flood the world with
cheap legacy semiconductors, forcing prices down.133 In turn, this
could  threaten  the  viability  of  other  countries’  legacy  semicon-
ductor  industries  and  provide  China  significant  global  econom-
ic  leverage.134  According  to  Jimmy  Goodrich,  nonresident  fellow
at  the  University  of  California’s  Institute  on  Global  Conflict  and
Cooperation,  “Already,  Chinese  foundries  are  engaged  in  a  price
war  with  their  domestic  competitors  that  has  spilled  over  to  im-
pact  similar  firms  in Taiwan  and  South  Korea.” 135 This  scenario
echoes the first “China shock” and highlights rising concerns that
China’s economic model is premised on investing in excess capac-
ity and relying on global markets to absorb the exports.136

China  Seeks  to  Close  the  Gap  with  the  United  States  in  Total

Compute Power

The  rise  in  demand  for  AI  has  come  with  a  corresponding  need
for  greater  compute  power,  as  training  models  require  a  substan-
tial  amount  of  data  and  compute-intensive  resources  provided  by

188

advanced  semiconductors.* 137  In  this  context,  compute  power,  com-
puting  power,  or  “compute”  generally  refers  to  national-level  or
company-level  infrastructure,  capabilities,  and  resources  dedicated
to  computational  power  and  data  processing.138 These  may  include
the development and use of computing systems, data centers, cloud
computing  facilities,  and  networks  that  support  high-end  computa-
tional  tasks.139 The  United  States  currently  has  a  lead  in  compute
power  over  China.  Experts  assess  that  one  of  the  factors  contribut-
ing  to  the  status  of  U.S.-based  companies—including  OpenAI,  Goo-
gle,  and  Meta—as  some  of  the  dominant  players  in  the  global  AI
landscape  is  their  preferential  access  to  compute.140  In  particular,
these  three  companies  are  building  compute  infrastructure  using
tens  or  even  hundreds  of  thousands  of  advanced  NVIDIA  GPUs,
including  the  cutting-edge  GH100.141  According  to  Paul  Triolo,  the
senior  vice  president  for  China  and  technology  policy  lead  at  Al-
bright  Stonebridge  Group,  and  Kendra  Schaefer,  a  partner  at Triv-
ium China and nonresident fellow at the National Bureau of Asian
Research, “Amassing so many advanced GPUs is largely out of reach
for  Chinese  technology  platforms  and  start-ups,”  and  in  contrast  to
their  U.S.  counterparts,  many  Chinese  AI  players  struggle  to  find
access  to  investment  and  compute.142  The  U.S.  export  controls  on
advanced  semiconductors  will  help  the  United  States  maintain  its
compute power lead because such semiconductors allow for new sys-
tems  with  significantly  faster  and  larger  total  compute  loads  nec-
essary  for  the  demands  of  AI.  As  such,  U.S.  export  controls  have
complicated  China’s  long-term  capacity  to  keep  up  with  the  United
States in compute.143

Chinese  government  efforts  to  expand  national  computing  pow-
er  networks  and  optimize  resource  efficiency  are  key  to  China’s AI
self-reliance  drive,  and  Beijing  has  taken  multiple  policy  actions  in
recent years to improve its computing capabilities. In 2021, China’s
National  Development  and  Reform  Commission  announced  plans
to  optimize  and  integrate  computing  resources  across  the  country
through  the  (still  under  construction)  National  Integrated  Comput-
ing Power Network.† 144 Chinese government departments set a tar-
get  in  October  2023  to  increase  the  country’s  aggregate  computing
power  from  197  EFLOPs  (a  measure  of  computing  speed  equal  to
1  quintillion  floating-point  operations  per  second)  to  300  EFLOPs
between 2023 and 2025, constituting a 50 percent increase.145 MIIT
claimed in October 2023 that China’s compute power ranked second
behind  the  United  States,  but  it  did  not  provide  a  number  for  its
estimate  of  U.S.  computing  power.146  In  May  2024,  China  launched
a  three-year  action  plan  to  strengthen  standards  in  cutting-edge

* Technologies like high bandwidth memory also allow for faster transfers of data within chips.
China  has  also  acknowledged  that  it  lacks  a  fully  indigenous  high-bandwidth  memory  supply
chain. Aside from two U.S.-sanctioned companies, China does not have any large-scale high-band-
width memory producers. Boston Consulting Group, “The Race for Advanced AI Chips,” April 17,

technologies, including national computing power, which will in part
focus  on  enhancing  computing  power  infrastructure  standards  and
strengthening basic standards for data resources.147

A critical aspect of compute is cloud computing. The United States
leads on cloud computing, but China has made it a priority to catch
up.  Cloud  computing  allows  computing  power  to  be  made  available
to a wider range of users remotely.* It is a “crucial behind-the-scenes
engine of the digital economy . . . allowing companies to run artificial
intelligence  programs.” 148  It  is  also  a  major  driver  of  economic  ac-
tivity  and  technological  innovation  in  both  the  United  States  and
China.  Domestically,  the  United  States  is  the  world’s  largest  cloud
market, with its public cloud market expected to exceed $430 billion
in 2024.† 149 U.S. companies currently lead the global cloud comput-
ing  market,  with  Amazon  (32  percent),  Microsoft  (23  percent),  and
Google  (12  percent)  on  their  own  making  up  a  67  percent  global
market share.150

Within  China,  Alibaba,  Huawei,  and  Tencent  control  72  percent
of  China’s  protected  domestic  cloud  market.‡ 151  China’s  cloud  mar-
ket  is  the  world’s  second-largest  market,  with  the  Chinese  govern-
ment-backed  think  tank  CAICT  calculating  China’s  2023  domestic
cloud  market  size  at  $85  billion  and  predicting  it  will  reach  $293
billion  by  2027.152  Currently,  both  Microsoft  and  Amazon  AWS  op-
erate  cloud  services  in  China,  with  Microsoft  offering  services  un-
der a wholly owned subsidiary of local company 21Vianet and AWS
China  partnering  with  local  companies  Sinnet  and  NWCD  to  offer
data center services.153 An Amazon executive for Greater China re-
portedly  stated  in  June  2024  that AWS “is  committed  to  long-term
investments in China, and will focus on offering generative artificial
intelligence technology and helping Chinese enterprises in their dig-
ital transformation.” 154

In  terms  of  international  presence,  China’s  cloud  providers  cur-
rently trail U.S. firms by a significant margin. China’s big three cloud
companies  only  make  up  roughly  8  percent  of  global  cloud  market
share,  led  by  Alibaba  (4  percent  global  market  share),  Tencent  (2
percent), and Huawei (2 percent).155 Chinese companies are seeking
to  make  significant  inroads,  however,  in  expanding  cloud  presence
in  developing  and  lower-income  countries.  Though  Chinese  compa-
nies  do  not  publish  their  total  data  center  figures,  China’s  three
largest  cloud  providers  have  listed  their  international  (non-China)
“availability  zones”:  clusters  of  data  centers  offering  cloud  service.
Between Huawei (33), Alibaba (28), and Tencent (22), China’s cloud
leaders operate 81 data center cluster “availability zones” outside of
China.156  Southeast  Asia  is  currently  where  Alibaba  (10)  and  Ten-

centration  of  availability  zones  in  Mexico  and  South  America  (12),
followed  closely  by  Southeast  Asia  (10).* 157  With  Southeast  Asia’s
cloud  computing  market  predicted  to  hit  $40.3  billion  by  2025,  U.S.
and Chinese cloud firms are positioning to battle over market share
throughout  the  region.158 As  Bridge  Song,  the VP  of Alibaba  Cloud
Intelligence International, publicly stated September 2024, “The pri-
mary strategic market of Alibaba Cloud has always been Southeast
Asia.” 159 China tech analyst Kevin Xu pointed out in July 2023 that
in  this  “battle,”  the  data  center  buildout  of  Chinese  companies  at
that  time  far  outpaced  U.S.  cloud  providers,  with  Amazon  having
data  centers  only  in  Indonesia  and  Malaysia;  Google  only  offering
data  centers  in  Singapore  and  Indonesia;  and  Microsoft  offering
cloud services only in Singapore, with plans to build data centers in
Indonesia and Malaysia.160

Data storage will be increasingly important as both the United States
and China are set to produce more and more data. By 2025, China is
predicted to generate more data than the United States, producing 48.6
zettabytes  to  an  estimated  30.6  zettabytes  for  the  United  States.161
Managing and storing this amount of data for both the United States
and China will require an enormous amount of physical infrastructure
and  energy.  China  is  seeking  to  address  these  challenges  by  simulta-
neously building out data storage and optimizing electrical infrastruc-
ture  layout  for  data  centers.  (For  more  on  this,  please  see  the  textbox
on “The Eastern Data Western Computing (EDWC) and China’s Data
Center Buildout” later in this chapter.)

This  growth  coincides  with  a  Party-state  push  that  sees  cloud  as
essential  to  China’s  national  security,  technological,  and  economic
goals.  Leading  government  organizations  such  as  the  State  Council
and  MIIT  have  highlighted  cloud  adoption  as  a  key  component  of
strategic “five-year  plans”  involving  the  long-term  direction  of  tech-
nology and the economy.† 162 Cloud is also crucial to state-led goals
for  increasing  compute  through  infrastructure  as  a  service  (IaaS),
with  the  construction  of  cloud  facilities  and  data  center  nodes  as
the backbone of China’s massive “Eastern Data Western Computing”
(EDWC) project.163 Besides the EDWC, China’s state asset manager,
the  State-Owned  Assets  Supervision  and  Administration  Commis-
sion  of  the  State  Council  (SASAC),  has  launched  a “national  cloud”
available  for  use  by  China’s  state-owned  enterprises.164  Finally,  at
the  provincial  level,  companies  like  Alicloud  have  been  partnering
with  key  municipalities  such  as  Hangzhou,  Tianjin,  and  Shenzhen
in  efforts  to  strengthen  their  local  cloud  computing  infrastructure
for  data  exchanges  that  China  sees  as  essential  to  its  “new  digital
economy.” ‡ 165

* Until  recently,  Alibaba  also  operated  cloud  data  centers  in  Australia  and  India  (two  zones
each for four zones total); however, as of 2024, these plants are planning to cease operation. Mu-

† China’s tech firms are not the only players in its cloud computing market; as of July 2024, at
least 16 local governments in China have offered companies coupons to access processing power
at subsidized prices at large state-run data centers where scarce supplies of advanced chips have
been pooled. Also, U.S. tech companies like Amazon and Microsoft continue to provide cloud ser-
vices  in  China.  Liza  Lin, “China  Puts  Power  of  State  behind AI—and  Risks  Strangling  It,”  Wall

Eastern Data Western Computing (EDWC) and China’s
Data Center Buildout
China  is  reshaping  a  significant  part  of  its  domestic  develop-
ment  program  in  order  to  create  the  infrastructure  for  the  com-
pute, data center capacity, and electrical power requirements nec-
essary  for  advanced  technologies  such  as  AI.  Current  estimates
indicate  China’s  domestic  data  centers  consume  roughly  200  ter-
awatt  hours  (TWh)  of  electricity  now,  set  to  grow  to  roughly  300
TWh by 2025 and 380 TWh by 2030.* 166 China’s Ministry of Ecol-
ogy  and  Environment  has  estimated  that  the  share  of  national
energy consumption by data centers will rise from 1.5–1.9 percent
circa 2020 to over 5 percent by 2030.167

China  has  developed  a  plan  to  meet  the  growing  demand  for
data  center  compute  while  potentially  contributing  to  regional
development  needs.  China’s  eastern  regions,  where  current  data
centers  are  concentrated,  already  face  high  electricity  prices  and
strained  electrical  grids.† 168  These  problems  in  Eastern  China
contrast  sharply  to  the  situation  of  Western  China,  which  has
severely underdeveloped data center infrastructure but abundant
and cheap energy as well as land.169 (For more on China’s energy
needs and constraints, see Chapter 7, “China’s New Measures for
Control, Mobilization, and Resilience.”)

To solve this imbalance of data center power needs and relative
cost  structures,  China  has  spent  the  past  several  years  imple-
menting  a  grand  realignment  plan  for  its  digital  infrastructure:
the Eastern Data Western Computing (EDWC) project. The EDWC
envisions  a  massive  buildout  of  data  centers  and  cloud  facilities
in  western  provinces  with  abundant  (green,  low-carbon)  energy
resources,  such  as  Inner  Mongolia,  Ningxia,  and  Guizhou.‡ 170
Since being formally codified as national-level policy in 2021, the
National  Development  Reform  Commission  issued  a  joint  order
along with numerous other government entities to accelerate the
EDWC implementation and buildout.171

The EDWC also is intended to advance China’s long-term goal
of  increasing  the  availability  of  computing  power  through  a “na-
tionally integrated computing power network,” or NICPN, that is

* A  terrawatt  hour  is  the  amount  of  power  generated  by  a  1-terawatt  generator  (or  multiple
lower-power generators equivalent to a 1-terawatt generator) for one hour. To put these terms on
a  human  scale,  1  gigawatt  is  enough  to  power  approximately  750,000  U.S.  homes  for  one  year.
1,000 Gigawatts = 1 Terrawatt. Zach Stein, “What Is a Terawatt Hour (TWh)?,” Carbon Collective,

Nukes?” ChinaTalk, September 12, 2024.

† Power consumption is a major concern for data center operators, with some academics placing
power consumption at 70 percent of a data center’s operational expenses. For a general sense of
China’s  power  consumption  and  generation  at  a  national  level,  a  useful  comparison  comes  from
Reuter’s market analyst John Kemp: “Ten provincial-level areas in the east and south (Liaoning,
Hebei, Beijing, Tianjin, Shandong, Jiangsu, Shanghai, Zhejiang, Fujian and Guangdong) account-
ed  for  50%  of  national  consumption  but  only  40%  of  generation  in  2022.  By  contrast,  six  remote
and sparsely populated northern and western areas (Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, Shanxi, Shaanxi,
Gansu  and  Ningxia)  accounted  for  18%  of  consumption  but  25%  of  generation.”  Ning  Zhang  et

Eastern Data Western Computing (EDWC) and China’s
Data Center Buildout—Continued
currently  under  construction.172  The  NICPN  seeks  to  pool  and
allocate  compute  from  the  EDWC’s  interconnected  data  centers
as  well  as  existing  data  centers  in  order  to  boost  China’s  overall
computing power and increase the effectiveness of how it is allo-
cated.173 Newly appointed head of the National Data Administra-
tion  (NDA)  Liu  Liehong  cites  the  NICPN  as  crucial  for  meeting
the  computing  power  needs  of  advanced  technologies  like  gener-
ative AI.174

As  of  June  2024,  Liu  Liehong  announced  that  China’s  govern-
ment  had  invested  roughly  $6.2  billion  in  the  project,  with  ad-
ditional  funding  of  more  than  $28.4  billion  from  other  sources,
including  the  private  sector.175  Early  analysis  reveals  the  data
centers’ “primary operators” will be China’s big three state-owned
telecoms, with China Mobile investing $6.4 billion, China Telecom
investing  $4.9  billion,  and  China  Unicom  investing  $3  billion.176
China tech champions Huawei and Alibaba have also made major
investments  in  the  project,  with  estimated  financing  of  $4.7  bil-
lion and $3 billion, respectively.177

While the EDWC program faces some challenges over demand,
cost,  and  latency,  China’s  government  believes  the  EDWC  and
NICPN can boost China’s capacity in data center technology, com-
puting power, and the digital economy, particularly as energy de-
mands from data centers for AI increase.178 The United States is
now  making  efforts  to  ensure  that  it  maintains  a  strategic  lead
in compute by meeting with leading AI, AI GPU, and data center
companies  to  discuss  how  the  United  States  can  rapidly  build
out  its  data  center  infrastructure  and  provide  energy  resources
to meet the needs of these technologies.179

Access  to  compute  via  cloud  computing  complicates  and  inter-
nationalizes  U.S.-China  AI-related  competition.  Cloud  computing
can  be  an  effective  way  to  circumvent  export  controls  on  advanced
chips,  as  it  allows  remote  access  to  the  computing  power  enabled
by  such  chips.*  Since  the  chips  themselves  are  not  exported  in  a
cloud  computing  service,  export  controls  are  not  necessarily  impli-
cated  at  all.180  For  example,  Chinese  companies  targeted  by  U.S.
sanctions  have  found  workarounds  to  obtain  access  to  restricted
U.S.  AI  technology  by  using  third-party  cloud  providers  and  rental
arrangements.181  iFlytek,  a  state-backed  voice  recognition  compa-
ny  blacklisted  by  Washington  in  2019,  has  been  renting  access  to
NVIDIA’s A100 chips.182 According to an investigative report by Re-
uters  in  August  2024,  Chinese  state-linked  entities  were  accessing

* Remote access to compute power is also a potential issue for quantum computing. According to
Edward Parker with RAND Corporation, “Many quantum computing companies do not sell hard-
ware  but  instead  operate  under  a  cloud-access  model  whereby  customers  submit  tasks  remotely
and  the  companies  perform  the  actual  computations  in-house.  Any  export  controls  on  quantum
computing should clearly address the permissibility of selling computing services to foreign cus-
tomers,  even  if  no  physical  hardware  ever  leaves  the  United  States.”  Edward  Parker,  written

controlled  NVIDIA  chips  for  AI  training  via  AWS  and  other  cloud
providers.183 Also in August 2024, the Wall Street Journal reported
on  a  company  in  Australia  which,  with  the  help  of  investors  from
Dubai  and  the  United  States,  set  up  a  cloud  service  powered  by
NVIDIA’s  advanced  H100  chips  at  least  in  part  to  process AI  algo-
rithms for Chinese-based companies.184 An executive at the compa-
ny explained the decision to target China: “There is demand. There
is profit. Naturally someone will provide the supply.” 185

The  United  States  has  begun  to  explore  how  to  combat  China’s
use  of  cloud  computing  for  access  to  AI  technologies,  but  solutions
to  date  all  have  significant  limitations.  First,  to  prevent  Chinese
companies from simply setting up AI infrastructure outside of China
and  using  it  there  (or  making  it  available  in  China),  existing  ex-
port controls on advanced semiconductors apply to Chinese entities
even when they are operating overseas.186 Second, so-called “U.S.
persons”  authority  would  prevent  U.S.  cloud  providers  from  know-
ingly providing services that contribute to certain specified national
security  risks,  including  helping  Chinese  entities  obtain  access  to
advanced  semiconductor  technology.* 187  Third,  on  an  ad  hoc  basis,
the  U.S.  government  appears  to  be  using  various  points  of  leverage
to  persuade  domestic  technology  providers  and  their  potential  for-
eign partners that want access to the most advanced semiconductor
technology to take measures to exclude Chinese entities.188 Fourth,
the United States has proposed “know your customer” rules and re-
porting  requirements  for  domestic  cloud  providers  when  their  ser-
vices  are  used  by  foreign  entities  to  train  large AI  models.189  Each
of  these  rules  or  proposals,  however,  has  some  limitations  in  scope,
coverage,  and/or  comprehensiveness—for  example,  applying  only  to
Chinese  companies,  only  to  U.S.  companies,  or  only  on  an  ad  hoc
basis.† There is currently no comprehensive authority akin to export
controls  for  broadly  restricting  access  to  cloud  services  reliant  on
U.S. technology.

* Originally,  the  “U.S  persons”  authority  only  applied  to  limit  activities  of  U.S.  persons  that
contribute  to  proliferation  of  weapons  of  mass  destruction.  ECRA  expanded  the  coverage  to  in-
clude  support  for  “foreign  military  intelligence  services.”  Congress  significantly  expanded  this
authority  again  in  2022  to  allow  BIS  to  prohibit  U.S.  persons  from  knowingly  providing  support
to adversarial foreign military services, intelligence services, and security services. In July 2024,
BIS  proposed  a  rule  to  implement  the  new  authority  that  would  significantly  expand  the  scope
of  “U.S.  persons”  restrictions  to  cover  a  broad  class  of  “foreign  security  end  users.”  According  to
Gibson, Dunn, & Crutcher LLP, a multinational law firm, the breadth of the restrictions will likely
necessitate  the  enhancement  of  company  diligence  efforts  to  better  understand  end  users,  with
cloud service providers potentially needing to ensure that U.S. persons are not providing prohib-
ited services or support for restricted parties. U.S. Department of Commerce Bureau of Industry

transactions  with  an  adversary,  including  the  provision  of  certain  cloud  services.  Specifically,  in
response  to  Russia’s  war  of  aggression  against  Ukraine,  the  U.S.  Department  of  the  Treasury’s

 CCP Control and Xi Jinping Thought May Constrain
China’s AI Models

China risks inhibiting its AI ambitions by its tight regulations
on  LLMs.  Heavily  censored  datasets  can  lead  to  biases  in  AI
models and limit their ability to handle certain tasks.190 In April
2023, the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) unveiled its
draft measures on generative AI services.191 The CAC will require
companies  to  go  through  a  government  security  review  process
and make companies responsible for the content their AI services
generate, such as prohibiting content the CCP views as politically
sensitive,  including  arbitrary  and  broad  definitions  of  subverting
state power, inciting secession, or disrupting social order.192 Addi-
tionally,  the  CAC  requires  companies  to  test  whether  the  models
can provide “safe” answers to users by preparing between 20,000
and  70,000  questions.193  Companies  must  also  submit  a  dataset
of  5,000  to  10,000  questions  the  model  will  decline  to  answer,
roughly  half  of  which  relate  to  political  ideology  and  criticism  of
the Communist Party.194 Xu Chenggang, a senior research schol-
ar  at  the  Stanford  Center  on  China’s  Economy  and  Institutions,
has asserted that China’s strict censorship rules could inhibit the
quality  of  data  and  the  development  of  chatbots,  stating  that “if
there are restrictions everywhere in the setup of your algorithms,
of course its ability will be restricted.” 195

China is also developing a closed-source LLM based on Xi Jin-
ping’s political philosophy in a move that demonstrates the CCP’s
desire to experiment with centralized control over AI as a strate-
gic asset. The machine learning language model was launched by
the  China  Cyberspace  Research  Institute,  which  operates  under
the  CAC.196  Answers  are  sourced  from  a  fixed  pool  of  Chinese
official  documents  and  outlets.197  The  model  is  still  undergoing
internal testing and was not yet available for public use, but it is
open to “designated users by invitation,” according to the CAC.198

China Seeks to Create Advanced Generative AI Models to Outcompete

the United States

The  third  element  of  AI  competition  is  the  quality  of  generative
AI models. Generative AI models can transmit algorithms into text,
images,  audio,  video,  and  code,  enabling  the  creation  of  new  con-
tent.199  Although  assessing  AI  models  “is  an  art,  not  a  science . . .
making  it  difficult  to  compare  Chinese  models  with  global  leaders,”
most experts believe the United States currently leads China in this
space.200 China’s demonstrations of its generative AI models in early
2023 failed to outperform U.S. models like ChatGPT.201 Baidu’s ER-
NIE  Bot  launch,  which  relied  on  prerecorded  examples  rather  than
a  live  demonstration,  was  largely  seen  as  a  flop.202  Erniebot  and
Alibaba’s Tongyi Qianwen also both performed worse than ChatGPT
in  writing  computer  code.* 203  More  than  a  dozen  tech  industry  in-

* For example, Robin Li, Baidu’s chief executive, admitted halfway through a “live” demonstra-
tion  of  Ernie  that  it  was  prerecorded.  In  June  2023,  however,  Baidu  claimed  that  its  Ernie  3.5
model outperformed OpenAI’s ChatGPT and GPT-4 across numerous metrics, such as answering
over 13,000 multiple-choice questions across 50 different subjects in Chinese more correctly. How-
ever, when the model took a separate test that was developed by a group of U.S. universities, the

195

siders and leading engineers interviewed by the New York Times in
February 2024 said the generative AI capabilities of Chinese compa-
nies still lag behind those of U.S. companies by at least a year, with
the article claiming that Chinese companies rely almost entirely on
underlying systems from the United States.204 In April 2024, Aliba-
ba chairman Joe Tsai said that Chinese firms lag behind U.S. peers
in AI development by at least two years.205

Chinese companies are making a concerted effort to develop gen-
erative  AI  models  similar  in  sophistication  to  those  of  U.S.  compa-
nies.206  China’s AI  development  landscape  is  diverse,  with  approxi-
mately 50 Chinese companies developing AI models as of June 2024,
compared  to  the  relatively  small  number  of  large  companies  in  the
United States that focus on developing models such as OpenAI, Goo-
gle,  and  others.207 As  of  late  September  2023,  China  accounted  for
40 percent of all LLMs in the world (while the United States has 50
percent), according to brokerage and investment group CLSA.208 By
June  2024,  analysts  asserted  that  by  some  metrics,  Baidu’s  ERNIE
Bot and Zhipu AI’s GLM-4 had reached a similar level of quality as
Open AI’s  GPT-4  model.  Due  to  the  evolution  of  leading-edge  mod-
els and soon-to-be-released models like GPT-5, these analysts assert
that  benchmarking  remains  a  moving  target,  which  may  also  pose
challenges for Chinese AI firms in developing metrics to assess their
own  capabilities.209  Baidu’s  CEO  Robin  Li  said  in  July  2024  that
there  are  “too  many”  LLMs  in  China,  which  he  says  have  resulted
in  a “significant  waste  of  resources,  particularly  computing  power”;
he also questioned how many of these have provided real-world ap-
plications that are beneficial.210

The Open vs. Closed Debate and U.S.-China Competition
As the United States and China compete for technological lead-
ership in AI, there have been concerns raised as to whether open
source AI  models  may  be  providing  Chinese  companies  access  to
advanced  AI  capabilities  that  would  not  otherwise  be  available,
allowing them to catch up to the United States more quickly.

The  debate  surrounding  the  use  of  open  source  models  and
closed  source  models  is  a  vigorous  one  within  the  industry,  even
apart  from  issues  around  China’s  access  to  the  technology. Advo-
cates  of  the  open  source  approach  argue  that  it  promotes  fast-

Ernie 3.5 model performed behind ChatGPT and GPT-4. Yasheng Huang, a professor of manage-
ment at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said of China’s efforts to build ChatGPT-level
chatbots  that “China  is  incredibly  good  at  scaling  an  existing  invention,  but  it  is  not  very  good
at  making  breakthroughs.”  The  Ernie  bot  has  still  become  a  popular  option  for  generative  AI
use,  as  Baidu  claimed  in  April  2024  that  its  platform  has  over  200  million  users.  Additionally,
the  Beijing Academy  of Artificial  Intelligence’s WuDao  2.0,  released  in  the  summer  of  2021,  was
touted by Forbes as a “bigger, stronger, faster AI” due to having ten times more parameters (the
numbers inside an AI model that determine how it processes information) than GPT-3. However,
AI experts Helen Toner, Jenny Xiao, and Jeffrey Ding assert that having more parameters “does
not make one AI system better than another” if it is not matched with corresponding increases in
data and computing power, and they also argue that the Chinese researchers who posed questions
to  the  model  helped  boost  its  performance  to  appear  stronger.  Tracy  Qu,  “Baidu  Says  Ernie  AI

The Open vs. Closed Debate and U.S.-China Competition—
Continued
er  innovation  by  allowing  a  wider  range  of  users  to  customize
it,  build  upon  it,  and  integrate  it  with  third-party  software  and
hardware.211 Open model advocates further argue that such mod-
els  reduce  market  concentration;  increase  transparency  to  help
evaluate  bias,  data  quality,  and  security  risks;  and  create  more
benefits  for  society  by  expanding  access  to  the  technology.212 Ad-
vocates of the closed source approach argue that such models are
better  able  to  protect  safety  and  prevent  abuse,  to  ensure  faster
development  cycles,  and  to  help  enterprises  maintain  an  edge  in
commercializing their innovations.213

From the standpoint of U.S.-China technology competition, how-
ever,  there  is  one  key  distinction:  open  models  allow  China  and
Chinese AI companies access to key U.S. AI technology and make
it easier for Chinese companies to build on top of U.S. technology.
In  July  2024,  OpenAI,  a  closed  model,  cut  off  China’s  access  to
its  services.214  This  move  would  not  have  been  possible  with  an
open  model;  open  models,  by  their  nature,  remain  open  to  Chi-
nese  entities  to  use,  explore,  learn  from,  and  build  upon.215 And,
indeed,  early  gains  in  China’s  AI  models  have  been  built  on  the
foundations  of  U.S.  technology—as  the  New  York  Times  report-
ed  in  February  2024, “Even  as  [China]  races  to  build  generative
A.I., Chinese companies are relying almost entirely on underlying
[open  model]  systems  from  the  United  States.” 216  In  July  2024,
at  the World Artificial  Intelligence  Conference  in  Shanghai,  Chi-
nese entities unveiled AI models they claimed rivaled leading U.S.
models.217 At the event, “a dozen technologists and researchers at
Chinese tech companies said open-source technologies were a key
reason  that  China’s  A.I.  development  has  advanced  so  quickly.
They  saw  open-source  A.I.  as  an  opportunity  for  the  country  to
take a lead.” 218

China Leverages Data for AI and Technological Supremacy

The U.S.-China competition in AI technology is dependent on who
can  procure  and  compile  large-scale,  high-quality  datasets  and  cre-
ate economic incentives and frameworks for sharing data. Access to
proprietary data in different sectors can be an increasingly import-
ant  source  of  competitive  advantage  because  better  results  can  be
acquired by more relevant, real-world data that can be used to train
the AI models, which has a net impact on the cycle and speed of in-
novation.219 With the rising importance of data to governments, cor-
porations,  and  next-generation  technologies  like  generative  AI  and
large models, data are quickly becoming the “new oil” that power AI
and the global economy.220

The Importance of Data to China’s Policymakers

Since  Xi’s  2012  appointment  as  China’s  President,  Party  leaders
have  swiftly  identified  data  as  a  critical  component  for  developing
China’s economic and technological capacity.221 This was formalized
as  policy  in  the  2016  State  Council  National  13th  Five-Year  Plan

197

for the Development of Strategic Emerging Industries, which called
for the construction of a “digital China” based upon  the integration
and  leveraging  of  data,  data  technology,  data  standards,  and  data
connectivity  throughout  China’s  economic  and  technological  infra-
structure.222 The  importance  of  data  was  further  highlighted  by  Xi
in subsequent Party speeches and study sessions, where he empha-
sized to policymakers that China must “build a digital economy with
data as a key enabler” and “promote the deepened integration of In-
ternet, big data, and artificial intelligence with the real economy.” 223
Building off these policies and presidential directives, in 2020, Chi-
na’s  State  Council  named  data  “factor[s]  of  production,”  codifying
data—along  with  land,  labor,  capital,  and  technology—as  crucial  to
China’s  economic  development  and  requiring  Party  supervision  to
ensure economic development and avoid market distortions.* 224

Efforts to Turn Data into a Factor of Production

Alongside  Xi’s  directives  and  official  policies  mandating  the  im-
portance  of  data,  in  March  2023,  China  established  a  new  govern-
ment administration: the National Data Administration (NDA).† 225
Since  its  formation,  the  NDA  has  been  given  economic  portfolio  re-
sponsibilities  that  were  previously  held  by  domestic  and  national
security-minded government organs, chiefly the Cyberspace Admin-
istration of China.226 So far, the economic mandate of the NDA has
been  to  establish  the  economic  value  of  data  assets,  increase  data
circulation  throughout  China,  and  develop  data  market  ecosystems
for key industrial fields such as smart manufacturing.227 The NDA’s
newly appointed leader, Liu Liehong, has also made it a point of em-
phasis to meet with China’s leading tech companies, such as iFlytek
and  Didi,  to  discuss  how  best  to  share,  monetize,  and  ensure  data
property rights on the vast amounts of data they hold.228

China’s data exchanges will be critical to the NDA’s efforts to turn
data  into  a  factor  of  production.  Broadly  speaking,  data  exchanges
are  centralized  markets  for  buying  and  selling  data,  data  products,
and data services.229 China’s first data exchange was set up in Gui-
yang  in  2015;  since  that  time,  48  data  exchanges  are  now  active  in
the  country.230  While  in  the  United  States  these  take  the  form  of
private  third-party  data  brokers  who  aggregate  public  or  private
data  for  sale,  China’s  data  exchanges  are  state-managed  by  local
governments,  with  the  goal  of  building  a  cohesive  national  “data
economy.” ‡   231  Alongside  data  exchanges,  China  has  also  experi-
mented  with  using  its  21  free  trade  zones  to  facilitate  companies
that  wish  to  export  “cross-border  data.” 232  While  still  in  the  early
stages,  the  development  of  China’s  data  exchanges  and  free  trade
zones  is  part  of  a  larger  goal  of  constructing  a  “big  data  industry,”

by the Party in order to avoid market distortions. Rebecca Arcesati, “China Activates Data in the
National Interest,” Mercator Institute for China Studies, July 4, 2022; Lillian Li, “Abridged: Data
as a Factor of Production,” Chinese Characteristics: Substack, November 4, 2021.

China’s  Authoritarian  Practices  May  Provide  an  Edge  in  Certain

Types of Data

China’s  efforts  to  create  a  national  data  economy  has  significant
implications  for  both  its  leading  technology  firms  and  the  develop-
ment of AI itself. Experts have debated the general advantages that
the  United  States  and  China  have  regarding  data  and  how  these
advantages may affect their AI capabilities. According to Matt Shee-
han,  a  fellow  at  the  Carnegie  Endowment  for  International  Peace,
in terms of quantity, China’s advantage mainly lies in the fact that
its  leading  tech  companies  have  many  more  windows  into  a  user’s
online  and  offline  behaviors.234  China  also  holds  an  advantage  in
terms of compiling data from public spaces, gathered from the coun-
try’s  vast  public  surveillance  network,  which  has  given  China’s  fa-
cial  recognition  AI  firms  some  advantages.235  Prominent  scholars
have  also  raised  concerns  that  China’s  “AI-Surveillance  symbiosis”
could  lead  to  a “feedback  loop”  with  data  derived  from  surveillance
leading to iterative improvements in AI innovation.236 Furthermore,
China’s  broad  government  collection  of  data  could  be  used  to  en-
hance the datasets of Chinese firms across a variety of other import-
ant  domains,  including  healthcare,  education,  and  basic  science.237
The prevalence of Chinese companies in genomics, agricultural, and
certain  health-related  biotechnology  supply  chains  could  provide  a
significant  data  advantage  in  generative  AI  models  geared  toward
those technologies. (For more information on recent developments in
China allowing local government entities to treat data as a financial
asset,  please  see  Chapter  1, “U.S.-China  Economic  and Trade  Rela-
tions (Year in Review).”)

U.S. companies and bureaucracies have a lead regarding the quali-
ty of data.238 China has not invested as much in enterprise software
or  digitizing  data,  although  this  may  change  over  time  as  Beijing
is  incentivizing  localities  to  digitize  records  and  adopt  AI-powered
analytical  tools.239  Regarding  diversity  of  data,  the  United  States
holds  a  clear  advantage  because  of  its  diverse  domestic  population
and the global user base of many Silicon Valley companies.240

Other Aspects of AI Competition: Workforce and Research Output

China  is  attempting  to  advance  its  AI  workforce  in  order  to
compete  with  the  United  States.  China  has  developed  AI  talent
partly because it invested heavily in AI education.* 241 China has
created over 2,000 undergraduate-level AI programs at more than
300  of  the  country’s  most  elite  universities  since  2018.242  Data
regarding  global  AI  talent  published  by  the  think  tank  Macro-
Polo  revealed  that  in  2022,  57  percent  of  “elite”  AI  researchers
(i.e.,  the  top  2  percent)  worked  in  the  United  States  as  opposed
to  12  percent  in  China,  compared  to  65  percent  and  less  than  3

* CSET reported in February 2023 that collectively, at least $40.2 billion in announced invest-
ments into 251 Chinese AI companies involved U.S. investors, though it was not clear what exact
portion  of  the  $40.2  billion  came  from  U.S.  investors  (e.g.,  an  announcement  may  list  multiple
investors  and  a  headline  number,  without  breaking  down  the  contribution  of  each).  Emily  S.

percent  in  2019,  respectively.243  For “top-tier”  talent  (i.e.,  the  top
20  percent),  42  percent  worked  in  the  United  States  in  2022  and
28  percent  in  China,  compared  to  59  percent  and  11  percent  in
2019.244  According  to  a  November  2023  report  by  CSET,  78  per-
cent of China’s AI-related job postings are geographically concen-
trated  in  three  economically  and  technologically  developed  hubs
with  large  population  centers,  including  the Yangtze  River  Delta
region, the Pearl River Delta, and the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei area,
while  other  provinces  with  relatively  high  demand  for  AI  talent
include  Hubei,  Shandong,  and  Hunan.245

Regarding AI research, the comparison between the United States
and  China  depends  on  the  metric  chosen.  China  leads  the  United
States  based  on  sheer  volume  of  research  published—with  575,258
articles  to  the  United  States’  359,415  articles.246 The  Commission’s
2023 Annual  Report  to  Congress  examined  at  length,  however,  why
publication  volume  is  a  flawed  metric  at  best  for  measuring  the
progress  of  Chinese  academia  in  advanced  technologies  like  AI.247
Plagiarism,  error,  and  fraud  have  long  plagued  Chinese  higher  ed-
ucation,  with  China  having  the  largest  retraction  rate  globally  of
submitted research papers, exceeding 20 per 10,000 papers submit-
ted.248 The number of citations and number of international research
collaborations may be better indicators of a country’s progress in AI
research. In these areas, the United States is still the global leader
as of September 2024, with U.S. AI papers receiving 13,296,404 cita-
tions compared to China’s 8,830,282 citations.249 The United States
also  leads  in  global AI  research  collaboration  with  132,672  articles
published  with  international  collaborators,  though  China  is  not  far
behind with 114,333 such articles.250 A recent study also points to a
large “diffusion deficit” between the United States and China in AI,
with China struggling to adopt AI innovations at scale in academia
and industry.251

China Engages on AI Safety Talks but Shuns Military
AI Policy

Beijing  has  taken  limited  steps  to  engage  with  the  United
States  on  the  issue  of  global  AI  risks  and  safety.  In  November
2023,  Beijing  attended  the  UK  AI  Safety  Summit  and  agreed  to
share  a  common  approach  to  identifying  and  mitigating AI  risks
with  the  EU,  the  United  States,  and  26  other  countries.252  The
same  month,  President  Joe  Biden  and  General  Secretary  Xi  met
and  agreed  to  hold  talks  regarding  the  risks  of  advanced AI  sys-
tems  and  efforts  to  improve AI  safety.253  In  March  2024,  Beijing
supported a U.S.-led, nonbinding UN resolution on the protection
of  data  and  monitoring  of  AI  risks.254  Chinese  and  U.S.  officials
also  met  behind  closed  doors  in  Geneva  in  May  2024  to  discuss
how each side views AI risks and safety.255

Despite  its  surface-level  engagement  in AI  safety  talks,  China
has  shown  little  willingness  to  make  firm  commitments  on  lim-
iting  the  military  applications  of  AI.  In  December  2021,  China
submitted  a  position  paper  to  the  UN  calling  on  all  countries  to
refrain  from  using  AI  to  “seek  absolute  military  advantage”  or
“pursue  hegemony,”  but  it  did  not  rule  out  its  use  for “legitimate

national  defense  capabilities.” 256  This  caveat  regarding  the  use
of  AI  for  “legitimate  national  defense  capabilities”  could  suggest
Beijing  envisions  using  AI-enabled  weapons  and  processes  in
military  operations  to  defend  what  it  regards  as  its  “core  inter-
ests,”  including  the  forcible  unification  of  Taiwan.257  China  did
not support a U.S.-led declaration on the responsible military use
of AI during November 2023.258 Chinese officials did not publicly
respond to a statement made by Principal Deputy Assistant Sec-
retary  of  State  Paul  Dean  in  May  2024  that  the  United  States
welcomed  a  clear  and  strong  commitment  from  both  China  and
Russia to ensure that only humans, not AI, would control nuclear
weapons.259

China Pursues AI for Military Applications

AI  will  serve  as  a  core  part  of  China’s  future  military  strategy,
underpinning the PLA’s efforts to exploit vulnerabilities in the tech-
nology  systems  the  United  States  deploys  on  the  battlefield  and  to
make  operational  decisions  more  quickly  than  U.S.  warfighters.260
(For  more  on  the  PLA’s  approach  to  informationized  warfare,  see
Chapter 8, “China’s Evolving Counter-Intervention Capabilities and
the  Role  of  Indo-Pacific  Allies.”)  Procurement  records  and  writings
by  Chinese  military  experts  in  recent  years  suggest  the  People’s
Liberation  Army  (PLA)  is  already  procuring  AI  systems  for  inte-
gration  into  its  weapons  platforms  and  capabilities.261  One  report
by  CSET  comparing  U.S.  and  Chinese  military  procurement  of  AI
systems  found  that  both  militaries  are  focusing  on  similar  applica-
tions,  with  most  contracts  being  awarded  for  autonomous  vehicles
and  intelligence,  surveillance,  and  reconnaissance  (ISR).262  Of  the
almost  2,000  military  contracts  awarded  by  the  PLA  between April
and  November  2020,  119  contracts  appeared  to  be  directly  related
to AI, the majority of which were related to AI-enabled autonomous
vehicles  (38  percent),  followed  by  ISR  systems  (17  percent),  predic-
tive  maintenance  and  logistics  systems  (16  percent),  information
and  electronic  warfare  (7  percent),  simulation  and  training  (4  per-
cent),  automatic  target  recognition  (4  percent),  and  command  and
control (4 percent).* 263 This analysis reflects only a dated snapshot
of  unclassified  procurement  and  precedes  the  significant  increase
in  awareness  around AI  since  the  public  release  of  ChatGPT—so  it
should  be  treated  accordingly.264  In  any  event,  it  is  clear  China  is
actively pursuing AI for military applications to enhance its capabil-
ities,  complement  its  current  approach  to  informationized  warfare,
and  facilitate  the  PLA’s  longstanding  efforts  to  leapfrog  the  United
States militarily and shift the global balance of power.265

* CSET  categorized  the  remaining  10  percent  of  contracts  as “other.”  Margarita  Konaev  et  al.,

April and November 2020,” Center for Security and Emerging Technology, August 2023, 8.

AI as the Eyes and Ears of the PLA

AI-enabled  ISR  systems  appear  to  be  a  priority  for  the  PLA.266
The  PLA  sees  value  in  leveraging  AI  capabilities  for  ISR  to  help
speed up the processing of imagery, signals, and other kinds of intel-
ligence across the land, air, sea, and space domains.267 PLA experts
have  recognized  that  ISR  improved  by  AI  can  be  useful  in  detect-
ing  the  movements  of  an  adversary’s  conventional  military  assets
as well as tracking its submarine and land-based nuclear forces.268
China’s  incorporation  of  effective  AI  into  its  ISR  capabilities  could
allow the PLA to rapidly locate U.S. military forces during a conflict
over Taiwan or the South China Sea and help it combine joint forces
across domains to launch precision strikes.269

According to the CSET report, most of the PLA’s known contracts
for AI-enabled  ISR  are  awarded  by  the  PLA  Navy,  and  many  focus
on geospatial imagery tasks such as equipping satellites with image
collection,  polarized  surface  detection,  and  multi-source  data  fusion
tools  powered  by  machine  learning.270  A  December  2023  article  in
Chinese  state  media  provided  one  example  of  a  platform  that  may
integrate AI into ISR, noting that the Aviation Industry Corporation
of China planned to incorporate AI into the Wing Loong unmanned
aerial  vehicle  platform  to  improve  the  drone’s  ability  to  perform
tasks  like  topographic  mapping,  among  other  things.271  Other  PLA
contracts  appear  to  focus  on  incorporating  AI  into  air  defense.  For
example, the Hebei Xintu Technology Company was awarded a con-
tract  by  the  PLA  for  a  “drone  aircraft  detector”  to  be  used  in  air
defense.272

AI in Battlefield Decision-Making

Beijing  is  researching  how AI  can  be  utilized  in  decision-making
to enhance wargaming and command and control. At least based on
the relatively small percentage of procurements reflected in CSET’s
data snapshot, the PLA does not appear to be prioritizing these uses
as  much  as  other  applications.* 273  Chinese  experts  note  that  AI
can  shorten  the  “observe-orient-decide-act” †  loop,  raise  situational
awareness,  and  assist  PLA  commanders  in  formulating  judgments,
planning  missions,  and  controlling  operations  within  increasingly
complex warfare environments.274 These include:

 • Reluctance  to  cede  political  control  over  military  decision-mak-
ing:  The  Central  Military  Commission  exercises  the  Party’s
political  control  over  all  military  affairs  and  has  historically
maintained  a  tight  grip  on  the  use  of  the  PLA’s  strategic  as-

* As  noted,  this  was  a  limited  study,  based  on  a  2020  subset  of  119  PLA  contracts  for  AI
systems. The  study  found  that  only  4  percent  of  these  contracts  were  related  to  battlefield  deci-
sion-making systems and that China awarded just five contracts for command and control appli-
cation  systems  between April  and  November  2020.  It  is  not  clear  if  the  short “snapshot”  reflects
overall PLA priorities and spending patterns. Margarita Konaev et al., “U.S. and Chinese Military
AI Purchases: An Assessment of Military Procurement Data between April and November 2020,”

gence,” Center for Security and Emerging Technology, October 2021, 24–26.

† The  observe-orient-decide-act  (OODA)  loop  is  a  decision-making  concept  developed  by  U.S.
Air Force Colonel John Boyd. The concept is designed to provide a disciplined means of thinking
about events that are unfolding before military decision-makers. The concept is intended to help
the military gain a decisive advantage in the decision-making process by dealing with situations
in  a  more  expedited  fashion.  Kimberly  Wright,  “OODA  Loop  Makes  Its  Mark  on  Maxwell,”  Air

sets,  such  as  nuclear  weapons  and  cyber  capabilities.275  While
advances in AI will give Chinese leaders new technologies to as-
sist  decision-making,  Chinese  officials  may  be  reticent  to  defer
to AI-generated recommendations for military decision-making.
Yang  Zi,  a  PhD  candidate  at  the  S.  Rajaratnam  School  of  In-
ternational  Studies,  argues  that  Xi’s  personal  preferences  are
still  likely  to  overshadow  AI-generated  recommendations  and
that such a dynamic could handicap the PLA’s AI-enabled deci-
sion-making  in  a  crisis  scenario.276  Tong  Zhao,  a  senior  fellow
in the nuclear policy program at Carnegie China, has observed
that  China’s  policy  community  also  supports  keeping  humans
“in  the  loop”  and  limiting  the  use  of AI  in  nuclear  weapon  sys-
tems for safety reasons.277

 • Concerns  that  limited  data  training  and  visibility  into  AI  al-
gorithms  could  distort  military  decision-making:  One  challenge
for the PLA going forward will be training AI algorithms to ac-
count for complex battlefield scenarios, in part because the PLA
lacks  data  from  real  wars.278  Without  adequate  data  based  on
actual  combat  scenarios  gained  while  fighting  an  adversary, AI
models could potentially provide false assessments or erroneous
recommendations  to  military  officials.279  In  order  to  maximize
performance,  the  PLA  will  also  need  to  train  its AI  algorithms
to  analyze  variables  in  realistic  natural  environments,  such  as
the  weather  or  atmospheric  conditions,  and  in  artificial  envi-
ronments,  like  defensive  networks  or  battle  lines.280  The  PLA
likely recognizes the problems associated with this data deficit,
but it is unclear  what steps it is taking  to  rectify  it.  For exam-
ple,  it  is  not  clear  if  China  and  Russia  are  using  Russia’s  war
of aggression in Ukraine as a data source.

 • Concerns  that  AI-enabled  decision-making  could  exacerbate
risks  in  conflict  with  the  United  States:  Experts  from  both  the
United  States  and  China  have  recognized  that  the  integration
of  AI  into  military  decision-making  systems  could  accelerate  a
crisis by facilitating hasty decision-making.281 Furthermore, ex-
perts from both countries have assessed that the adversary may
deliberately “poison” the data used by the other side, which may
degrade the performance and judgments of their AI systems.282
These concerns may make Chinese leaders more reticent to rely
on AI to make high-stakes military judgments.

AI to Enhance Combat Performance and Lethality

The  PLA  is  exploring  the  use  of  AI  to  enable  autonomous  sys-
tems for battlefield support and to increase the lethality of military
units  by  carrying  out  warfighting  tasks  traditionally  conducted  by
humans.283  China  is  researching  and  developing  AI  technologies
that  seek  to  enhance  the  target  recognition  and  coordination  of
lethal  autonomous  weapons,  which  are  weapons  systems  that  use
sensor  suites  and  computer  algorithms  to  identify  targets  and  sub-
sequently  engage  and  destroy  the  target  without  manual  human
control.284 Lethal autonomous weapons systems are not yet in wide-
spread  development,  but  they  could  someday  enable  military  oper-
ations  in  communications-degraded  or  -denied  environments  where
traditional  systems  may  not  be  able  to  operate.285  Platforms  that

203

are  classified  as  lethal  autonomous  weapons  systems  include  mis-
sile defense systems, sentry systems, and loitering munitions.286 AI
systems  performing  automatic  target  recognition  made  up  only  4
percent  of  PLA  contracts  in  the  limited  CSET  snapshot  of  public
contracts  examined,  but  there  are  early  signs  that  Chinese  defense
manufacturers  are  designing  systems  that  could  someday  actualize
the  lethal  autonomous  weapons  concept.* 287  For  example,  one  Chi-
nese  manufacturer  of  intelligent  unmanned  aerial  systems  known
as Zhuhai Ziyan UAS has produced the Blowfish A2, an unmanned
helicopter  equipped  with  guns,  bombs,  radar  technology,  and  jam-
ming  devices.288  The  Blowfish  A2  reportedly  uses  an  AI  module  to

AI in Disinformation and Cognitive Warfare Operations

A  major  area  of  U.S.-China  competition  within  AI  is  large  lan-
guage  models,  or  LLMs,†  which  China  could  deploy  against  the
United  States  in  cognitive  warfare  operations.‡ 290  China  has  en-
gaged  in  online  influence  operations  against  the  United  States  for
years  and  appeared  to  escalate  large-scale  online  influence  opera-
tions  on  U.S.-based  social  media  platforms  since  2019,  when  Meta
and  X  (formerly  known  as  Twitter)  first  attributed  inauthentic  ac-
counts  originating  from  China.§ 291  Nathan  Beauchamp-Mustafaga,
a senior policy researcher at the RAND Corporation, testified before
the Commission that AI could significantly enhance China’s existing
cyber-enabled  influence  operations.292  Mr.  Beauchamp-Mustafaga
argued  that  generative  AI  could  dramatically  improve  the  authen-
ticity, cost effectiveness, and scale of state-sponsored influence oper-

* An  automatic  target  recognition  system  is  not  necessarily  a  lethal  autonomous  weapon  sys-
tem,  as  human  intervention  could  still  be  a  necessary  step  in  the  decision  to  use  lethal  force
against the recognized target.

† LLMs  are  mathematical  representations  of  patterns  found  in  natural  language  that  can  cre-
ate text, answer questions, and hold conversations by making inferences about subsequent words
in  sentences.  LLMs  power  generative  AI  tools  such  as  OpenAI’s  ChatGPT  and  Google’s  Bard.
Generative AI  refers  to  algorithms  that  can  be  used  to  create  new  content,  including  audio,  im-
ages,  text, simulations, and  videos.  McKinsey  and  Company, “What Is Generative AI?” McKinsey

‡ Cognitive  warfare  consists  of  influencing  international  public  opinion,  shocking  and  demor-
alizing  enemy  soldiers  and  citizens  through  psychological  operations,  and  conducting  influence
campaigns  to  shape  international  law  in  Beijing’s  favor.  LLMs  and  text-to-image  models  are
also well suited to social media manipulation due to their ability to produce convincing text and
images—with  little  effort  by  the  user—that  can  then  be  disseminated  online.  William  Marcel-

§ For  example,  in  March  2020,  China-linked  accounts  disseminated  false  warnings  about  a
nationwide  COVID-19  lockdown  to  allegedly  incite  public  panic  within  the  United  States  and
decrease  trust  with  the  U.S.  government.  A  September  2023  report  by  the  U.S.  Department  of
State’s Global Engagement Center noted that aside from narratives on COVID-19, China has also
carried out disinformation campaigns about the AUKUS partnership as well as echoing Russia’s
false  accusations  that  the  United  States  is  escalating  the  war  in  Ukraine.  U.S.  Department  of

ations  by  malign  actors  while  reducing  human  labor  requirements
and the probability of detection.293

Similarly, reporting by Microsoft has established that an actor af-
filiated with China’s domestic security services has used AI to spread
disinformation  in  democracies  such  as  the  United  States  and  Tai-
wan.294 In April 2024, Microsoft reported that the CCP-linked actor
Storm-1376  (also  known  as  “Dragonbridge”  or  “Spamouflage”)  has
used AI-generated content to conduct influence operations spanning
175  websites  and  58  languages.295  Storm-1376  was  reportedly  re-
sponsible  for  spreading  conspiratorial  narratives  on  multiple  social
media platforms, alleging that the U.S. government had deliberately
initiated  the  wildfires  on  the  northwest  coast  of  Maui,  Hawaii.296
Storm-1376  also  targeted  Taiwan’s  2024  presidential  and  legisla-
tive  elections,  attempting  to  undermine  the  legitimacy  of  multiple
candidates, including now president William Lai, in what Microsoft
claimed  was  the  first  time AI  had  been  used  to  influence  a  foreign
election.* 297 (For more information on China’s attempts to influence
Taiwan’s elections, see Chapter 9, “Taiwan.”)

In  their  writings,  PLA  researchers  have  shown  interest  in  using
generative AI for future cognitive warfare operations.298 In 2020, for
example, two PLA researchers argued in the China Military Science
journal  that  deepfakes  using  AI  are  cheap  and  easy  to  create  and
require less time than other methods, asserting that improvements
in  machine  learning  will  lead  to  their  prevalence.299  There  is  also
evidence that PLA-affiliated researchers at Base 311, a Chinese mil-
itary  unit  headquartered  in  Fuzhou  Province  that  conducts  cogni-
tive warfare, have explored how the Chinese military can use AI to
automatically generate authentic-looking content.300

China Developing Humanoid and Quadruped Robots
One  of  the  areas  AI  is  helping  revolutionize  is  robotics.  AI  is
helping  accelerate  the  development  of  humanoid  and  quadruped
robots,  both  in  their  ability  to  respond  to  human  commands  and
in  their  capacity  for  fine  and  gross  movement  for  expanded  ver-
satility.301  For  instance,  China’s  state  media  has  said  that  the
application  of  LLMs  can  make  humanoid  robots  more  capable  of
possessing  decision-making  capabilities,  although  the  connection
between  the  robot’s  “brain”  and  its  “limbs”  is  still  awaiting  new
technological breakthroughs.302 China’s MIIT announced in Octo-
ber  2023  that  the  country  would  establish  a  world-class  human-
oid robot innovation system by 2025 and deploy humanoid robots
in “real  economy”  industries  such  as  manufacturing,  build  an  in-

* In December 2023, Storm-1376 also promoted a series of AI-generated memes of Taiwan’s then
Democratic Progressive Party candidate William Lai with a countdown theme noting “X days” to
take the Democratic Progressive Party out of power, as well as an AI-generated video of a woman
claiming to “reveal” Mr. Lai’s mistresses and illegitimate children and an AI-generated audio file
claiming Mr. Lai was an informant in the 1980s. On election day in January, Storm-1376 posted
suspected  AI-generated  audio  clips  of  Foxconn  owner  Terry  Gou,  an  independent  candidate  in
the presidential race. The audio manipulated Mr. Gou’s voice to make it sound as though he was
endorsing  another  candidate  in  the  presidential  race,  even  though  he  never  formally  endorsed
any  presidential  candidate  in  the  race.  During  the  same  month,  Storm-1376  also  created  and
amplified a defamatory video series about then President Tsai Ing-wen using AI-generated news
anchors and ByteDance’s CapCut video editing app. Microsoft Threat Intelligence, “Same Targets,

China Developing Humanoid and Quadruped Robots—
Continued
ternationally competitive industrial industry, and expand the use
of humanoid robots throughout society by 2027.303

The realistic timing for the wide-scale availability of fully func-
tional humanoid and quadruped robots within China is not clear.
Humanoid robot firms globally face technical obstacles, including
the  limited  storage  capacity  of  batteries  that  power  the  robots
and  the  current  technical  limitations  of  components  like  actu-
ators  that  allow  the  robot  to  move  itself  and  manipulate  other
objects.304  Far  more  progress  is  needed  before  humanoid  robots
will  be  able  to  reason  through  an  unexpected  situation  and  then
act  on  it.305  While  China’s  capacity  to  achieve  its  goals  in  the
stated  time  frames  may  be  doubtful,  if  their  overall  efforts  are
successful,  humanoid  robots  could  have  transformative  impli-
cations  across  commercial  industries,  including  manufacturing,
agriculture,  and  healthcare  and  potentially  for  military  and  law
enforcement as well.306

When sufficiently advanced, these rapidly developing humanoid
robot  technologies  have  serious  implications  for  China’s  military
capabilities. China’s policy of military-civil fusion, which leverages
commercial technologies for the advancement of China’s military,
blurs  the  boundaries  of  what  would  constitute  a  commercial  or
military product.307 Chinese military analysts have put forth new
theories  of  human-robot  cooperation  if  the  technology  advances,
such  as  replacing  front-line  soldiers  with  humanoid  robots  while
humans  maintain  control  of  command  and  decision-making.308
Chinese  state  media  outlets  claim  that  humanoid  robots  will
change the organization and use of combat forces, since they can
theoretically  be  mixed  with  humans  and  grouped  separately  ac-
cording to combat missions and objectives; they can also be used
for  logistical  support  such  as  carrying  equipment,  for  heavy  con-
struction tasks, or for planting and removing mines.* 309

One  example  of  military  applications  emerged  in  May  2024
during  China’s  Golden  Dragon-2024  joint  military  exercise  with
Cambodia, when the PLA unveiled a modified version of a quad-
ruped  robot  “dog,”  the  B1,  made  by  Chinese  robot  maker  Uni-
tree.† 310  Equipped  with  a  mounted  assault  rifle  on  its  back,
the  quadruped  can  jump  as  well  as  follow  and  lead  an  infantry
team.311 One PLA soldier told Chinese state media that the quad-
ruped  robot  could  engage  a  target  upon  discovery,  asserting  that
the  technology  will  serve  as  a “new  team  member  for  our  urban

* Former PLA officer and military commentator Fu Qianshao wrote in an online commentary in
April 2024 that humanoid robots could aid the PLA in an invasion of Taiwan by replacing actual
troops  on  the  battlefield,  which  would  reduce  the  risk  of  human  casualties.  Fu  Qianshao,  “The
Rise of China’s Humanoid Robot Industry Will Replace the People’s Liberation Army in Perform-
ing Tasks, Making the Reunification Easier,” (中国人形机器人产业崛起，代替解放军执行任务，让统

† According  to  Unitree’s  company  website,  a  commercial  version  of  the  B1,  which  can  be  used
for  inspecting  power  plants,  is  equipped  with AI  capabilities  that  enable  it  to  avoid  collisions  in
real time, control switches, press buttons, and carry out other tasks. Unitree, “Recognition Devices

attack  and  defense  operations.” 312  Unitree  has  claimed  that  it
does  not  sell  its  products  to  the  PLA,  but  the  use  of  its  product
in a formal military exercise underscores the ease with which the
PLA can potentially acquire products from civilian companies.313
In the future, China’s demographic decline could lead to human-
oid  robots  as  replacements  for  an  aging,  shrinking  workforce.314
In the present, Chinese researchers are also exploring the use of
humanoid robots for economic and commercial purposes. Human-
oid robots in China are undergoing limited deployment in various
sectors but are primarily being used for research, and reports in-
dicate humanoid robot firms are not generating commercial sales
yet.315  However,  rapidly  declining  costs  of  producing  humanoid
robots  could  allow  for  more  widespread  adoption.316  A  Goldman
Sachs  report  from  February  2024  estimates  that  the  humanoid
robot  market  could  reach  $38  billion  by  2035,  with  1.4  million
units  shipped,  primarily  for  industrial  settings.317  The  Goldman
Sachs report also notes that the viability of “mass-produced, gen-
eral-purpose humanoid robots . . . hasn’t been proven yet.” 318

Quantum  Information  Science:  The  Next  Frontier  of  U.S.-

China Technology Competition

Quantum  information  science  (QIS) *  may  eventually  become  a
paradigm-shifting  technology  enabling  computation  and  sensing  at
a  speed  and  scale  heretofore  impossible.  Quantum  technology  will
enable a significant performance boost in processing that will poten-
tially  help  solve  complex  problems  more  efficiently.  Advancements
in quantum technology could potentially revolutionize global supply
chains  by  refining  production  processes,  streamlining  logistics,  and
optimizing  resource  allocation.319  QIS  also  has  significant  military
and national security implications. QIS can enable a state to decrypt
an  adversary’s  communications,  improve  the  ability  to  locate  and
track  an  adversary’s  military  assets,  and  process  battlefield  data
faster than an opponent.320 Arthur Herman, a senior fellow and di-
rector  of  the  Quantum  Alliance  Initiative  at  the  Hudson  Institute,
asserts  that “the  nation  that  enjoys  quantum  supremacy,  will  dom-
inate  the  future  of  the  global  system,”  as  the  technology  will  offer
significant advantages for business and national security.321

QIS  can  be  grouped  into  three  primary  categories,  each  of  which
can  be  used  for  military  and  civilian-commercial  applications:  com-
munications,  sensing,  and  computing.322  Quantum  communications
uses qubits, or photons of light that transmit data along optical ca-
bles,  making  communications  extremely  secure  against  eavesdrop-
ping and interception.323

* According  to  the  Pacific  Northwest  National  Laboratory,  QIS  seeks  to  understand  how  infor-
mation is processed and transmitted using quantum principles, merging quantum mechanics, and
information/computation  theory.  Quantum  computers  process  information  in  the  form  of  qubits,
which  may  occupy  intermediate  values  rather  than  using  bits  with  a  1  or  0  value  (like  classi-
cal  computers).  Qubits  operate  cooperatively  through  quantum  entanglement,  which  multiply
interactions over billions of switches to create a powerful computer that can tackle computation-
al  challenges  that  classical  computers  cannot.  Pacific  Northwest  National  Laboratory,  “What  Is
Quantum Information Science?”

207

Quantum  sensing  technologies  analyze  data  at  the  atomic  level,
making them significantly more sensitive and accurate compared to
conventional  sensors.324  In  military  applications,  quantum  sensing
is  used  to  help  enhance  imaging,  radar,  sub-surface  sensing,  and
navigation capabilities (including in GPS-denied environments).325
Lastly, where a classical computer can solve a problem with mul-
tiple variables along a single path, quantum computers can explore
multiple paths in parallel to scale their operations exponentially.326
Quantum  computing  could  enable  countries  to  break  through  en-
cryption  methods  used  by  adversarial  governments  and  militaries,
improve  military  logistics,  enhance  modeling  and  simulation,  and
rapidly increase the pace of scientific research.327

Experts differ on the likely timeframe over which the potential of
QIS can be realized, and it varies across the three categories. While
the field of quantum mechanics has been studied for over a century,
applications  in  advanced  technologies  have  entered  or  approached
practical development only in recent years.* 328 Some experts assert
that  we  are  on  the  cusp  of  a  new  revolution  in  quantum  technolo-
gy, as experimental concepts are being actualized into technological
breakthroughs.329  The  U.S.  Defense  Science  Board  has  estimated
that  quantum  sensing  technology,  which  is  generally  considered  by
experts to be the closest to useful deployment, will have “operational
utility”  in  the  2024  to  2029  timeframe.330  In  a  response  to  a  ques-
tion for the record before the Commission, Edward Parker, physical
scientist with the RAND Corporation, agreed with this assessment,
stating  that  broadly  speaking,  quantum  sensing  is  the  most  tech-
nically  mature  of  the  three  subfields  of  QIS.331  Dr.  Parker  noted
that  within  quantum  computing,  technical  approaches  based  on
superconducting,  trapped-ion,  or  neutral-atom  qubits  are  more  ad-
vanced than quantum computers based on photonic, silicon-spin, or
topological qubits.332 Furthermore, Dr. Parker stated that the high-
est-impact  applications  of  quantum  computing,  such  as  decryption,
are  unlikely  to  arrive  prior  to  2030.333  Boston  Consulting  Group
reports that between 2025 and 2030, new quantum communications
technologies  will  be  adopted  by  private  companies,  and  a  growing
number  of  quantum  random  number  generator  chips  will  become
more prevalent in Internet of Things (IoT) infrastructure, while new
quantum communications repeaters, memories, and error-correction
algorithms will be adopted from 2030 onward.334

Because  of  its  potential  importance,  both  the  United  States  and
China are investing heavily into QIS and are the two leading coun-
tries  by  most  relevant  metrics.335  In  October  2020,  Xi  himself  em-
phasized  the  importance  of  quantum  technology,  telling  the  CCP’s
Central  Committee  that  the  development  of  quantum  science  and
technology  “is  of  great  scientific  significance  and  strategic  value”
and that it is a “major disruptive technological innovation.” 336 More
recently, in August 2024, the United States said that QIS “holds the
potential  to  drive  innovations  across  the  American  economy,  from

* Dr.  Parker  asserts  that  broadly  speaking,  the  field  of  quantum  technology  “is  still  very  na-
scent,”  with  atomic  clocks  being  the  only  quantum  technology  publicly  known  to  be  deployed  by
any  nation’s  military.  Edward  Parker,  written  testimony  for  U.S.-China  Economic  and  Security
Review Commission, Hearing on Current and Emerging Technologies in U.S.-China Economic and

fields as diverse as materials science and pharmaceuticals to finance
and energy.” 337

The United States and China are competing heavily to outpace
each  other  in  QIS  research.338  China’s  quantum  R&D  is  largely
carried  out  in  Hefei,  Anhui  Province,  at  state-funded  laborato-
ries,  with  additional  support  from  several  startups.339  The  He-
fei  National  Laboratory  for  Physical  Sciences  at  the  Microscale
(HFNL), affiliated  with the University of Science and Technology
of China, received $1.06 billion in laboratory funding in 2017, ac-
cording to Chinese media reporting, with an additional (although
not  confirmed)  funding  package  of  $2.95  billion  per  year  planned
between  2017  and  2022.340  Assuming  this  funding  was  provid-
ed  as  described,  the  figure  for  this  single  laboratory  far  exceeds
the  estimated  annual  R&D  spending  on  quantum  research  for
the  entire  country,  listed  in  the  13th  Five-Year  Plan  (2016–2020)
at  approximately  $84  million,  illustrating  its  importance  as  the
center  for  China’s  development  of  quantum  technologies.341  In
addition to this state laboratory, Hefei is also home to three of the
eight major quantum startups in China, including Ciqtek, Origin
Quantum,  and  QuantumCtek.* 342  Outside  of  Hefei,  other  major
quantum  startups  include  Kunfeng,  Qasky,  QuDoor,  Shenzhou
Quantum  Communication  Technology,  and  SpinQ.343  Although
other  large  Chinese  technology  companies—including  Alibaba,
Baidu,  Huawei,  Tencent,  and  ZTE—had  invested  in  quantum
technology  R&D,  Dr.  Parker  notes  they  appear  to  have  reduced
their investment in the field, with both Baidu and Alibaba closing
their  quantum  research  labs  since  November  2023.† 344

The U.S. government is a primary funder of open QIS research
domestically,  growing  significantly  every  year  since  the  2018  Na-
tional  Quantum  Initiative.‡ 345 The  National  Quantum  Initiative
Act  authorized  eight  initiatives  in  QIS  for  sustained  multiyear

* Dr.  Parker  et  al.  assert  that  the  largest  difference  between  Chinese  startups  and  their  U.S.
counterparts  is  that  the  Chinese  companies  have  announced  far  less  capital  funding,  with  only
$44 million in publicly identified capital for Chinese quantum startups compared to $1.28 billion
for U.S. startups. Edward Parker et al., “An Assessment of the U.S. and Chinese Industrial Bases
in Quantum Technology,” RAND Corporation, February 2, 2022, 84.

† According  to  Dr.  Parker,  several  of  the  large  Chinese  companies,  such  as  Baidu  and Ten-
cent, had shut down their quantum computing efforts. He noted that Baidu announced it was
selling all of its quantum computing hardware to a national lab, assessing that the concentra-
tion to national labs appeared to be consolidating even more in the six months prior to Febru-
ary 2024. Although Dr. Parker said he did not have great visibility into why Baidu made this
decision,  he  speculated  that  the  company  assessed  it  would  not  be  technically  competitive  in
this field, as they were “far behind U.S. companies, did not seem to be catching up, and did not
see it as a revenue generator.” Dr. Parker argues that when discussing China as a whole, the
country appeared to be doubling down on national laboratories, as none of the Chinese quan-
tum  technology  companies  seemed  to  be  globally  competitive.  In  Baidu’s  2023  annual  report
to  the  U.S.  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission,  the  company  acknowledges  the  impact  of
the  Biden  Administration’s  August  2023  executive  order  directing  the  Treasury  Department
to  create  an  outbound  foreign  direct  investment  review  program  that  will  require  reporting
on (or in more narrow circumstances prohibit) investments by U.S. persons involving “covered
national security technologies and products,” including quantum information technologies, as
well  as  the  Treasury  Department’s  Advanced  Notice  of  Proposed  Rulemaking.  Baidu  claims
that  “uncertainties  on  whether  the  outbound  foreign  direct  investment  review  program  will
have  a  material  impact  on  our  business,  results  of  operations,  financial  condition,  and  pros-
pects.” U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Form 20-F, March 15, 2024. 45–46; Edward

funding,  such  as  the  National  Science  Foundation-led  Institute
for Hybrid Quantum Architectures and Networks and the Depart-
ment  of  Energy’s  Co-design  Center  for  Quantum  Advantage.346
The  U.S.  government  provided  actual  budget  expenditures  for
QIS  R&D  of  $449  million  in  fiscal  year  (FY)  2019,  $672  million
in  FY  2020,  $855  million  in  FY  2021,  and  $1.03  billion  in  FY
2022,  followed  by  $932  million  of  enacted  budget  authority  for
FY 2023 and a requested budget authority of $968 million for FY
2024.347  Some  of  these  expenditures  have  resulted  in  additional
government  support  at  the  state  level.  For  example,  the  U.S.  De-
partment  of  Commerce’s  Economic  Development  Administration
announced  $41  million  in  funding  on  July  2,  2024,  for  Elevate
Quantum  (“Elevate”),  a  private-public  consortium  seeking  to  ad-
vance  quantum  research  in  the  Mountain  West,  which  unlocked
$77  million  in  funding  for  Elevate  from  Colorado  and  $10  mil-
lion  from  New  Mexico.348  The  United  States  also  has  a  strong
private  industry  in  QIS  with  at  least  182  firms,  a  majority  of
which  (139  companies)  are  part  of  Quantum  Economic  Develop-
ment Consortium (QED-C), established by the National Quantum
Initiative.349  As  of  2021,  55  of  these  QED-C  companies  focus  on
computing, 20 focus on sensing, 12 focus on communications, and
40  deal  with  cross-cutting  sectors  of  QIS.350  The  venture  capital
(VC)  industry  has  been  a  significant  source  of  funding  for  quan-
tum  in  the  United  States,  with  sources  indicating  over  $2.5  bil-
lion  invested  through  2022,  though  perhaps  echoing  the  private
sector investment decline in China, 2023 saw a significant decline
of 80 percent in VC funding for quantum computing in the United
States.351

Overall,  Dr.  Parker  assesses  that  China’s  progress  across  the
three  main  subdomains  of  QIS  has  made  the  country  “impres-
sively fast followers across many quantum technology areas” and
that  some  experts  regard  China  as  the  world  leader  in  quantum
communications.352  A  2022  research  report  by  Dr.  Parker  et  al.
comparing the quantum industrial bases of China and the United
States found that the United States is the overall top producer of
high-impact *  scientific  publications  in  QIS,  most  notably  in  the
fields  of  quantum  computing  and  sensing.353  By  contrast,  China
leads  in  high-impact  quantum  communications  research.354  In
terms  of  institutional  research  capacity,  as  of  2020,  China  actu-
ally  had  a  greater  number  of  institutions  working  on  quantum
research  across  the  three  primary  subdomains  of  QIS  than  did

However, these U.S. and Chinese leads in particular quantum ar-

eas may change, given the long timelines for implementation.

Below is a brief discussion of some areas of apparent progress in
China on QIS. There may be a basis for skepticism regarding some
of  the  claimed  breakthroughs  announced  by  Chinese  researchers;
when  these  have  been  questioned  by  U.S.  scientists  and  experts,  it
is noted.356

 • Potential progress in computing: Recent developments illus-
trate  China’s  potential  progress  in  quantum  computing  capa-
bilities.
 ○ In September 2024, the South China Morning Post (SCMP)
reported  that  Chinese  scientists  at  Shanghai  University
had  demonstrated  the  first  effective  attack  using  a  quan-
tum  computer  on  the  class  of  algorithms  used  in  pass-
word-protection  and  encryption  mechanisms  common  in
military  and  financial  networks.357 The  researchers  used  a
quantum computer produced by Canadian company D-Wave
Systems.358  According  to  the  authors,  this  study  did  not
produce  a  passcode  for  the  best  available  military-grade
encryption  like  Advanced  Encryption  Standard  (AES-256),
but such a breakthrough may be closer than ever before.359
The  authors  of  the  study  did  note  that  underdeveloped
hardware  and  the  incapability  of  a  single  attack  algorithm
to  target  multiple  cryptographic  systems  presented  practi-
cal  constraints.360

 ○ Quantum  experts  agree  that  the  study  indicates  “incremen-
tal  advances  in  quantum  computing”  but  also  note  that  the
SCMP article was misleading, as the study itself applied only
to  RSA  encryption,§  not  military-grade  AES  (Advanced  En-

cryptographic systems obsolete.361

 ○ In  January  2023,  a  group  of  Chinese  scientists  claimed  they
used  a  combination  of  classical  and  quantum  computing
techniques  to  breach  the  RSA  encryption  algorithm  used  in
military,  banking,  and  communications  systems.362  Notably,
the  paper  summarizing  their  findings  asserts  that  the  RSA
algorithm  could  be  broken  with  a  quantum  machine  using
only 372 qubits (which is less than IBM’s world-class Osprey,
operating  with  433  qubits),  potentially  illustrating  the  effi-
ciency  of  the  Chinese  quantum  computer  if  the  findings  are
true.363  However,  quantum  researchers  and  scientists  have
offered  mixed  reviews  of  the  paper,  with  Massachusetts  In-
stitute  of  Technology  (MIT)  scientist  Peter  Shor  stating,  “As
far  as  I  can  tell,  the  paper  isn’t  wrong”  but  that  the  Chinese
researchers  failed  to  demonstrate  the  speed  with  which  the
quantum  algorithm  would  run,  leaving  questions  regarding
the  degree  of  improvement.364  At  the  time  of  the  announce-
ment, the SCMP noted that the paper had not been officially
peer  reviewed,  and  Scott Aaronson,  director  of  the  Quantum
Information Center at the University of Texas at Austin, said
the article was “one of the most actively misleading quantum
computing papers I’ve seen in 25 years.” 365

 ○ In  June  2024,  the  Anhui  Quantum  Computing  Engineering
Research  Center  and  QuantumCTek  (the  latter  of  which  is  a
quantum  company  currently  on  the  Commerce  Department’s
Entity List) * jointly announced that their quantum computer
dilution refrigerator is the first equipment of its kind commer-
cially  available  for  mass  production  in  China.† 366  According
to  an  article  published  by  the  Anhui  Daily,  the  dilution  re-
frigeration  products  were  delivered  to  two  scientific  research
units,  and  “after  many  months  of  testing  by  customers,  the
equipment  has  been  operating  continuously  and  stably  for  a
long  time.” 367  (For  more  on  the  importance  of  certain  refrig-
eration  technology  to  QIS,  see  “The  Global  Quantum  Supply
Chain and Relevant U.S. Export Controls” below.)

work”  for  quantum  computers.* 368  A  major  obstacle  to  the
module’s  domestic  production  in  China  has  been  sourcing  an
ultra-low-temperature  specialized  high-frequency  coaxial  ca-
ble,  which  was  previously  imported  from  Japan.369 This  new
device  can  allegedly  provide  microwave  signal  transmission
channels for quantum chips with more than 100 bits and can
achieve  stable  signal  transmission  across  temperature  zones
in  cool  environments.370  According  to  Kong  Weicheng,  a  re-
searcher at Origin Quantum, the module will allow quantum
chips  to  exert  “more  powerful  computational  capabilities,”
which enable quantum computers to operate efficiently.371
 • Potential  progress  in  sensing:  There  are  signs  of  progress
in  China’s  prototype  quantum  radars,  which  could  advance  the
PLA’s capability to detect foreign military assets.372 In 2018, for
example, the 14th Institute of the defense SOE China Electron-
ics Technology Group Corporation announced that its quantum
radar  technology  had  successfully  tested  detecting  targets  up
to  62  miles  away,  asserting  that  the  technology  is  expected  to
solve  bottleneck  issues  associated  with  traditional  radars,  such
as low-visibility target detection, survival under electronic war-
fare  conditions,  and  other  challenges.373  In  2021,  a  laboratory
at  Tsinghua  University  also  tested  a  quantum  radar  that  its
researchers claimed was capable of increasing the probability of
detecting stealth aircraft by generating a small electromagnetic
storm.374
 ○ However,  MIT  professor  Jeffrey  Shapiro,  one  of  the  technolo-
gy’s inventors, has previously argued that there are problems
with this approach that make it unfeasible.375

 • Potential progress in communications: China has sought to
create secure communications links through both ground-based
stations and satellites.376 Dr. Parker notes that Beijing may be
seeking  to  build  an  internal  communications  system  without
any  Western  technologies,  which  reflects  the  Chinese  leader-
ship’s  anxiety  about  vulnerability  to  foreign  espionage.377  Chi-
nese scientists have primarily focused their quantum communi-
cations  R&D  on  a  method  known  as  quantum  key  distribution
(QKD),  which  may  improve  communications  security  against
enemy  interception.378  In  2021,  China  successfully  tested  the
world’s first integrated QKD network, combining a satellite link
through  the  Mozi  (Micius)  satellite  that  connects  two  ground
stations approximately 1,616 miles apart (which achieved QKD
in  2016)  as  well  as  an  optical  fiber  network  stretching  around
1,243  miles  from  Beijing  to  Shanghai  (completed  in  2017),
providing  a  total  distance  of  roughly  2,858  miles  of  coverage
across  China.379  China  launched  its  second  QKD  satellite  in
July  2022—known  as  Jinan  1—for  additional  experimentation

* This  breakthrough  was  announced  shortly  after  BIS  added  Origin  Quantum  and  21  other
Chinese  quantum  organizations  to  its  Entity  List  for  “acquiring  [and/or]  attempting  to  acquire
U.S.-origin items in support of advancing China’s quantum technology capabilities.” It is too early
to assess the impact of BIS action on China’s continuing ability to make quantum advancements.

U.S. Response to Quantum National Security Risks

Unlike  the  broad,  country-based  controls  imposed  by  the  United
States in the advanced semiconductor space, until September 2024,
the U.S. policy response to QIS national security risks had been more
limited  perhaps  due  to  the  earlier  stage  of  the  technology  and  the
possibility that many QIS uses are not military. Until that time, the
United  States  had  primarily  taken  an  entity-based  approach  with
respect  to  QIS-related  export  controls  against  China.† 382  In  No-
vember  2021,  the  Commerce  Department’s  Bureau  of  Industry  and
Security  (BIS)  added  eight  Chinese  entities  to  the  Entity  List,  in-
cluding QuantumCTek, “to prevent U.S. emerging technologies from
being  used  for  the  PRC’s  quantum  computing  efforts  that  support
military  applications”  and  citing  potential  uses  in  counter-stealth
and  anti-submarine  applications  as  well  for  breaking  encryption
and developing unbreakable encryption.383 In May 2024, BIS added
another 22 Chinese institutes and firms to the Entity List, including
Origin Quantum, for aiding China’s quantum development.384

In September 2024, BIS issued a new interim final rule imposing
worldwide  export  controls  on  “quantum  computers,  related  equip-
ment,  components,  materials,  software,  and  technology  that  can
be  used  in  the  development  and  maintenance  of  quantum  comput-
ers.” 385  BIS  notes  that  the  controls  had  been  aligned  with  inter-
national  partners;  they  are  similar  to  those  put  in  place  this  year
by  the  UK,  France,  Spain,  the  Netherlands,  and  Canada,  which
some reporting suggests resulted from “Wassenaar minus 1” discus-
sions.386 The new BIS quantum controls also include provisions cre-
ating a licensing exception for countries that implement “equivalent
national controls,” thus incentivizing countries to adopt similar con-
trols to ease their access to U.S. technology and ability to engage in
cooperative research.387 Finally, the new controls include limited ex-
ceptions, so as not to disrupt ongoing R&D efforts across borders or
with foreign persons engaged in QIS research in the United States,
and annual reporting requirements to provide greater visibility into
the types of such activities.388

* According to the South China Morning Post, China launched Mozi, or Micius, the world’s first
quantum  communications  satellite,  in  2016.  A  team  of  Russian  scientists  began  working  with
the  Mozi  team  in  2020  to  help  them  set  up  systems  to  begin  conducting  experiments  with  the
satellite,  according  to  Alexey  Fedorov,  one  of  the  paper’s  coauthors.  Speaking  on  the  results  of
the experiment, the Russian scientists said the results help account for the imperfections of QKD
protocols,  such  as  the  problem  of  detector  efficient  mismatch,  which  they  say  are  “important  in
the context of their practical security.” The Russian scientists who wrote the paper are affiliated
with  six  different  Moscow-based  institutions,  including  the  Russian  Quantum  Center,  Moscow
Institute  of  Physics  and  Technology,  QSpace  Technologies,  HSE  University,  National  University
of  Science  and Technology  MISIS,  and  the  Steklov  Mathematical  Institute  of  the  Russian Acad-
emy  of  Sciences.  In  the  acknowledgements  section  of  the  paper,  the  Russian  authors  thanked
“our colleagues from the University of Science and Technology of China” for their assistance and
recommendations during the joint experiment. Victoria Bela, “China and Russia Test ‘Hack-Proof’

The Global Quantum Supply Chain and Relevant U.S. Export

Controls *

The  nature  of  the  QIS  supply  chains  have  made  a  U.S.  policy
response  more  challenging  than  the  more  concentrated  semicon-
ductor  supply  chain.389  Additionally,  some  argue  that  the  early
stage  of  the  technology  and  the  uncertainty  surrounding  which
QIS  applications  will  be  national  security-sensitive  necessitate
a  nuanced  approach  to  export  controls  to  ensure  they  do  not  in-
terfere  with  the  research  and  collaboration  needed  to  develop
the  technology.390  Dr.  Parker  argues  that  export  controls  should
primarily  be  applied  to  systems  with  operational  military  capa-
bilities instead of more broadly.391 Under a capability-focused ap-
proach,  U.S.  export  controls  would  only  target  specific  quantum
technology  when  it  becomes  capable  of  delivering  qualitatively
new capabilities like decryption.392 To illustrate this approach, in
his  February  2024  testimony  to  the  Commission,  Dr.  Parker  pro-
vided  the  example  of  “quantum  sensors”  as  a  category,  where  at
that point there were no general export controls on the technology
as  a  whole,  but  instead  there  were  export  controls  applicable  to
certain  highly  sensitive  sensors  (e.g.,  high-sensitivity  magnetom-
eters, gravimeters, and superconducting electromagnetic sensors)
that would cover certain quantum sensors if they are successfully
developed.393 Such an approach is different than the broad-based
approach  currently  taken  for  advanced  semiconductors,  which
seek  to  deny  China’s  access  to  a  key  foundational  technology  for
AI  given  the  inherent  risks,  rather  than  just  limiting  access  to
specific  military  applications.

A  more  broad-based  approach  to  export  controls  for  QIS  could
be  more  complicated  than  the  similar  approach  used  for  advanced
semiconductors  and  semiconductor  manufacturing  equipment  giv-
en  that  the  QIS  supply  chain  is  more  varied.  As  Dr.  Parker  notes,
“there are currently a wide variety of technical approaches [to QIS]
being  researched  in  parallel,  which  require  very  different  critical
components.” 394 A May 2024 report by Sam Howell, an associate fel-
low at CNAS, noted that the quantum computing sector has several
different  modalities  under  development  that  each  require  a  differ-
ent  and  evolving  set  of  inputs  with  very  little  overlap.395  Further,
the inputs could change as the technology matures, so the quantum
technology  supply  chain  could  remain  in  flux  for  the  next  several
years or even decades.396

BIS  has  identified  a  number  of  quantum  computing-related  tech-
nologies  for  export  controls.  In  September,  2022,  BIS  prohibited  ex-
port of quantum computing-related technology to Russia and Belar-
us, including quantum computers and certain components, cryogenic
refrigeration  systems  and  components,  ultra-high  vacuum  (UHV)
equipment, high quantum efficiency photodetectors and sources, and
software and technology related to each the development, production,

* Please note that the new BIS quantum controls announced in September 2024 likely overtake
some of the analysis in this subsection. Due to the timing of the release of these new controls rel-
ative to finalization of this report, their length (31 Federal Register pages), and the complexity of
both the Export Control Classification Number system and QIS-related technology supply chains,
a full analysis of the policy implications of those controls is beyond the scope of this report. U.S.

or use of the foregoing.* 397 In its September 2024 QIS-focused con-
trols, BIS took a broader approach, imposing controls on a variety of
new  Export  Control  Classification  Number  (ECCN)  product  catego-
ries and amending the scope of other existing ECCNs.† 398 The BIS
quantum  controls  cover  extremely  powerful  cooling  systems,  which
are  needed  to  reduce  heat  that  causes  errors  in  qubits  that  serve
as the building blocks of quantum computers.399 Although the Unit-
ed  States  produces  some  of  its  own  quantum  cryogenic  products,
it  is  allied  or  partner  countries—not  China—that  largely  make  up
the remainder of the supply chain for the refrigeration technologies
needed  in  quantum  devices.400 A  September  2022  report  by  Sandia
National  Laboratories  notes  that  aside  from  two  U.S.-based  man-
ufacturers  of  the  technology,  there  are  manufacturers  in  Canada,
France, Finland, the Netherlands, and the UK.401

Other potential key “chokepoint” components have been more dif-
ficult  to  identify.‡  A  2022  Hyperion  Research  survey  of  47  respon-
dents across the U.S. quantum computing supply base listed various
materials and products that respondents identified as the most like-
ly  potential  causes  of  quantum  computing  supply  chain  disruption
in  the  coming  years:  helium-3  gas,  silicon-28,  copper,  aluminum,
gold,  high-performance  cryocoolers,  pumps,  valves,  compressors,
power  supplies,  RF  generators,  superconducting  wiring  assemblies,
dilution fridge components, fiber and coaxial cables, low-noise lasers
at  relevant  atomic  wavelengths,  and  key  manufacturing  equipment
useful for quantum and classical chip manufacturing and testing.402
Some of those materials and components are likely to have multiple
sources of availability outside of the United States and allied coun-
tries. The September 2024 BIS quantum controls do apply to certain
QIS-related components.403 It is beyond the scope of this chapter to
further analyze these supply chains.

Biotechnology: State-Backed Firms Build Global Imprint

Biotechnology is an emerging field with wide-ranging commercial
and military applications and the potential to revolutionize various
key  sectors  of  the  economy.404  A  deeper  understanding  of  natural
systems, biochemistry, and genetics paired with increasingly power-
ful  tools  for  manipulating  cell  structures  has  resulted  in  improved
medicines and therapeutics, increased crop yields, new biofuels and
bioenergetics,  inorganic  substances,  and  advancements  in  materi-
al  science  and  manufacturing  processes.405  The  application  of  AI

* At the same time as the noted BIS action relating to QIS and Russia, U.S. Department of the
Treasury, Office of Foreign Assets Control imposed sanctions that prohibited “U.S. persons” locat-
ed  anywhere  in  the  world  from  exportation,  reexportation,  sale,  or  supply,  directly  or  indirectly,

in  biotechnology  holds  potential  to  be  an  accelerant  on  the  pace  of
discovery,  for  example  by  rapidly  filling  in  gaps  in  researchers’  un-
derstanding  of  gene  sequences.406  Though  the  full  extent  to  which
fast-advancing subfields like synthetic biology and gene editing will
reshape  the  realm  of  possibilities  using  living  organisms  is  not  yet
clear,  former  Google  CEO  and  Chairman  and  current  Commission-
er  on  the  National  Security  Commission  on  Emerging  Biotechnol-
ogy  Eric  Schmidt  said  in  April  2024  that  we  may  be  approaching
a  “ChatGPT”  moment  for  biotechnology,  one  as  ground-shifting  as
the  breakthrough  in  generative  AI  in  November  2022.407  The  im-
portance  of  the  technology  has  not  been  lost  on  China.  A  Chinese
Academy  of  Science  official  typified  the  strategic  emphasis  China
placed on biotechnology by stating, “As Europe won in the 19th cen-
tury using industry, and the United States won in the 20th century
using  information  technology,  so  China  will  win  in  the  21st  using
biology.” 408  This  section  will  examine  the  state  of  U.S.-China  bio-
technology  competition,  China’s  biotechnology  ambitions,  cases  of
concern, and the potential risks for the United States.

China  Rises  up  the  Value  Chain  in  Biopharma  despite

Lagging  in  Fundamental  Research

The  CCP’s  leadership  has  long  viewed  biotechnology—and  in
particular  biopharmaceuticals—as  a  critical  technology,  and  it  has
sought  to  become  a  leader  in  this  field  with  massive  state  support
for the sector.409 Starting with the 12th Five-Year Plan (2011–2015),
the  Chinese  government  shifted  its  strategy  in  the  sector  from  one
focused  on  growing  copycat  manufacturing  capabilities  toward
one  incentivizing  innovation  not  just  on  pharmaceuticals  but  also
across  agriculture  and  biomanufacturing.410  The  “Made  in  China
2025”  plan,  a  high-level  Chinese  policy  document  released  in  2015,
identified “biomedicine  and  high-end  medical  equipment”  and “new
materials,  such  as  polymers”  as  two  of  the  ten  key  sectors  set  for
state backing.411 The 14th Five-Year Plan for the Bioeconomy called
for investments in biotechnology across a range of industries to put
China “at the forefront globally” by 2035.412 Biotechnology has been
designated  a  strategic  emerging  industry  by  Beijing,  and  therefore
companies  enjoy  a  host  of  preferential  treatments,  including  tax
benefits,  subsidies,  and  government  procurement  benefits.413  The
government  has  also  supported  development  of  high-tech  science
parks where companies can cluster and have access to state-of-the-
art R&D facilities and equipment such as DNA sequencers.414

Though traditionally a copycat and maker of generic drugs, China
has  prioritized  success  in  biopharma,  investing  in  R&D  infrastruc-
ture and supporting biotech companies that have captured key seg-
ments of the value chain for genomic sequencing and biopharma.415
Additionally,  there  are  signs  that  the  Chinese  biopharma  sector  is
becoming more innovative, with metrics such as high-quality publi-
cations, patent filings, and approval of novel drugs on the rise.

China’s  efforts  have  resulted  in  some  significant  successes.  With
regard to biopharma, China increased its share of global value add-
ed  in  pharmaceuticals  from  5.6  percent  in  2002  to  24.2  percent  in
2019,  surpassing  the  EU.416  China’s  biotechnology  sector  has  been
the  recipient  of  sizable  investment  increases,  with  venture  capital,

217

equity funds, and IPOs providing funding to the tune of $216 billion
from  2015  to  2023.417  Seven  of  the  world’s  ten  largest  biopharma-
ceutical IPOs were by Chinese companies from 2018 to 2020, accord-
ing to McKinsey & Company, while the total combined market value
of  China’s  biopharmaceutical  industry  grew  exponentially  from  $3
billion in 2016 to more than $380 billion in 2021.418

Nevertheless,  until  very  recently,  China’s  biotechnology  indus-
try has struggled to deliver innovative new products, particularly
in  biopharmaceuticals.419  Chinese  funding  has  been  geared  more
toward experimental and translational research; China is not pri-
marily focusing on basic research, which remains an area in which
the United States leads.* 420 More than a dozen biotechnology ex-
perts  interviewed  by  Bloomberg  News  argue  that  the  persistent
lack  of  basic  research  in  China  has  stymied  domestic  innovation
by  failing  to  build  the  knowledge  foundation  on  which  to  explore
novel  applications.421  Academic  researchers  in  China  struggle
to  collaborate  with  biotech  firms  to  create  high-end  commercial
products,  and  as  a  result,  Chinese  biopharmaceutical  firms  have
produced  very  few  truly  innovative  medicines.422  Many  Chinese
biopharmaceutical  firms  continue  to  seek  to  “copycat”  products
developed  abroad.423  As  a  result,  Chinese  biopharma  firms  have
lagged  behind  in  bringing  novel  therapeutics  to  market  quickly,
as  was  the  case  with  China’s  mRNA  COVID-19  vaccines,  which
only  gained  approval  in  March  2023,  two  years  after  vaccines
developed  in  the  United  States.424

With  a  robust  life  sciences  innovation  ecosystem  comprising  top
universities, venture capital funding, and industry leading firms, the
United States has long been the global leader in biopharmaceuticals
and  non-pharmaceutical  biotechnology.  U.S.-headquartered  biotech
firms  lead  in  new  drug  development,  producing  twice  as  many  new
chemical or biological entities as those in Europe between 2014 and
2018.425  U.S.  firms  received  62  percent  of  global  venture  capital
funding in biotechnology in 2020, a figure that declined from 69 per-
cent  a  decade  earlier  but  still  far  exceeded  China  (19  percent)  and
Europe  (15  percent).† 426  Accounting  for  40  percent  of  the  world’s
total,  the  United  States  still  publishes  nearly  double  the  Patent

* From  2000  to  2019,  80  percent  of  China’s  R&D  expenditures  were  focused  on  experimental
development,  using  existing  knowledge  to  improve  products  and  processes,  compared  to  62  per-
cent in the same time period for the United States. This emphasis on translational research may
advantage  China  in  developing  products  for  defense  and  other  critical  sectors,  altering  human
genetic  structures,  and  some  other  applications.  As  Michelle  Rozo,  vice  chair  of  the  National
Security  Commission  on  Emerging  Biotechnology,  testified  before  the  Commission,  “A  system
that funds translational research is better poised to realize applications in certain biotechnology
sectors,  including  agriculture,  [industry],  and  defense.  In  a  way,  China  is  taking  advantage  of
American basic R&D by heavily funding translational research.” Michelle Rozo, written testimony
for the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, Hearing on Current and Emerging
Technologies in U.S.-China Economic and National Security Competition, February 1, 2024, 2–3.
† Funding  activity  for  biotechnology  in  the  United  States  boomed  during  the  COVID-19  pan-
demic, with venture capital and IPO follow-on funding both peaking at over twice their pre-pan-
demic  level  in  2021  before  falling  off  in  2022  and  2023.  The  collapse  of  Silicon  Valley  Bank  in
March 2023 further constrained funding, with an estimated 50 percent of U.S. biotech companies
banking  with  the  institution. There  are  signs  in  2024  that  the  industry  is  recovering,  driven  by
factors  like  investment  in  weight  loss  drugs  and  a  shifting  focus  from  IPOs  to  mergers  and  ac-
quisitions (M&A) activity. Gwendolyn Wu, “Private Biotech M&A Surges amid Difficult IPO Mar-

Cooperation Treaty  (PCT)  biotech-related  patents  as  China.427  U.S.
biotechnology  companies  attracted  $56.8  billion  in  total  funding  in
2023,  35  percent  of  the  world’s  total  in  comparison  to  $20.6  billion
to  Chinese  firms.428  There  are  positive  trends  for  China,  however.
Despite the U.S. lead in basic research, there are recent indications
that  Chinese  biotech  is  becoming  more  innovative  in  cutting-edge
research.  In  2023,  five  first-in-class  drugs  were  approved  in  China
and three by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, including the
first  FDA-approved  drug  to  treat  nasopharyngeal  cancer.429  There
were  33  licensing  deals  in  2024  between  Chinese  drug  makers  and
multinational enterprises.430 These are deals in which multination-
al companies license the IP created by a smaller company and typ-
ically signal some level of innovation in the product. The number of
licensing deals has more than doubled since 2019 and indicates the
increasing  confidence  of  international  companies  in  the  quality  of
Chinese  innovations.431  The  amount  of  high-quality  scientific  pub-
lications  from  Chinese  academics  has  overtaken  that  of  the  United
States in certain subfields, including novel antibiotics and antivirals
and  biomanufacturing.432  Chinese  researchers  have  also  made  sig-
nificant  strides  in  synthetic  biology,  the  replication  of  living  organ-
isms  or  creation  of  novel  materials,  therapeutics,  or  organisms.433
The Australian  Strategic  Policy  Institute  (ASPI)  ranks  Chinese  re-
search  in  synthetic  biology  ahead  of  the  United  States  in  terms  of
both the volume and quality of research published.434

Additionally,  Chinese  biotech  companies  have  become  indus-
try  leaders  in  genomic  sequencing,  mass  production  of  precursors,
and  intermediary  services  needed  by  innovative  pharma  and  bio-
tech  companies,  capturing  larger  segments  of  the  value  chain  as
contract  research  organizations  (CROs),  contract  manufacturing  or-
ganizations  (CMOs),  and  contract  development  and  manufacturing
organizations (CDMOs).435 A survey from Biotechnology Innovation
Organization,  a  trade  association,  found  that  of  124  U.S.  biotech
companies  that  responded,  79  percent  had  at  least  one  contract  or
product agreement with firms based in China or owned by China for
services such as gene sequencing, data management, and conducting
clinical trials.436

Chinese Firms Become Major Players in Genomics

China  has  significant  capabilities  in  genomics.  Genomics  is  the
study  of  an  entire  organism’s  genetic  sequence,  including  that  of
humans.437  The  Chinese  government  has  a  longstanding  interest
in  the  development  of  genomics,  funding  its  development  since  the
early  2000s.438  In  2023,  the  National  Natural  Science  Foundation
under the State Council named Chinese research in genomics as one
of the “ten major advancements in Chinese science.” 439

The  ability  to  analyze  vast  quantities  of  genomic  data  has  been
likened to the holy grail of drug discovery, while giving distinct ad-
vantages  in  healthcare  for  diagnosing  medical  conditions  and  in
determining  predispositions  for  disease.440  Yet,  genomics  and  syn-
thetic biology can also be used for malevolent purposes, such as sur-
veillance  using  bioindicators  and  to  make  more  virulent  pathogens
that may one day be capable of targeting subsections of populations
based on shared genetic signatures.441

219

China  has  significant  advantages  in  genomic  data.  China  has
pursued  a  comprehensive  state-led  effort  to  amass  genetic  data  on
humans  and  living  organisms  around  the  world  stored  in  a  central
repository  known  as  the  China  National  GeneBank.442  Given  the
nature of innovation in biotechnology, access to a massive amount of
genetic data could accelerate the pace of discovery and development
in  emerging  subfields  like  synthetic  biology,  providing  the  Chinese
R&D  community  an  advantage  in  the  next  evolution  of  biotechnol-
ogy. The Chinese government designated genetic data as a national
strategic  resource  in  2022,  and  it  restricts  the  transfer  of  genetic
information to parties outside of China.443

Chinese  firms  are  becoming  main  drivers  in  genomics  research
and  global  leaders  in  providing  genetic  sequencing  and  related  ge-
nomics services.444 Principal among these is BGI Group, which was
initially founded as the Beijing Genomics Institute in 1999 to serve
as China’s representative to the U.S.-led Human Genome Project, an
international  research  collaboration  in  sequencing  human  DNA.445
Over the subsequent two decades, BGI’s research has expanded from
mapping  the  human  genome  to  groundbreaking  research  on  map-
ping primate brains and sequencing blood samples to identify virus-
es.446 The firm has also made strides in developing low-cost genome
testing services and marketing them abroad, building a global brand
as  a  commercial  genetic  sequencing  firm.447 As  a  global  competitor
in  genomics,  BGI  has  grown  to  become  one  of  the  world’s  largest
genetic  sequencing  firms  by  capacity,  with  $973  million  (RMB  7.05
billion)  in  revenue  in  2022.448  The  company  maintains  offices  and
research  laboratories  across  the  world,  including  in  Europe,  Japan,
and  the  United  States,  and  has  distributed  testing  products  in  at
least 80 countries.449 During the COVID-19 pandemic, BGI deployed
genetic  testing  labs  in  more  than  20  countries  around  the  world
capable  of  collecting  genetic  data,  which  has  raised  concerns  that
China is engaged in a concerted effort to amass genetic data abroad
while walling off domestic data.450 As of October 2024, BGI’s market
capitalization was $2.6 billion, well behind industry leader Illumina
($23.7  billion)  and  other  peer  genomics  companies,  yet  the  compa-
ny  has  shown  prowess  in  scaling  globally  and  expanding  market
share.451  BGI  also  runs  China’s  National  GeneBank,  overseeing
millions  of  genetic  samples  in  cooperation  with  the  National  De-
velopment  and  Reform  Commission  and  Ministry  of  Health,  among
other  Chinese  government  agencies.452 Amid  this  close  government
collaboration,  BGI  has  benefited  from  favorable  state-led  subsidies,
including a $1.5 billion ten-year loan from the state-controlled Chi-
na Development Bank.453

Other  Chinese  firms  are  becoming  leading  firms  in  genomics,
too.  Beijing-based  Novogene  has  created  a  dominant  presence  in
next-generation genetic sequencing—DNA sequencing that provides
higher-volume, faster, and cheaper genetic sequencing capabilities—
completing 1.2 million samples as of 2021.454 To develop its genetic
sequencing  capabilities,  the  firm  has  sought  out  research  partner-
ships with U.S. partners, a pattern in Chinese-based biotech firms.455
This includes the establishment of a “genome sequencing center” on
the campus of University of California, Davis meant to research and
refine genetic sequencing capabilities.456 In 2022, Novogene also set

220

up a genome sequencing facility in San Jose, California, positioning
it to offer genetic sequencing services to U.S. biotechnology firms in
Silicon Valley.457

China’s  Biotech  Industry  Is  Deeply  Interconnected  with  U.S.

Firms

Chinese  companies  have  become  integral  in  U.S.  pharmaceutical
supply  chains,  leading  to  dependencies  and  heightened  risk  of  the
transfer  of  sensitive  health  data  of  U.S.  citizens.*  A  few  Chinese
companies  do  have  significant  globally  competitive  capabilities  in
genomic  sequencing  and  biotech  services  for  innovative  companies.
The  virtues  of  an  open  and  collaborative  research  environment  be-
tween  the  United  States  and  China  have  been  extolled  by  many  in
the  scientific  community,  yet  national  security  experts  have  raised
concerns  particularly  around  the  possible  transfer  of  sensitive
health  data  of  U.S.  citizens,  which  could  enable  China’s  technology
advancement and create vulnerabilities for Americans.458

Chinese companies have been able to capture market share as pro-
viders  of  services  such  as  genetic  sequencing,  offering  intermediate
services and conducting clinical trials, lowering the cost and occupy-
ing a significant space in the biopharma supply chain in the United
States  and  globally.  Despite  growing  evidence  of  collaboration  with
the  PLA,  Chinese  genomics  firm  BGI  and  other  major  internation-
al  biotech  player WuXi  have  longstanding  operations  in  the  United
States,  enabling  them  to  conduct  U.S.-based  R&D.459  Since  2010,
BGI  has  operated  its  BGI Americas  laboratory  in  Cambridge,  Mas-
sachusetts,  and  in  2013  BGI  acquired  U.S.-based  DNA  sequencing
firm Complete Genomics.460 BGI was a main supplier of COVID-19
test kits in the United States, providing 35 million COVID-19 tests
to  U.S.  users  by  August  2020.† 461  Reporting  from  the  Washington
Post  in  September  2023  details  how  BGI  collected  vast  amounts  of
genetic  data  from  populations  around  the  world  during  the  pan-
demic  by  deploying  its  Fire-Eye  labs—portable  labs  that  analyzed
genetic  samples  for  traces  of  COVID-19—in  over  20  countries.462
BGI  has  also  conducted  extensive  research  collaborations  with  U.S.
firms  and  institutions,  including  partnerships  with  the  University
of California and the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia on human
genome sequencing.463

WuXi Group Raises Dependency and Security Concerns
WuXi  Group  encompasses  a  constellation  of  integrated  CROs
and CDMOs known as contract research, development, and man-
ufacturing organizations (CRDMOs) that specialize in services re-
lated to drug development and production.464 WuXi has expanded
market presence in the United States and Europe, with WuXi Bi-
ologics and WuXi AppTech among the two largest subsidiaries.465

from this attack have been used or made available within China for biomedical-related research.

WuXi Group Raises Dependency and Security Concerns—
Continued
These  firms  have  become  integral  to  the  U.S.  pharmaceutical  in-
dustry: it is estimated that WuXi has been involved in developing
one-fourth  of  the  drugs  currently  used  in  the  United  States.466
For  example,  it  has  developed  key  ingredients  for  drugs  used  in
treatments for HIV, cystic fibrosis, obesity, and cancers like some
types  of  leukemia  and  lymphoma.467  About  two-thirds  of  WuXi
AppTech’s  revenue  ($3.6  billion)  came  from  the  U.S.  market  in
2023.* 468  As  the  firm  has  expanded  its  footprint  in  the  United
States,  it  has  benefited  from  state  and  local  subsidies,  including
an  $11.5  million  tax  break  to  build  a  manufacturing  plant  in
Massachusetts  and  a  $19  million  subsidy  to  build  a  manufactur-
ing site in Delaware.469

WuXi’s  role  in  the  U.S.  drug  development  and  manufacturing
market  raises  significant  concerns  that  a  key  U.S.  industry  has
become reliant on a Chinese company with links to the PLA.† 470
Many companies that contract with Chinese-based CRDMOs like
WuXi  Group  have  expressed  concerns  that  a  disruption  in  these
contracts  would  present  major  setbacks  for  drug  development
timelines. One survey of 105 U.S. biotechnology companies found
over  90  percent  would  expect  delays  in  their  development  pipe-
line  if  they  were  forced  to  switch  from  a  China-based  CRDMO
and  64  percent  saying  this  would  constitute  a “substantial  slow-
down.” 471  Another  survey—as  previously  mentioned—from  the
trade group Biotechnology Innovation Organization (BIO) yielded
similar results, with 79 percent of 124 biopharma companies sur-
veyed saying they had at least one contract with a China-based or
-owned CRDMO; the survey indicated that fully unwinding these
partnerships  would  take  up  to  eight  years.472  This  comes  at  a
moment  when  the  U.S.  pharmaceutical  industry  is  dealing  with
active drug shortages near all-time highs.473

WuXi’s  position  in  the  drug  development  pipeline  grants  it  po-
tential  access  to  U.S.  clients’  proprietary  IP  and  know-how.474
Furthermore,  the  company’s  recent  expansion  into  genomics
makes  the  collection  of  genetic  data  a  core  component  of  its  ser-
vices,  raising  concern  over  the  potential  transfer  of  genetic  data
of U.S. persons.475

In  light  of  both  firms’  alleged  ties  to  the  Chinese  military,  U.S.
policymakers are seeking to limit their reach into the United States

* In 2015, WuXi purchased an ownership stake in U.S. genetic sequencing firm 23andMe, which
company representatives claimed in 2021 amounted to less than 1 percent. For more on Chinese
firms  investing  in  U.S.  genetic  sequencing  firms,  see  U.S.-China  Economic  and  Security  Review

Warns of Efforts by China to Collect Genetic Data,” New York Times, October 22, 2021.

† In June 2024, it was reported that WuXi AppTec employees were listed as co-inventors along-
side  scientists  from  the  PLA  General  Hospital  in  Beijing  on  at  least  ten  patents  for  altitude
sickness drugs in recent years. This follows documented links between the company and the CCP

and access to U.S. genetic data.476 In the last three years, the Com-
merce  Department  placed  BGI  subsidiaries  on  the  BIS  Entity  List
and the Pentagon has labeled BGI a Chinese military company, both
moves  that  significantly  limit  BGI’s  ability  to  work  with  U.S.  firms
and  to  access  U.S.  technologies.477  Yet  limiting  these  firms’  access
to  the  U.S.  market  poses  challenges  given  their  extensive  network
of  U.S.  subsidiaries  and  partnerships  and  deep  involvement  in  nu-
merous  pharmaceutical  R&D  supply  chains.478  For  example,  MGI
Group, which sells gene sequencing equipment in the United States,
avoided the first round of government sanctions on BGI despite be-
ing  a  subsidiary  of  BGI  until  being  spun  out  in  2022.479  Although
the firm claims to be a “completely different company,” BGI’s founder
and  chairman Wang  Jian  holds  47  percent  of  MGI  shares  following
MGI’s  public  listing.480  Members  of  Congress  have  called  for  MGI
to be named a “Chinese military company” along with other alleged
BGI  subsidiaries  that  have  avoided  sanctions  as  of  April  2024,  in-
cluding genetic sequencing firms Innomics and STOmics.481

Other Chinese biotech firms have also sought collaborations with
U.S. firms and research institutions. VCanBio Cell and Engineering
Corporation,  which  markets  itself  as  China’s  largest  biotechnology
firm, boasts a 15,000-square-foot research center and a facility with
an explicit focus on translating advancements in biological research,
both  near  Boston.482  Another  Chinese  firm,  QLB  Biotherapeutics,
similarly  oversees  a  biotech  incubator  in  Boston,  with  QLB  aiming
to invest in U.S. biotech startups housed in the incubator and to ac-
quire  the  rights  to  any  therapeutics  the  Chinese-owned,  U.S.-based
incubator produces.483

Chinese  State  Support  Helped  Create  One  of  the  World’s

Largest  Bio-Agriculture  Companies

China has pursued its biotechnology ambitions in bio-agriculture,
seeking  to  enhance  agricultural  processes  to  create  higher  yields
and  stronger  crop  resiliency,  benefits  that  are  sought  after  in  Chi-
na  due  to  the  country’s  longstanding  concerns  surrounding  food
insecurity.484  As  Chinese  companies  have  become  major  players  in
an  already  highly  concentrated  global  agribusiness  industry,  there
are  growing  concerns  about  overdependency.  Chinese  firms  have
aggressively  registered  bio-agricultural  patents  and  are  now  the
global  leaders  in  government  funding  of  agricultural  R&D,  accord-
ing  to  2022  estimates  by  the  U.S.  Department  of Agriculture’s  Eco-
nomic  Research  Service.485  China’s  progress  in  genome  sequencing
and  analysis,  which  can  be  leveraged  in  the  agricultural  industry
for  genetically  engineering  agricultural  products,  is  also  gaining
ground.486  A  2022  study  found  Chinese  scientists  had  published
more papers concerning crop genomics and plant gene editing tech-
nologies in recent years than any other country.487

To  achieve  its  bio-agricultural  ambitions,  the  Party-state  has
staunchly backed the growth of its largest state-owned firms.488 One
such  state-owned  company  is  ChemChina,  China’s  largest  chemi-
cal  company,  which  in  2017  purchased  Swiss-based  seed-producing
giant  Syngenta,  a  leading  firm  in  bio-agriculture.489  A  major  state
support  component  was  included  as  part  of  the  $44  billion  acqui-
sition,  with  the  Bank  of  China  providing  a  $10  billion  bond  and

223

another worth $7 billion coming from China Reform Holdings Corp,
a state-owned asset manager.490 Recent consolidation of global agri-
cultural companies has increased Syngenta’s market share, enabling
China to position itself strategically in the bio-agricultural sector.491
According to Michelle Rozo, vice chair of the National Security Com-
mission  on  Emerging  Biotechnology,  following  ChemChina’s  acqui-
sition  of  Syngenta,  four  companies  now  control  large  segments  of
agricultural biotechnology and other agricultural inputs: U.S.-based
Corteva,  German-based  Bayer  and  BASF,  and  Syngenta.492  These
four firms are now responsible for the vast majority of pesticide and
seed  treatment  research  and  manufacturing.493  They  also  conduct
most  global  seed  research,  developing  genetically  engineered  (GE) *
seeds that they themselves sell or license to other firms.† 494

Chinese  state  ownership  of  Syngenta  affords  Beijing  influence
over  global  agricultural  markets,  disadvantaging  U.S.  companies.
The Chinese government is both the key biotechnology regulator in
China  and  the  owner  of  a  major  bio-agriculture  firm  that  competes
with other firms it regulates, including U.S. firms.495 Therefore, Syn-
genta  is  in  a  privileged  position  of  being  owned  by  the  same  entity
that  regulates  matters  vital  to  the  firm’s  success.496 This  beneficial
regulatory  relationship  with  the  country’s  largest  domestic  agricul-
tural  firm  occurs  as  Chinese  regulators  continue  to  stymie  foreign
competitors.497 According to Dr. Rozo, the Chinese government rou-
tinely  slows  licensing  for  U.S.  firms  to  market  GE  crops  in  China
and exploits samples of U.S.-produced GE seeds to develop domestic
competitors  on  a  reduced  timeline.498  This  is  a  direct  violation  of
China’s  WTO  commitments  and  agreements  made  as  part  of  the
Phase One trade deal, where Chinese authorities agreed to efficient-
ly review and approve U.S.-made biotechnology products.499 Accord-
ing  to  a  report  from  the  Office  of  the  U.S.  Trade  Representative
(USTR), China’s lagging approval process of U.S.-made biotechnolo-
gy  goods “remains  among  the  most  significant  commitments  under
the  Phase  One  agreement  for  which  China  has  not  demonstrated
full implementation.” 500 In one instance of delayed licensing, after a

† The  Chinese  acquisition  of  Syngenta,  which  had  to  be  cleared  by  the  Committee  on  Foreign
Investment  in  the  United  States,  also  faced  opposition  by  U.S.  agricultural  stakeholders  on  se-
curity  grounds.  Previously,  Syngenta  had  led  major  research  programs  relevant  to  U.S.  military
interests, particularly in biofuels. As highlighted in testimony by Dr. Rozo, now that Syngenta is a
Chinese SOE, it could withhold biofuel advancements from the U.S. military, a concern expressed
by domestic farming unions at the time of the ChemChina acquisition deal. Furthermore, several
of Syngenta’s U.S. agricultural facilities are near U.S. military facilities, raising concerns by some
that  Syngenta’s  ostensibly  commercial  research  sites  could  serve  as  covert  research  sites  near
U.S.  national  security  activities.  Following  Syngenta’s  acquisition  by  ChemChina,  the  state  of
Arkansas announced investigations into Syngenta’s ownership of land in the state. After finding
that  the  company  did  not  properly  disclose  its  Chinese  ownership,  the  company  was  ordered  to
sell 160 acres of land. Nova J. Daly, written testimony before the Committee on Agriculture U.S.

decade-long wait, the Chinese government in 2023 finally approved
licenses for U.S. firm Corteva to market product grown in the Unit-
ed  States  using  a  GE  canola  seed.501  However,  due  to  the  delayed
timeline, that canola variety had become outdated.502

Since  acquiring  Syngenta,  the  Chinese  government  continues
to  assert  its  position  in  the  global  bio-agriculture  sector.  In  2020,
the  State  Council’s  State-Owned  Assets  Supervision  and  Adminis-
tration  Commission  began  combining  agricultural  assets  of  Chem-
China  and  other  firms  under  the  Syngenta  name.503  The  resulting
Chinese  state-owned  Syngenta  is  now  the  world’s  largest  seed  and
agrochemicals  conglomerate,  with  $27  billion  of  annual  sales  and
major  markets  across  Europe,  North  America,  Latin  America,  and
Africa.504  Since  2021,  Syngenta  has  also  reportedly  been  planning
a  Shanghai  IPO  worth  as  much  as  $10  billion,  which  could  provide
the firm with RMB liquidity to facilitate Chinese government-direct-
ed  acquisitions  of  emergent  bio-agricultural  companies.* 505  If  the
Syngenta  case  is  illustrative,  there  may  be  further  consolidation  of
international bio-agricultural firms under direct Chinese state own-
ership.506

AI May Enhance China’s Biotech Ambitions

Chinese breakthroughs in biotech for both commercial and mil-
itary  sectors  can  be  propelled  by  AI  and  advances  in  machine
learning,  according  to  Dr.  Rozo’s  testimony  before  the  Commis-
sion.507 AI  and  machine  learning  can  be  applied  to  assist  in  an-
alyzing  genetic  codes,  conducting  image  analysis  for  agriculture
and  medical  diagnostics,  and  running  autonomous  experimenta-
tion to accelerate the speed of cutting-edge technological develop-
ment.508  Dr.  Rozo  testified  that  nearly  every  area  of  biology  has
advanced  through  the  use  of  AI/machine  learning  tools  and  will
continue  to  do  so  as  the  data  and  models  improve.509  Chinese
firms  already  claim  to  be  benefiting  from  this  AI-biotech  nex-
us.510 Insilico Medicine, with headquarters in Hong Kong, claims
to have used AI in pharmaceutical development to reduce a mul-
tiyear  discovery  process  down  to  18  months  and  at  a  fraction  of
the cost.511 BioMap, a biotech firm with headquarters in Beijing,
claims  to  have  developed  an AI  Foundation  Model  with  over  100
billion parameters to speed drug discovery.512

A  key  aspect  of  the  AI-biotech  nexus  is  quality  data.  Accord-
ing  to  the  U.S.  National  Counterintelligence  and  Security  Cen-
ter,  China  “has  enacted  national  policies  prioritizing  the  collec-
tion  of  healthcare  data  both  at  home  and  abroad  to  achieve  its
goal  of  becoming  a  global  biotech  leader”  and  has  collected  large
datasets from the United States and other countries.513 Dr. Rozo
argues  that  thanks  to  government  support,  China’s  biotech  eco-
system  may  be  better  suited  than  the  United  States  to  utilize
AI  and  other  emerging  technologies  to  advance  biotech  research,
particularly  given  its  National  Genome  Sequencing  Data  Center
and  BGI’s  significant  role  in  providing  genomic  sequencing  ser-

vices.514  Similarly,  WuXi  Apptec’s  role  in  numerous  biotech  sup-
ply  chains  provides  WuXi  access  to  a  wide  variety  of  otherwise
proprietary  data.  “It  appears  that  the  Chinese  system  is  better
oriented towards convergent [AI-enhanced biotech] research,” Dr.
Rozo testified, and “the Chinese government has been prioritizing
this intersection at a national level for years, while the U.S. Gov-
ernment has yet to do so at the same scale.” 515

Batteries:  China’s  State  Support  Powers  Growing  Market

Dominance

From  powering  EVs  to  supporting  the  U.S.  power  grid,  battery
technology  plays  an  increasingly  crucial  role  in  the  U.S.  economy
and  military  readiness.516  The  U.S.  battery  market,  already  esti-
mated  at  $16.9  billion  in  2023,  is  expected  to  more  than  double  by
2030 with the transition to battery-powered vehicles and the instal-
lation of more batteries in energy systems.517 In contrast to the oth-
er  technologies  examined  in  this  chapter  where  the  United  States
and China are competing to gain a clear advantage, China currently
dominates  nearly  all  stages  of  battery  production.518  Six  out  of  the
world’s  top  ten  battery  producers  are  based  in  China,  accounting
for  77  percent  of  global  production  capacity *  as  of  2022,  compared
to  just  6  percent  for  the  United  States.519 This  advantage  is  set  to
continue,  with  energy  data  firm  BloombergNEF  projecting  that  by
2025 and beyond, China will maintain at least three times as much
battery  production  capacity  as  the  rest  of  the  world  combined.520
With  China’s  leading  role  in  battery  production,  the  United  States
has  become  increasingly  dependent  on  China  for  finished  batteries
as well as battery technology, components, and materials.521 Despite
recent attempts to reduce U.S. reliance on Chinese batteries, China
remains the leading battery exporter to the United States, account-
ing for over 70 percent of lithium-ion batteries imported in 2023 by
price  and  over  50  percent  of  all  electric  storage  batteries,  including
separators and parts.522

China’s Dominance in the Battery Supply Chain

China  has  attained  a  sizable  advantage  at  each  stage  of  the
battery  supply  chain,  from  upstream  mining  of  raw  materials,  to
midstream  processing  and  fabrication  of  components,  and  finally  to
downstream assembly and production of finished batteries.523 In its
14th Five-Year Plan for Raw Material Industry Development, China
describes raw materials as the “foundation of the real economy” and
a  “main  battlefield  for  industrial  green  development.” 524  China’s
success in battery manufacturing stems in large part from its lead-
ing  position  in  producing  and  processing  critical  minerals.† 525  As

* Production  capacity  refers  to  the  maximum  potential  manufacturing  capacity  a  country  can

produce of a given good; for batteries, it is measured in gigawatt hours (GWh).

† Critical minerals currently include 50 minerals and elements considered essential to the eco-
nomic or national security of the United States. They are vulnerable to supply chain disruptions
and are used in manufacturing of a product that, if curtailed, would have significant consequenc-
es  for  U.S.  interests  (e.g.,  lithium,  cobalt,  graphite,  gallium,  germanium,  nickel,  tin,  etc.).  U.S.
Department of the Interior, U.S. Geological Survey, What Is A Critical Mineral?

226

of  January  2024,  China  is  responsible  for  60  percent  of  the  world’s
rare  earths  mining  production,  a  subset  of  critical  minerals  crucial
not  only  for  battery  production  but  also  for  defense  technologies,
including missiles, lasers, and tanks.526

Chinese  firms  have  augmented  their  significant  domestic  pro-
cessing  and  refining  of  rare  earths  by  securing  mining  agreements
with resource-rich countries to secure supply of the critical minerals
used  in  batteries.527  Nickel,  lithium,  and  cobalt  are  vital  inputs  for
battery  manufacturing  for  which  China  lacks  substantial  domes-
tic  resources.528  In  2022,  China  signed  a  $14  billion  deal  to  mine
nickel  in  Indonesia  and  a  $422  million  deal  for  lithium  mining  in
Zimbabwe,  complementing  existing  agreements  in  the  Democratic
Republic of the Congo, where Chinese firms own 80 percent of cobalt
mining.529  Chinese  firms  continue  to  expand  control  of  the  global
critical mineral mining industry. According to GlobalData, the num-
ber  of  planned  critical  mineral  mines  either  under  development  or
set  for  exploration  by  Chinese  companies  outside  of  China  is  set  to
more  than  double  to  89,  up  from  the  40  currently  in  operation.530
Many  of  these  planned  mines  are  set  to  operate  in  developing  Belt
and Road Initiative member countries in Africa and Southeast Asia,
where Chinese investment in metals and mining is reaching record
highs.531

In  line  with  government  directives  for  rare  earth  and  raw  ma-
terial  enterprises  to  consolidate  and  extend  their  industrial  chains
further downstream, China has also invested heavily in refining ca-
pabilities,  constructing  factories  domestically  and  abroad  to  bolster
and  enhance  its  ability  to  process  the  materials  needed  to  produce
batteries.532  China  now  processes  and  refines  90  percent  of  the
world’s rare earths and a significant portion of other critical miner-
als needed for lithium-ion batteries, including 95 percent of manga-
nese,  70  percent  of  cobalt  and  graphite,  66  percent  of  lithium,  and
over  60  percent  of  nickel.533  This  includes  a  Chinese-owned  $300
million  lithium  processing  plant  in  Zimbabwe  that  reportedly  has
the  capacity  to  process  4.5  million  metric  tons  of  hard  rock  lithium
annually for export; Zimbabwe has one of the largest concentrations
of  lithium  reserves  in  Africa.534  According  to  Rodrigo  Castillo  and
Caitlin  Purdy  at  the  Brookings  Institution,  China’s  state-owned  in-
vestment  bank  CITIC  also  boosts  China’s  refining  capabilities  by
channeling  government  funds  to  support  Chinese  firms,  including
Chengdu-based  Tianqi’s  overseas  lithium  refining  operations.535  At
the  same  time  China  is  investing  in  refining  capabilities,  efforts
to  upgrade  resource-refining  capabilities  in  the  United  States  and
Europe  are  facing  pushback  due  to  health  and  environmental  con-
cerns.536

Downstream, China is further solidifying its lead in battery man-
ufacturing.  China  has  invested  heavily  in  manufacturing  battery
components  and  with  subsidies  for  battery  manufacturing  compa-
nies  for  years.537 The  Chinese  government  has  designated  the  bat-
tery and EV industry as an industry of strategic importance since at
least 2010, when it was specifically identified as a matter of priority
by  the  State  Council.538  Support  for  the  development  of  the  “new
energy  vehicle”  industry  was  included  in  the  12th  Five-Year  Plan
(2011–2015),  in  the  Energy-Saving  and  New  Energy Vehicle  Indus-

227

try Development Plan (2012–2020), and as one of the ten industrial
priorities in Made in China 2025.539 The most recent 14th Five-Year
Plan  (2021–2025)  names  new  energy  vehicles  as  a  strategic  emerg-
ing industry, and a New Energy Vehicle Industry Development Plan
(2021–2035)  outlines  advancement  objectives  in  efficiency,  global
market share, and integration of autonomous driving systems.540 A
2024 report from the Center for Strategic and International Studies
estimates  that  between  2009  and  2023,  Chinese  government  sup-
port for the EV and battery industry totaled at least $230.9 billion,
equivalent  to  18.8  percent  of  total  EV  sales  of  Chinese  car  compa-
nies.541 The  subsidization  has  continued,  even  as  China  dominates
global battery production. Notably, Fujian-based Contemporary Am-
perex Technology Co., Ltd. (CATL) received $391 million (RMB 2.85
billion) in government support over the first six months of 2023.542
This constituted a nearly threefold increase in government subsidies
year-over-year  for  a  company  that  comprises  36.8  percent  of  global
market share of batteries for EVs.543

Buoyed  by  strong  government  backing,  as  of  2023,  Chinese  firms
produced  77  percent  of  all  battery  cathodes  produced  globally,  74
percent  of  separators,  82  percent  of  electrolytes,  and  92  percent  of
anodes  at  a  fraction  of  the  cost  compared  to  U.S.  competitors.* 544
This environment has also allowed Chinese battery makers to devel-
op batteries key to powering future cutting-edge products.545 For ex-
ample, a new condensed battery produced by CATL claims to main-
tain  an  energy  density  of  up  to  500  watt-hours  per  kilogram  (Wh/
kg).546 This  is  an  energy  density  above  the  projected  requirements
needed  to  power  a  future  fully  electrified  airplane.547  Meanwhile,
Chinese  breakthroughs  in  solid-state  batteries  are  set  to  broaden
the  efficiency  and  duration  with  which  Chinese  automotive  manu-
facturers can power the newest generation of EVs.548 With such an
extensive array of subsidies and existing market dominance of near-
ly all battery components, Chinese firms are poised to continue dom-
inating global battery markets, including in the United States.549

China’s Dominance in EVs

As  automotive  firms  increasingly  focus  on  the  production  of
EVs,  China’s  car  manufacturers  are  well  positioned.  The  global
EV  market,  which  already  grew  from  $384.65  billion  in  2022  to
$500.48 billion in 2023, is projected by Fortune Business Insights
to  more  than  triple  by  2030,  with  significant  growth  in  the Asia
Pacific.550 About  60  percent  of  total  EV  batteries  sold  globally  in
2022  were  made  in  China.551  This  creates  dependencies  on  Chi-
nese-produced  EV  batteries  for  U.S.  automakers,  while  Chinese
EV  manufacturers  work  to  vertically  integrate  domestic  battery
production into their supply chains in order to solidify first mover
advantages and ascend the ranks of global auto manufacturers.552
According  to  the  Center  for  Strategic  and  International  Stud-
ies, China’s investment in EV batteries has been backed by about

* Most  batteries  comprise  the  same  basic  components,  including  positively  charged  cathodes,
negatively  charged  anodes,  electrolytes  made  up  of  lithium  salts  needed  for  conductivity,  and
a  porous  separator  to  prevent  the  positive  and  negative  sides  from  touching.  Agnes  Chang  and

China’s Dominance in EVs—Continued

$130  billion  in  government-led  research  incentives,  government
contracts, and consumer subsidies.553 While Chinese battery sub-
sidies consistently cost the Chinese government billions of dollars
a  year,  they  combine  with  relatively  low  labor  costs  and  signifi-
cant  manufacturing  expertise  to  allow  Chinese  firms  to  produce
battery  packs  for  EVs  at  a  cost  of  $127  per  kilowatt  hour  com-
pared to their North American and European competitors, whose
costs  are  24  percent  and  33  percent  higher,  respectively.554  Chi-
nese EV battery factories can also be constructed at a price more
than $200 million less than a potential counterpart in Europe.555
While  some  countries  are  seeking  to  diversify  away  from  Chi-
nese batteries, this is costly in the near term. BloombergNEF es-
timates  that  the  EU  and  the  United  States  would  need  to  spend
$98 billion and $82 billion each in initial manufacturing construc-
tion alone to meet domestic battery demand in order to cut their
market  reliance  on  China.556  The  EU  further  estimates  it  will
need to spend an additional $412 billion (€382 billion) across the
entire  battery  supply  chain  to  eliminate  its  reliance  on  Chinese
battery  imports  and  achieve  self-sufficiency  by  2030.557  As  a  re-
sult  of  China’s  dominant  position  in  EV  battery  making,  most
global  EV  makers  are  set  to  continue  to  depend  on  China—at
least  in  the  short  term—including  Tesla,  which  relies  on  China
for 40 percent of its battery supply chain.558

Major  Chinese  EV  manufacturers,  like  BYD,  have  capitalized
on  China’s  battery  manufacturing  advantages.559  Unlike  U.S.
competitors, BYD controls nearly all aspects of its battery supply
chain.560 The  firm,  which  was  founded  as  a  battery  manufactur-
ing  business,  owns  over  20  battery-making  plants  in  China,  in-
cluding  one  of  the  world’s  largest  battery-making  plants  with  a
24-gigawatt-hour  (GWh)  capacity  in  Qinghai  Province.561  BYD’s
stakes  in  resource  mining  allow  the  firm  to  lock  in  discounts  in
sourcing  raw  materials  to  make  batteries.562  Like  other  Chinese
firms,  BYD  has  benefited  from  strong  government  support,  with
direct  subsidies  of  over  $3.7  billion  between  2018  and  2022,  ac-
cording to the Kiel Institute.563 Amid this generous state support,
BYD  has  plans  to  open  more  battery  factories  and  consolidate
much  of  its  upstream  battery-manufacturing  sourcing,  including
gaining ownership stakes in lithium mining operations, exploring
joint  ventures  in  nickel  mining,  and  developing  sodium-ion  bat-
teries.564

Chinese  firms  are  now  poised  to  dominate  global  sales  of  EVs.
One  estimate  finds  that  Chinese  EVs  are  set  to  account  for  one-
third  of  global  market  share  by  the  end  of  this  decade,  increas-
ing  market  share  outside  of  China  from  3  percent  in  2024  to  13
percent in 2030.565 BYD has become a major player in the global
EV market, dominating domestic and foreign firms in China’s EV
market  while  surpassing  Tesla  in  global  sales  of  battery  EVs  in
the  last  quarter  of  2023,  thanks  to  Chinese  government  support
and strong domestic supply chains.566 Other Chinese EV firms al-
ready operating at home in what is the world’s largest automotive
market  have  established  beachheads  abroad  and  are  surging  in

229

China’s Dominance in EVs—Continued

international  EV  markets.  Hangzhou-based  Geely  Auto  reported
a  48  percent  year-on-year  increase  in  2023  EV  sales,  with  more
than  270,000  Geely  EVs  sold  outside  of  China.567  State-owned
SAIC  reported  an  18.8  percent  increase  in  its  2023  overseas  EV
sales  year-over-year  and  has  unveiled  plans  to  begin  promoting
14 new EV models for foreign markets by 2025.568

Many countries will gladly accept China’s low-cost EVs, indicat-
ing that China’s market share is likely to increase and ultimately
displace existing suppliers in those markets, a development likely
to  cut  into  the  revenue  of  U.S.  automakers  from  sales  overseas.
Some  countries  have  resisted  them  over  concerns  that  China’s
massive subsidies for the sector have created unfair competition.
The  United  States  and  Canada  in  2024  both  announced  a  100
percent tariff on EVs imported from China, and the EU imposed
tariffs  ranging  from  17  to  38  percent  on  top  of  the  existing  10
percent  tariff  on  all  imported  cars.569  Brazil,  which  became  the
largest import market for Chinese EVs in 2024, is in the process
of  gradually  increasing  tariffs  on  imported  vehicles  from  zero  to
35 percent by 2026 in order to protect domestic industry.570

Batteries as Key Components of Global Electrical Grids

Chinese  batteries  also  play  a  crucial  role  in  providing  electrical
storage equipment for power grids worldwide, including in the Unit-
ed  States.  China  is  increasingly  supporting  and  subsidizing  what
it  calls  “new-type  energy  storage  systems”  (NTESS),  energy  sys-
tems that use novel technologies to store and distribute power, such
as  battery  energy  storage  systems  (BESS),  compressed  air  energy
storage,  and  flywheel  systems,  among  others.571  As  of  2023,  Chi-
na’s  installed  NTESS  capacity  stood  at  13.1  gigawatts  (GW),  with
lithium-ion  batteries  utilized  in  these  systems  accounting  for  28.7
percent  of  the  world’s  total  deployed  power  capacity  for  lithium-ion
batteries.572  These  energy  storage  systems  are  central  to  China’s
five-year  plans  at  both  the  national  and  provincial  level,  with  tar-
gets  to  reach  100  GW  in  cumulative  battery  storage  capacity  by
2030.573  In  contrast,  the  United  States  had  a  total  energy  storage
system  capacity  of  17  GW  by  the  end  of  2023.574  With  China  the
global leader in energy storage systems, the United States imported
a record 841,573 metric tons of lithium-ion batteries in 2023, mostly
from  China.575  This  constituted  a  32.9  percent  rise  from  2022  and
marked  the  third  straight  year  U.S.  battery  imports  have  risen  by
over 30 percent.576

Utility-scale  batteries  are  increasingly  necessary  to  support  U.S.
energy storage stations, especially as they integrate more power gen-
erated by alternative energy like wind and solar.577 Leading China’s
entrance  into  U.S.  battery  energy  storage  systems  is  Fujian-based
battery  firm  CATL,  whose  battery-backed  energy  storage  systems
are  being  rapidly  installed  into  the  U.S.  electric  grid.578  According
to Craig Singleton, China program director and senior fellow at the
Foundation  for  Defense  of  Democracies,  several  CATL-supported
BESS projects are under construction or have already been complet-

230

ed in the United States, including a March 2022 CATL battery-sup-
ported  BESS  project  in  Florida  and  an  August  2022  project  near
Richmond,  Virginia.579  Nevada-based  firm  Primergy  Solar  entered
into  a  sole  battery  supply  agreement  with  CATL  in  October  2022,
which  is  set  to  be  among  the  largest  solar  and  storage  projects  in
the United States.580

CATL’s  rapid  expansion  in  the  U.S.  electrical  storage  market
comes at a time when energy storage batteries are increasingly key
to the U.S. grid’s function.581 In the second quarter of  2024, energy
companies connected nearly 4 GW * of battery storage to the United
States  grid,  up  87.3  percent  year-on-year  and  bringing  total  capac-
ity  to  23.8  GW.582  CATL  batteries  are  well  positioned  to  underpin
Texas’s  power  grid,  where  battery  storage  makes  up  nearly  60  per-
cent of new energy projects seeking to connect to the grid, far more
than any other energy storage source.583 This battery dependency in
energy  grids  is  only  expected  to  grow. Texas  currently  has  4  GW  of
energy battery storage for its grid; this will rise each of the next two
summers to reach a total of 12–14 GW.584 CATL has major contracts
in Texas, including an agreement with Texas-based HGP Storage to
produce up to 5 GWh † of energy to support the Texas power grid.585
Mr.  Singleton  argues  that  the  integration  of  CATL  batteries  into
the  U.S.  electrical  grid  creates  potential  vulnerabilities  to  hacking,
intelligence gathering, and disruption from China.586 Due to vulner-
abilities  in  EV  charging  networks,  EVs  themselves,  and  BESS-re-
lated  systems,  hardware  manufacturers  could  compromise  EVs,
charging networks, electric grids, and industrial control systems.587
Mr.  Singleton  acknowledges  that “it  is  challenging  to  ascertain  the
precise likelihood of such attacks, [but] the potential exists.” 588 An-
other report from Aon, a cybersecurity advisory firm, similarly iden-
tifies  vulnerabilities  in  BESS  systems,  finding  that  their  operating
systems and components can be out of date and lacking in sophisti-
cated  security  measures.589  Should  these  vulnerabilities  be  exploit-
ed,  they  could  be  deeply  disruptive  to  the  energy  systems  in  which
they  are  embedded.590  In  his  report,  Mr.  Singleton  indicates  that
previous  cyberattacks  have  already  targeted  energy  systems,  such
as a 2022 ransomware attack on India’s Tata Power, one of the coun-
try’s  largest  integrated  power  companies.591  He  warns  that  in  the
worst-case  scenarios,  such  attacks  could  carry  grave  consequences,
including  potential  blackouts  of  critical  industrial  areas  and  major
financial  hubs.592  The  Aon  report  further  identifies  risks  of  lithi-
um-ion  batteries  themselves  that  underpin  BESS  systems.  These
batteries require careful oversight and control for their voltage and
temperature.593  Should  a  threat  actor  interfere,  these  battery  cells
could  rapidly  degrade  or,  in  the  case  of  extreme  interference,  a  re-
mote  attack  could  trigger  a  significant  fire  or  explosion  at  the  site
of  the  BESS  system  with  potentially  broader  consequences  for  the
local  grid,  a  point  echoed  by  Dr.  Jeffrey  Nadaner,  former  Deputy

These battery storage systems are complemented by other Chinese
equipment also being installed in the U.S. power grid. As Joe Weiss
describes in Control, from 2006 through 2023, the United States has
imported  around  450  transformers  over  10,000  kilo-volt-amperes
(kVA)  from  China.595  More  than  360  of  these  Chinese-made  trans-
formers were large transmission systems over 100,000 kVA that are
key to operating the electrical grid.596 Mr. Weiss warns that despite
some  executive  action †  to  limit  foreign  influence  in  the  electrical
grid, U.S. utility firms continue to buy Chinese equipment, including
more  than  125  large  Chinese  transformers  since  2020.597  Chinese
energy storage batteries and related equipment are increasingly in-
stalled in U.S. power networks.

Batteries Linger in U.S. Networks

Despite efforts to remove Chinese batteries from some U.S. critical
networks, such as the U.S. military’s ban on buying Chinese batter-
ies,  Chinese-produced  batteries  remain  critical  parts  of  the  supply
chain  for  the  U.S.  government.598 According  to  Dr.  Nadaner’s  testi-
mony before the Commission, between 2018 and 2023, 1,503 battery
suppliers to U.S. government agencies relied on Chinese components
in  their  supply  chain,  more  than  double  Japan  (462)  and  Germany
(392),  the  second  and  third  leading  component  suppliers.599  Last
year,  Chinese-produced  industrial  batteries  were  unplugged  at
Camp  Lejeune  due  to  congressional  concerns  of  the  potential  risks
these  batteries  posed  to  disrupting  the  military  installation’s  pow-
er  supply  and  energy  infrastructure.600  Experts  claim  that  a  BESS
system such as the one installed at Camp Lejeune requires frequent
remote  operation  and  that  telecommunications  equipment  connect-
ed to the batteries could be vulnerable to hacking attempts.601 Pre-
ceding the batteries’ removal, 27 lawmakers signed a letter warning
that “CATL could introduce malware into large-scale power storage
stations, threatening the U.S. energy grid” and that the presence of
CATL batteries in U.S. military installations and critical infrastruc-
ture  “raise[s]  several  concerns  that  a  malicious  actor,  or  govern-
ment, could seek to exploit.” 602 Mike Casey, director of the National
Counterintelligence  and  Security  Center,  further  warns  against  the
risks  introduced  by  Chinese  battery  storage  systems:  “We  encour-
age  power  companies  interested  in  using  these  industrial  battery
energy  storage  systems  from  China  to  think  beyond  the  short-term
cost  savings  they  may  realize  and  consider  the  potential  long-term
vulnerabilities and how to mitigate them.” 603

* The simultaneous detonation of Hezbollah devices in Lebanon in September 2024 demonstrat-
ed the feasibility of prepositioning in a network and carrying out a coordinated remote sabotage
strike.  Though  the  context  in  which  this  attack  occurred  and  the  tactical  approach  are  unique,
the  event  underscores  the  imperative  to  ensure  remote  backdoor  capabilities  are  not  built  into
battery systems in U.S. networks, given these systems’ inherent explosive quality. Bruce Schneier,

used  in  the  U.S.  electrical  grid  from  entities  controlled  by  a  foreign  adversary  did  not  pose  un-
acceptable  national  security  risk.  The  executive  order  has  since  been  suspended  by  the  Biden

U.S. Efforts to Restrict Chinese EVs

With  greater  U.S.  investments  to  transition  from  carbon-based
energy sources, the Biden Administration is moving to prevent U.S.
firms  from  opting  for  widely  available  Chinese-made  energy  tech-
nology,  particularly  in  the  transportation  sector.  In  December  2023,
the  Administration  explicitly  restricted  Chinese  EV  suppliers  from
receiving tax credits and incentives from the Inflation Reduction Act
by  designating  them  as  a  Foreign  Entity  of  Concern  (FEOC).* 604
The  raft  of  tariff  increases  the  Administration  announced  in  May
2024 brings the rate on Chinese EVs under Section 301 up from 25
percent  to  100  percent  and  on  Chinese  batteries  from  7.5  percent
to  25  percent,  citing  unfair  subsidies  and  rapid  growth  of  Chinese
exports as threatening to U.S. producers.605

Despite  growing  scrutiny,  U.S.  firms  have  maintained  partner-
ships with Chinese battery producers. For example, Ford announced
in February 2023 that it would start producing low-cost lithium-ion
batteries by 2026 at its plant in Michigan using technology licensed
from  CATL.606  This  illustrates  one  of  the  main  challenges  for  U.S.
industries  seeking  to  reduce  reliance  on  Chinese  batteries.  Even  if
the  United  States  reduces  dependencies  on  physical  Chinese  bat-
teries, China continues to dominate battery supply chains and even
research  in  battery  technology,  publishing  about  half  of  the  world’s
research  on  battery  efficiency.607  As  a  result,  Chinese  firms  often
maintain an edge over U.S. competitors in technology, IP, and know-
how in battery manufacturing.608 Ford is therefore in an unenviable
position  of  licensing  state-of-the  art  CATL  technology  and  IP,  even
as  the  Administration  seeks  to  limit  the  reach  of  Chinese  battery
makers  in  the  United  States.609  The  planned  partnership  appears
set  to  proceed  amid  bipartisan  congressional  concerns  and  the  Ad-
ministration’s  new  rules,  which  do  not  directly  prohibit  the  Ford-
CATL agreement.610

Internet of Things (IoT) Raises Growing Concern
There is rising concern of potential security threats to U.S. net-
works  associated  with  Chinese-made  devices.611  In  recent  years,
the  Federal  Communications  Commission  (FCC)  has  placed  ten
Chinese  companies—including  Huawei,  ZTE,  and  Hangzhou
Hikvision  Digital  Technology—on  its  Covered  List  that  prevents
the  marketing,  sale,  or  operation  of  any  equipment  within  the
United  States  due  to  national  security  risks.612  Recent  attention
has focused on cellular modules produced by Chinese companies,
which  connect  IoT †  devices  to  the  internet  that  have  the  poten-
tial  to  be  remotely  accessed  and  controlled  from  China.613  Chi-

* Under the rules set to be implemented over 2024, companies will be denied tax credits if ve-
hicle batteries contain components that were manufactured or assembled by an FEOC. Beginning
in 2025, the rules expand in scope to disqualify any vehicles whose batteries contain any critical
minerals  extracted,  processed,  or  recycled  by  an  FEOC.  U.S.  Department  of  the  Treasury,  Trea-
sury  Releases  Proposed  Guidance  to  Continue  U.S.  Manufacturing  Boom  in  Batteries  and  Clean

na’s government has sustained policies to boost IoT development,
including accelerating IoT research and applications in the State
Council’s “Made in China 2025” plan released in 2015.614 China is
one of the largest producers of IoT equipment globally, with three
Chinese companies, Quectel (37.1 percent), Fibocom (6.9 percent),
and China Mobile (6.8 percent), collectively holding about half of
the  global  market  as  of  the  first  quarter  in  2024.615  In  Septem-
ber 2023, the FCC reportedly raised security concerns about two
Chinese IoT module companies, Fibocom and Quectel, to U.S. gov-
ernment agencies with the relevant authority to consider whether
they pose national security risks.* 616

The  United  States  is  separately  considering  measures  to  address
potential  privacy,  data  security,  and  cyber  security  concerns  associ-
ated with Chinese-made EVs. Similar to the concerns raised by Mr.
Singleton,  independent  cybersecurity  researchers  have  demonstrat-
ed  the  ability  of  Chinese-made  EVs  and  EV  charging  equipment
to  collect  and  transmit  data  back  to  China  and  install  malware.617
In  February  2024,  the  Commerce  Department  issued  an  Advanced
Notice  of  Proposed  Rulemaking  to  address  threats  stemming  from
“connected  vehicles”  from  China.618  On  September  23,  2024,  BIS
released  a  Notice  of  Proposed  Rulemaking  to  address  security  con-
cerns  from  connected  vehicles  that,  if  finalized,  will  prohibit  the
sale  or  import  of  certain  types  of  Chinese  hardware  and  software
integrated into vehicle connectivity systems and automated driving
systems to take effect for model years 2027 and 2030, dependent on
the type of technology.619

Implications for the United States

U.S.-China technology competition is foundational to both U.S.-Chi-
na  economic  competition  and  national  security.  China  has  realized
the importance of technology supremacy for decades and consistent-
ly implemented policies designed to gain an edge in technologies of
the future. If China surpasses the United States in the development
and deployment of these technologies at scale, industries critical for
the United States and its allies could become overly reliant on Chi-
na,  and  the  balance  of  regional  and  global  power  could  shift  in  the
PLA’s favor. The United States has already begun to take aggressive
steps to ensure continued U.S. technological leadership in these sec-
tors through domestic investments, export controls, and investment
restrictions,  and  it  is  considering  other  policies,  but  some  hurdles
remain.

Advanced  computing  technology,  including  AI,  is  at  the  forefront
of U.S.-China technology competition. AI will add tremendous value
to the global economy and reshape a swath of industries. AI also has

* Quectel  refuted  concerns  raised  regarding  the  security  of  its  modules.  In  a  press  release,
Quectel  Wireless  Solutions  stated  that  “Quectel  customers  own  the  data,  and  [Quectel  has]  no
access  to  any  of  the  data  collected.”  Business Wire, “Quectel  Response  to  FCC  about  IoT  Module
Security,”  September  7,  2023;  David  Shepardson, “US  FCC  Chair  Says  China’s  Quectel,  Fibocom

the  potential  to  transform  the  military  balance  between  the  Unit-
ed  States  and  China  by  helping  both  militaries  improve  their  data
analysis,  accelerate  battlefield  decision-making,  and  more  effective-
ly  target  the  adversary.620  One  key  to  AI  competition  is  advanced
semiconductors,  where  the  United  States  has  a  lead  but  China  is
investing heavily to catch up. Separately, there is a risk that China
may flood the world with cheap legacy semiconductors, forcing pric-
es down, which may threaten the viability of other countries’ legacy
semiconductor  industries  and  provide  China  with  significant  global
economic leverage. Another aspect of competition in AI is the quality
and  performance  of  AI  models.  Amid  a  vigorous  debate  within  the
AI  industry  over  whether  open  source  or  closed  source  models  are
the  better  approach,  entities  in  China  have  been  using  U.S.  open
source models as the basis for some of their technological advances.
There  is  not  currently  a  U.S.  policy  framework  that  focuses  on  the
differences  between  the  two  approaches  for  U.S.-China  technology
competition. Moreover, experts have also expressed concern over the
need  to  address  cloud  computing,  a  key  potential  workaround  that
could  allow  Chinese  firms  or  even  the  PLA  itself  to  access  highly
advanced  AI  and  quantum  computing  capabilities  located  in  dif-
ferent  countries  and  delivered  remotely  via  the  cloud.621 While  ex-
isting  controls  on  AI  have  limited  such  access  to  a  certain  extent,
technological change, developments in global markets, and evolving
Chinese policy responses all underscore the importance of regularly
reviewing U.S. export controls and related policies.

While  practical  breakthroughs  from  QIS  are  generally  yet  to  be
realized,  the  potentially  profound  economic  and  national  security
implications of such technologies require close scrutiny. The country
that  has  the  edge  in  quantum  technologies  will  be  able  to  protect
its  communications  networks  from  eavesdropping  and  interception,
break adversaries’ encryption methods, bolster its scientific research,
and  deploy  advanced  sensing  capabilities  to  detect  enemy  military
assets.622  To  date,  the  U.S.  export  control  policy  response  for  QIS
has been limited, at least in part because defense applications have
been  viewed  as  less  achievable  within  the  short  to  medium  term
for most aspects of QIS other than quantum sensing.623 Unlike the
advanced  semiconductor  controls  used  for  AI,  U.S.  quantum  tech-
nology  controls  primarily  only  target  specific  Chinese  end  users  in-
stead of the other enabling technology categories. Questions remain
regarding  the  effectiveness  of  the  end  user  approach,  the  utility  of
broader  controls  on  enabling  technologies  and  access  to  R&D  and
know-how,  and  potential  opportunities  for  multilateral  cooperation
with allies.624

U.S.-China competition in biotechnology will have significant eco-
nomic impacts in terms of capabilities in numerous technologies and
manufacturing  industries  of  the  future,  and  for  some  applications
it  will  have  direct  national  security  implications.  In  addition,  ge-
nomic-related  biotechnologies  raise  concerns  about  data  collection,
including access to sensitive health and genetic data on U.S. citizens
and abuse for surveillance purposes. At the same time, many appli-
cations  of  biotechnology  would  provide  overall  benefits  to  health-
care,  medicine,  and  related  technologies,  and  traditionally,  coopera-
tive scientific research in such fields has been supported. While the

235

United  States  leads  in  many  areas  of  innovation  in  biotechnology,
Chinese  biotechnology  companies  such  as  BGI  and  WuXi  have  be-
come  integral  in  U.S.  genomic  and  pharmaceutical  supply  chains,
raising concerns over dependency for medical and agricultural prod-
ucts.  Furthermore,  these  companies  are  obtaining  advantages  over
time  due  to  their  access  to  sensitive  data  and  proprietary  commer-
cial  information,  an  area  of  particular  concern  given  their  alleged
ties to the PLA.

Finally,  the  rapid  expansion  and  dominant  position  China  has
attained  in  the  global  battery  industry  presents  an  expansive
challenge  for  policymakers  in  an  emerging  technology  with  major
implications  for  the  transition  to  clean  and  renewable  energy  sys-
tems.  With  China’s  overwhelming  presence  throughout  the  battery
production supply chain, Chinese companies are poised to maintain
substantial advantages and market share for powering clean energy
technologies that rely on batteries, likely requiring U.S. manufactur-
ers to rely on suppliers and IP from China at least for the short and
medium  term.625  Moreover,  the  proliferation  of  Chinese  batteries
within U.S. networks, including vital energy infrastructures, creates
cyber  security-related  concerns,  vulnerabilities  to  remote  manipu-
lation,  and  sabotage.  Experts  indicate  that  Chinese-made  batteries
heighten  the  risk  of  espionage  or  unforeseen  energy  supply  disrup-
tions  and  system  failures  as  they  become  further  integrated  into
critical  U.S.  operations.626  Recent  U.S.  policies  have  taken  limited
steps to address these challenges, specifically provisions in the Infla-
tion Reduction Act incentivizing domestic production of clean energy
vehicles and the recent Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to
study risks from connected vehicles and associated systems.

CHAPTER 4: UNSAFE AND UNREGULATED
CHINESE CONSUMER GOODS: CHALLENGES IN
ENFORCING IMPORT REGULATIONS
AND LAWS

Abstract

The  rapid  escalation  of  e-commerce  sales  impedes  U.S.  efforts
to  ensure  the  safety  and  regulatory  compliance  of  consumer
products  flooding  the  market  from  China.  These  new  channels,
combined with China’s reinvigorated focus on export manufactur-
ing  as  a  pillar  of  economic  growth,  mean  that  Chinese  factories
will  remain  major  suppliers  across  the  consumer  products  space.
Though  the  quality  of  goods  sourced  from  China  has  improved
somewhat over the past two decades as a result of increased due
diligence  and  monitoring  on  the  factory  floor,  significant  excep-
tions remain, and overall product quality and safety still fall short
of U.S. standards. Many Chinese companies that disregard manu-
facturing best practices utilize cross-border e-commerce channels
to  send  products  directly  to  consumers  under  a  de  minimis  ex-
emption that provides duty-free entry for small parcel shipments.
A  continually  rising  flood  of  small  parcels  at  U.S.  ports  of  entry
compounds  the  difficulty  of  detecting  potentially  risky  products
before they reach households and children. Holding Chinese man-
ufacturers and exporters accountable remains challenging—if not
virtually  impossible—under  the  Xi  regime.  Moreover,  China  is
home  to  the  world’s  largest  counterfeiting  industry,  harming  not
only U.S. businesses but also consumers who face increased safe-
ty risks from shoddily made imitations. Accurate data on consum-
er  product  imports  are  crucial  to  enforcement,  but  an  increased
number  of  Chinese  exporters  are  seeking  to  exploit  loopholes  in
U.S.  law  and  disguise  the  nature  and/or  origins  of  their  imports
to  dodge  higher  tariffs  on  products  from  China.

Key Findings

 • China  aims  to  continue  growing  its  manufacturing  sector,
leading  to  further  industrial  overcapacity  and  a  surge  in  ex-
ports.  Chinese  manufacturers  have,  in  general,  improved  in
quality  and  reliability  over  the  past  decade,  owing  in  part
to  increased  enforcement  by  Chinese  authorities  domesti-
cally  and  increased  due  diligence  by  foreign  firms.  Howev-
er,  the  scale  and  dynamism  of  China’s  manufacturing  sector
means  regulators  in  the  United  States  struggle  to  respond
to  emergent  product  safety  issues.  New  online  platforms  and
the multitude of third-party e-commerce sellers and resellers
compound  these  issues.

(271)

272

 • U.S.  regulators  are  overwhelmed  by  the  volume  of  imports  ar-
riving  from  China,  and  they  are  only  able  to  inspect  a  small
fraction of imports, potentially leaving large numbers of unsafe
or illegal goods to enter the U.S. market daily.

 • Unscrupulous  China-based  sellers  lack  the  diligence,  capacity,
and skill required to produce high-quality goods that meet U.S.
safety  regulations,  thus  increasing  U.S.  consumers’  exposure  to
risks stemming from unsafe, counterfeit, and poor-quality goods
from  China.  These  deceptive  tactics  by  Chinese  producers  are
particularly concerning in industries such as batteries and med-
ical  products,  where  defective  products  pose  potentially  debili-
tating or deadly consequences.

 • U.S. import regulators face significant challenges in monitoring
the  growing  volume  of  Chinese  e-commerce  shipments  specifi-
cally,  which  typically  enter  under  a  de  minimis  exemption  that
provides  duty-free  treatment  for  parcels  valued  under  $800.
The  growth  of  smaller,  China-based  sellers  on  U.S.  e-commerce
sites and the rising popularity of Chinese e-commerce platforms
present  a  novel  and  growing  risk  to  U.S.  consumers  and  the
ability to enforce safety regulations and other laws. Insufficient
data,  personnel,  and  overwhelming  volume  mean  these  ship-
ments receive less scrutiny.

 • Some  Chinese  companies  have  tried  to  circumvent  normal  U.S.
customs  channels  in  response  to  tariffs  and  other  U.S.  laws.
Though the true scale of customs fraud is unknowable, some ac-
tors are using illegal tactics such as transshipment, circumven-
tion, and import undervaluation to evade paying customs duties.
These tactics worsen the information available to U.S. agencies,
increasing the challenge of identifying hazardous imports.

Recommendations
The Commission recommends:

 • With  respect  to  imports  sold  through  an  online  marketplace,
Congress  eliminate  Section  321  of  the  Tariff  Act  of  1930  (also
known as the “de minimis” exemption), which allows goods val-
ued  under  $800  to  enter  the  United  States  duty  free  and,  for
all  practical  purposes,  with  less  rigorous  regulatory  inspection.
Congress  should  provide  U.S.  Customs  and  Border  Protection
adequate  resources,  including  staff  and  technology,  for  imple-
mentation, monitoring, and enforcement.

 • Congress  amend  the  Consumer  Product  Safety Act  to  (1)  grant
the  U.S.  Consumer  Product  Safety  Commission  (CPSC)  unilat-
eral  mandatory  recall  authority  over  products  where  the  Chi-
nese  seller  is  unresponsive  to  requests  from  the  CPSC  for  fur-
ther information or to initiate a voluntary recall and the CPSC
has  evidence  of  a  substantial  product  hazard,  defined  as  either
failing  to  comply  with  any  CPSC  rule,  regulation,  standard,  or
ban or posing a substantial risk of injury to the public; and (2)
classify  Chinese  e-commerce  platforms  as  distributors  to  allow
for  enforcement  of  recalls  and  other  safety  standards  for  prod-
ucts sold on these platforms.

273

 • Congress  direct  the  U.S.  Department  of  Homeland  Security
and U.S. Customs and Border Protection, in conjunction with
the  U.S.  Department  of  Commerce,  to  develop  assessment
tools  capable  of  identifying  the  true  origins  of  parts,  com-
ponents,  and  materials  contained  in  products  entering  the
United  States  to  prevent  tariff  evasion  and  limit  safety  and
security  risks  in  light  of  the  increasing  complexity  of  global
supply  chains.

 • Congress require that the U.S. Trade Representative, in consul-
tation  with  the  U.S.  Department  of  Commerce,  the  U.S.  Inter-
national Trade  Commission,  and  other  entities,  as  appropriate,
prepare a comprehensive report within 90 days on the operation
of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement since its entry into
force that provides data and information on:
 ○ Chinese-affiliated investments in Mexico and Canada and spe-
cific  information  on  their  production  of  goods  and  how  those
goods  may  enter  the  U.S.  market  either  as  finished  products
or as components in other products;

 ○ Trade  flows  of  products  produced  in  China  to  Mexico  and

Canada and how such trade flows have changed;

 ○ Prices  of  products  produced  in  China  shipped  to  Mexico  and
Canada  as  well  as  products  shipped  through  those  countries
to the United States and how those prices relate to the prices
of such goods shipped directly into the U.S. market; and

 ○ Trade  enforcement  actions  by  Mexico  and  Canada  regard-
ing Chinese-produced products (including those transshipped
through third countries’ markets) and how such actions relate
to U.S. trade enforcement actions.

 • Congress  amend  applicable  laws  to  mandate  that  online  mar-
ketplaces  clearly  disclose  on  product  listings  for  Chinese-made
goods  the  name,  physical  address,  and  contact  information  for
the  manufacturer.  The  online  marketplaces  should  also  be  re-
quired to clearly display a warning label that the item is man-
ufactured in a country that does not comply with U.S. consumer
safety standards.

 • Congress  direct  the  U.S.  Government  Accountability  Office  to
investigate the reliability of safety testing certifications for con-
sumer products and medical devices imported from China.

Introduction

According  to  data  provided  by  the  U.S.  Census  Bureau,  the  Unit-
ed  States  imported  $426.9  billion  in  goods  from  China  in  2023,  al-
though this undercounts e-commerce sales.1 Everything from water
heaters  to  consumer  electronic  products  to  pool  drain  covers  and
children’s toys are made in factories across China and then shipped
into  the  U.S.  market.  In  most  cases,  these  Chinese-made  products
present  minimal  to  no  health  and  safety  risks  to  U.S.  consumers,
in  part  due  to  efforts  by  U.S.-based  importers  and  retailers  to  vet
and  monitor  the  quality  of  manufacturing  taking  place  in  China.
However,  changing  consumption  patterns  and  marketing  and  sell-

274

ing  strategies  by  Chinese  firms  are  increasingly  exposing  U.S.  con-
sumers  to  poorly  made  and  poorly  regulated  goods  from  China.  A
large and increasing portion  of imports from China comes  from on-
line  shopping—and  specifically  by  the  purchase  of  consumer  goods
through e-commerce platforms with direct delivery to homes. These
platforms directly connect U.S. consumers to China-based manufac-
turers  that  often  lack  the  diligence,  capacity,  and  skill  required  to
produce high-quality goods that meet U.S. safety regulations. More-
over, since these firms are based in China, they generally lie outside
the  reach  of  U.S.  regulators,  courts,  and  law  enforcement  agencies.
They  are  therefore  able  to  sell  unsafe  goods  directly  into  the  U.S.
market  and  are  unlikely  to  ever  be  held  accountable  for  the  harm
these  products  cause.  These  problems  are  further  compounded  by
the  limited  capacity  to  monitor  the  millions  of  small  parcels  that
enter the U.S. market duty free each day under a de minimis exemp-
tion.* As a result, billions of dollars of potentially unsafe, hazardous,
and even deadly goods are shipped from China directly to the door-
steps of U.S. homes every year, presenting a risk to U.S. consumers
and firms alike.

U.S.  information  on  imports  from  China  is  hampered  by  illegal
and duplicitous behavior by some Chinese exporters. Billions of dol-
lars’ worth of counterfeit goods from China are seized each year by
U.S. customs authorities, although this is likely just a fraction of the
knockoff  goods  sold  into  the  U.S.  market.  In  addition  to  infringing
on intellectual property rights (IPR) and causing financial and repu-
tational harm to U.S. businesses, Chinese counterfeits may lack the
safety features and materials of legitimate products, posing hazards
to  U.S.  consumers  from  toxic  materials  and  other  risks.  Parallel  to
this behavior, an increased number of exporters are seeking to avoid
or  evade  U.S.  customs  duties.  Recent  U.S.  trade  actions  taken  since
2018  resulted  in  increased  tariffs  on  two-thirds  of  goods  entering
the  U.S.  market  from  China,  creating  an  increased  financial  incen-
tive  to  game  the  U.S.  import  process  and  mitigate  tariff  burdens.
Though  the  true  scale  of  illegal  behavior  is  unknowable,  anecdotal
evidence suggests a rising number of companies are employing tac-
tics like transshipment, circumvention, and evasion to avoid tariffs,
amplifying the challenges facing U.S. customs officials.

This  chapter  begins  with  an  overview  of  the  challenges  in  assur-
ing the quality of China-based producers, which are amplified by the
scale  of  China’s  manufacturing  sector  as  well  as  challenges  in  en-
suring the quality of goods from China-based producers. The chapter
considers the difficulties of enforcing tariffs and regulations on Chi-
nese  imports  at  the  border  and  the  tactics  used  to  evade  detection.
The  chapter  then  examines  the  safety  and  reliability  of  goods  from
China and considers the challenges U.S. regulators face in monitor-

* On September 13, 2024, the Biden Administration announced that it intended to release two
Notices  of  Proposed  Rulemaking  that  would  modify  the  de  minimis  exemption.  These  include
rules  that  would  make  goods  subject  to  tariffs  under  Section  232  of  the Trade  Expansion Act  of
1962  as  well  as  Section  201  and  Section  301  of  the Trade Act  of  1974  ineligible  for  de  minimis
entry and expand the information required on de minimis customs invoices. The Biden Adminis-
tration also announced that the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission plans to propose a fi-
nal rule that requires all importers of consumer products to electronically file product certificates,

ing  imports  from  China. This  portion  also  pays  special  attention  to
the  impact  e-commerce  has  on  consumer  product  safety  and  U.S.
regulators’  burdens.  This  chapter  draws  on  the  Commission’s  2024
hearing  on  “Consumer  Products  from  China:  Safety,  Regulations,
and  Supply  Chains,”  consultations  with  policy  experts,  and  open
source research and analysis.

U.S. Consumer Product Sourcing from China

The  sheer  volume  of  products  entering  from  China  poses  a  fun-
damental  challenge  to  the  effective  enforcement  of  U.S.  laws,  reg-
ulations,  and  trade  measures.  This  issue  is  especially  acute  in  the
consumer products sector, which constitutes roughly half of China’s
exports  to  the  United  States.2  China  is  the  largest  source  of  con-
sumer  goods  for  the  United  States,  accounting  for  over  25  percent
of U.S. consumer product imports in 2023.3 This total, amounting to
$210.2  billion,  exceeded  the  combined  value  of  consumer  products
sourced from the United States’ next four largest trading partners.4
Chinese  producers  likely  have  an  even  larger  role  in  the  consumer
products space than these data indicate, as they undercount e-com-
merce  shipments  and  also  do  not  reflect  China’s  expanding  role  as
a  supplier  of  manufacturing  inputs.  China’s  export  manufacturing
capacity  will  likely  expand  further  as  China’s  government  focuses
on  export  manufacturing  as  a  pillar  of  economic  growth  amid  the
economy’s slowdown. (For more, see Chapter 1, “U.S.-China Econom-
ic  and  Trade  Relations  (Year  in  Review).”)  As  a  consequence,  the
manufacturing  practices  and  standards  of  Chinese  manufacturers
will  continue  to  have  an  outsized  impact  on  the  safety  and  quality
of goods for sale in the U.S. market.

In addition to this overwhelming volume of goods, U.S. regulators
are also sifting through a growing number of factories in China that
are  sending  goods  into  the  U.S.  market.  The  number  of  companies
in  China  involved  in  its  traded  goods  sector  grew  29  percent  be-
tween 2019 and 2023, with over 645,000 businesses in China under-
taking  either  import  or  export  activities  by  the  end  of  2023.5  This
growth  was  partly  driven  by  an  acceleration  in  direct-to-consumer
e-commerce trade, which expanded during the COVID-19 pandemic
as  quarantine  measures  pushed  consumers  to  rely  more  on  online
channels  for  shopping.6  According  to  China’s  customs  agency,  total
e-commerce  exports  have  grown  from  $92  billion  in  2018  to  $262
billion in 2023, increasing 36 percent on average each year.7 E-com-
merce trade now accounts for 7.7 percent of China’s overall exports.8
In 2023, China reported that more than 100,000 different companies
participated  in  cross-border  e-commerce  transactions.9  The  United
States is the largest export market for China-based e-commerce sell-
ers.10  Chinese  e-commerce  firms  sent  $97.9  billion  in  goods  to  the
United  States  in  2023,  equivalent  to  nearly  20  percent  of  China’s
total  U.S.-bound  exports,  according  to  China’s  customs  agency.* 11

* The United States does not produce an official estimate on imports that were sold through an
e-commerce  platform.  Many,  but  not  all,  e-commerce  shipments  enter  under  the  United  States’
de  minimis  exemption,  which  provides  duty-free  treatment  for  parcels  valued  under  $800.  U.S.
Customs and Border Protection reports that de minimis imports from China totaled $10.4 billion
in  fiscal  year  2021  (the  most  recent  year  showing  shipments  by  country),  but  this  estimate  may
be  unreliable  due  to  the  difficulty  in  recording  and  verifying  the  value  of  individual  parcels.

The growth in firms selling directly to U.S. consumers poses a chal-
lenge  for  U.S.  regulators  in  monitoring  imports,  enforcing  U.S.  reg-
ulations,  and  identifying  bad  actors.*  Additionally,  U.S.  businesses
that  source  products  from  China-based  manufacturers  continue  to
encounter difficulties due to unscrupulous tactics employed by some
Chinese manufacturers.

Challenges in Ensuring the Quality of China-Based Producers
Many  foreign  firms  hire  quality  control  (QC)  inspectors  in  China
to  ensure  Chinese  manufacturers  meet  global  standards;  however,
corruption  and  gamesmanship  frequently  undermine  the  integri-
ty  of  these  inspections.  Corruption  in  the  QC  inspection  process  is
a  common  issue  facing  foreign  firms  seeking  to  produce  in  China.
Some  Chinese  factory  owners  attempt  to  influence  QC  inspectors
through  a  variety  of  means,  from  overt  cash  offers  to  more  subtle
forms  of  compensation  like  free  entertainment.12  In  addition,  QC
inspectors  themselves  may  seek  to  extort  suppliers  by  threatening
to  submit  an  unfavorable  report  unless  the  supplier  offers  compen-
sation.13  Attempted  and  realized  extortion  by  both  inspectors  and
suppliers  adds  uncertainty  to  U.S.  firms’  assessments  of  Chinese
manufacturers’  production  quality.  U.S.  firms  looking  to  conduct
regular  QC  inspections  in  China  must  therefore  carefully  vet  and
rotate  inspectors  to  avoid  this  risk,  a  process  that  adds  time  and
cost  to  production.14  In  addition,  there  is  a  cottage  industry  of  con-
sultants  in  China  helping  factories  pass  inspections  by  any  means
necessary.  In  2021,  the  South  China  Morning  Post  investigated
these  consultants  by  placing  an  ad  for  a  fictitious  factory  looking
for  help  selling  to  European  buyers.15  One  Shanghai-based  consul-
tant responded to the ad by saying, “As long as you cooperate, keep
the  troublemakers  out  of  the  factory  on  inspection  day,  and  make
sure  workers  follow  our  guidance  on  answering  questions,  we  will
guarantee  you  pass.” 16  Beyond  coaching  employees,  these  consul-
tants can provide forged records and time cards and can even bring
auditors to a “show factory”—a different plant that is more aligned
with “Western” production standards.17

Even  when  a  U.S.  firm  believes  it  has  found  a  quality  manufac-
turer,  it  can  be  difficult  to  ensure  that  Chinese  producers  continue
to adhere to contractually agreed-upon standards. Some foreign pur-
chasers  experience  quality  fade,  a  phenomenon  where  a  manufac-
turer begins cutting corners to reduce costs and increase profits, re-
sulting  in  decreased  product  quality. AsiaInspection,†  a  third-party
QC service, analyzed data on thousands of in-factory quality checks
from  2018  and  found  that  26  percent  of  made-in-China  products
were manufactured outside of quality specifications.18 In addition to
variance in product quality, U.S. purchasers reportedly face the risk

of  their  Chinese  manufacturers  suddenly  going  out  of  business.19
Chinese  producers—particularly  those  operating  in  low-tech,  la-
bor-intensive industries like textiles, clothing, shoes, and toys—face
rising  competition  from  other  countries  with  low-wage  manufactur-
ing, like Vietnam.20 As Dan Harris, founder of the international law
firm  Harris  Sliwoski,  observes,  some  Chinese  manufacturers  have
suddenly gone out of business without informing their U.S. purchas-
er,  leaving  the  U.S.  firm  without  a  supplier  and  sometimes  without
the product they purchased.21 The number of bankruptcies in China
has risen since 2016, when the Party-state launched a deleveraging
campaign to curtail lending from the “shadow” or informal banking
system.* According to aggregated statistics provided by China’s Su-
preme People’s Court, the number of bankruptcy filings accepted in
Chinese courts increased from roughly 5,000 filings in 2016 to more
than 15,000 in 2021.† 22

U.S.  firms’  ability  to  seek  relief  for  unsatisfactory  production  is
further  undermined  by  the  China  Export  &  Credit  Insurance  Cor-
poration,  or  Sinosure,  which  appears  to  engage  in  extorting  foreign
firms.23  Sinosure  is  China’s  only  state-owned  policy-oriented  credit
insurer,  and  as  a  result,  it  enjoys  a  strong  position  in  the  export
credit insurance market.24 Sinosure facilitates trade with China by
providing  insurance  to  Chinese  manufacturers  that  sell  to  foreign
purchasers  on  credit;  if  a  foreign  purchaser  defaults  on  payment,
Sinosure  will  compensate  the  Chinese  manufacturer.25  However,
according  to  Mr.  Harris,  issues  with  this  system  arise  when  Chi-
nese  manufacturers  deliver  poor-quality  or  hazardous  goods  and
the  foreign  purchaser  refuses  to  pay  the  balance  owed  or  requests
new  products.  The  Chinese  manufacturer  contacts  Sinosure,  which
then demands payment from the foreign purchaser on behalf of the
manufacturer,  threatening  to  sue  the  purchaser  in  either  China
or  their  home  country.  Mr.  Harris  testified  before  the  Commission
that  in  some  cases,  Sinosure  will  put  the  foreign  purchaser  on  a
blacklist  and  refuse  to  provide  insurance  to  Chinese  manufactur-
ers  seeking  to  supply  to  that  purchaser.26  The  foreign  purchaser
must then either pay for all its products in full up front and accept
greater  risk  of  being  defrauded  by  the  manufacturer  or  else  effec-
tively  be  banned  from  purchasing  Chinese  exports.  Left  with  few
options,  many  foreign  purchasers  end  up  paying  for  the  defective
and sometimes even undelivered products.27 Mr. Harris argues that
Sinosure’s  aggressive  approach  to  repayment  effectively  subsidizes
low-quality  Chinese  manufacturers.28  Meanwhile,  U.S.  businesses

* Shadow  banking  refers  to  banking  services  that  are  provided  by  non-bank  financial  institu-
tions  outside  of  the  regulatory  structure  of  the  formal  banking  system.  China’s  shadow  banking
sector ballooned after 2009 as banks channeled funds to off-balance-sheet entities to circumvent
restrictions on credit growth, and informal or non-bank lending accounted for 31 percent of total
credit  growth  between  2012  and  2016. As  China  started  to  regulate  these  channels  and  tighten
access to credit after 2016, many borrowers from shadow banks were suddenly cut off from new
credit,  and  rising  default  rates  forced  China’s  banking  system  to  absorb  a  growing  volume  of
non-performing  assets. This  had  the  effect  of  raising  borrowing  costs  economy-wide  and  squeez-
ing  non-state  firms’  access  to  new  credit  as  banks  sought  to  avoid  taking  on  new  credit  risk  by
charging  higher  interest  rates. This  impacted  businesses’  capacity  to  refinance  or  roll  over  debt,
contributing to rising defaults. Logan Wright, “Grasping Shadows: The Politics of China’s Delever-
aging Campaign,” Center for Strategic and International Studies, April 2023.

† Chinese bankruptcy data understate the number of defunct companies, as many smaller com-
panies  choose  to  settle  with  creditors  outside  of  court.  China  has  established  new  specialized
bankruptcy  courts  across  China  since  2019  in  an  effort  to  improve  the  bankruptcy  process  and
reduce delays and other frictions in bankruptcy proceedings. Bo Li and Jacopo Ponticelli, “Going
Bankrupt in China,” Review of Finance 26:3 (2022): 456–458, 466.

Challenges to Tariff Enforcement at the Border

The China Section 301 tariff actions are unprecedented in the re-
cent history of U.S. trade policy. The United States has not previous-
ly  raised  import  duties  on  such  a  large  volume  of  imports  sourced
from a single country. Since 2018, U.S. Customs and Border Protec-
tion  (CBP)  has  assessed  $231  billion  in  Section  301  duties  on  im-
ports from China, roughly equivalent to $39 billion per year.30 This
exceeds the $35 billion in duties collected by CBP in fiscal year (FY)
2017 from all countries across all trade duties and remedies.31 These
duties  created  a  significant  financial  incentive  for  firms  to  reduce
their  tariff  burden,  including  through  legal  offramps  from  paying
import  duties  and  through  tactics  to  evade  tariffs  illegally.  Firms’
attempts to utilize exceptions and exploit gaps in tariff enforcement
have created acute challenges for U.S. customs authorities.

Chinese Exporters Use Small Parcel Shipments to Avoid U.S.

Import Duties

Since  2017,  cross-border  e-commerce  trade  between  the  United
States  and  China  has  surged  as  Chinese  exporters  take  advantage
of  the  de  minimis  customs  exemption  to  avoid  Section  301  tariffs
and  other  import  duties,  violating  the  original  intent  of  the  law.†
The  de  minimis  rule  is  a  provision  in  U.S.  law  that  authorizes  the
customs  authority  to  waive  most  import  duties  on  shipments  im-
ported by “one person on one day,” provided that the combined value
of  the  shipments  is  less  than  $800.32  In  contrast,  China’s  own  de
minimis  threshold  is  less  than  $10.33  (For  more,  see  Appendix  I,
“United  States’ Top  15 Trading  Partners’  De  Minimis Thresholds.”)
Between  FY  2018  and  FY  2023,  the  annual  volume  of  de  minimis
imports  from  all  countries  more  than  doubled  to  reach  one  billion
small  parcels  (see  Figure  1).34  By  comparison,  the  number  of  ship-
ments  entering  the  U.S.  market  through  formal  customs  channels,
which excludes de minimis entries but includes containers offloaded
at  ports,  increased  only  4.9  percent  from  35  million  in  FY  2018  to
36.7  million  in  FY  2023.‡ 35  The  volume  of  de  minimis  shipments
has continued to grow disproportionately, with an average of nearly

† The  de  minimis  exemption  was  introduced  in  1938  as  an  amendment  to  the  Tariff  Act  of
1930. The exemption was intended to exempt low-value shipments from standard customs proce-
dures, where the administrative costs of collecting tariffs would otherwise outweigh the revenue
generated.  The  threshold  was  initially  set  at  $5  for  bona  fide  gifts  and  souvenirs  and  other
items acquired abroad by travelers and $1 for all other cases, including commercial merchandise.
Congress  raised  the  latter  threshold  to  $5  in  1978  before  increasing  it  to  $200  in  the  Customs
Modernization Act of 1994. It was raised to the current level of $800 in the Trade Facilitation and
Trade  Enforcement Act  of  2015,  which  was  aimed  at  facilitating  cross-border  e-commerce  trade
for  small  foreign  sellers  on  platforms  such  as  eBay.  Charles  Benoit,  “ ‘De  Minimis’  in  Customs

‡ An  importer  is  required  to  file  an  entry  summary  to  enter  merchandise  into  U.S.  commerce,
which CBP uses to assess whether the cargo is admissible and determine the duties owed. Gen-
erally,  an  importer  can  either  file  a  formal  entry  or,  if  the  merchandise  is  valued  under  $2,500,
file  an  informal  entry  and  make  use  of  simplified  customs  procedures.  Shipments  valued  under
$800  may  be  eligible  for  de  minimis  entry,  and  importers  do  not  need  to  file  entry  summaries.

four million de minimis shipments entering the United States each
day  between  October  2023  and  June  2024.36  The  majority  of  these
packages  were  likely  imported  from  China.  In  FY  2021—the  most
recent  period  for  which  CBP  has  produced  country-level  data—im-
ports  from  China  accounted  for  58  percent  of  the  total  771  million
de minimis entries.37

(FY 2018–FY 2023)

Note: CBP has only published data on China’s share of de minimis imports up to FY 2021. The
projection  for  Chinese  shipments  after  FY  2022,  shown  by  the  dotted  line  segment,  is  based  on
the  ratio  of  Chinese  de  minimis  packages  to  total  de  minimis  imports  in  FY  2021.  Given  the
rapid  growth  of  Chinese  e-commerce  platforms  Shein  and Temu  in  recent  years,  using  FY  2021
as a baseline likely underestimates the current volume of de minimis shipments from China.

The  surge  in  de  minimis  imports  coincided  with  both  an  expan-
sion in U.S. e-commerce consumption during the COVID-19 pandem-
ic and the imposition of the China Section 301 duties. This suggests
some Chinese firms utilized direct-to-consumer e-commerce channels
to avoid paying higher tariffs. Products targeted by most U.S. trade
remedies, including Section 301 tariffs, remain eligible for duty-free
treatment  under  the  de  minimis  exemption,  provided  shipments
meet  the  $800  value  threshold.38  Products  subject  to  an  antidump-
ing and countervailing duty (AD/CVD) order, though, are not eligible
for de minimis entry.39 Chinese companies in sectors heavily target-
ed by U.S. Section 301 duties have utilized e-commerce channels to
avoid  paying  duties.  The  apparel  sector  is  illustrative.  The  Section
301  tariff  actions  applied  a  7.5  percent  tariff  to  90  percent  of  U.S.
apparel  imports  from  China  (relative  to  2017  import  levels).40  The

Chinese  fast-fashion  company  Shein  has  since  developed  expansive
logistics operations based on using small parcel shipments that fall
below  the  de  minimis  threshold.41  Along  with  the  Chinese  e-com-
merce platform Temu, these companies are estimated to account for
over  half  of  all  de  minimis  shipments  from  China.42  In  total,  one
study estimates that as a result of de  minimis imports, $7.8 billion
in  duties  were  avoided  in  2021,  equivalent  to  9.2  percent  of  total
duties collected that year.43

The  de  minimis  exemption  also  allows  Chinese  exporters  to  use
fulfillment centers and warehouses in Mexico and Canada to “wash”
bulk shipments of tariffs. CBP evaluates the “one person on one day”
condition  at  the  time  of  importation  to  the  United  States,  meaning
Chinese  exporters  can  place  goods  in  a  bonded  warehouse  across
the  U.S.  border  until  it  makes  a  sale  through  a  direct-to-consumer
e-commerce  channel.* 44  This  enables  exporters  to  use  ocean-borne
shipping to transport Chinese products in bulk to bonded warehous-
es  located  in  Canada  or  Mexico  before  breaking  the  containerized
shipment into individual parcels that fall below the U.S. de minimis
threshold.† 45  Though  CBP  has  not  published  data  on  the  volume
of  Chinese  de  minimis  packages  entering  indirectly  through  bor-
der  warehousing,  data  on  truck-borne  de  minimis  imports  suggest
a  growing  number  of  firms  are  taking  advantage  of  such  schemes.
Between  FY  2020  and  FY  2023,  de  minimis  packages  carried  by
truck  into  the  United  States  grew  from  97  million  to  170  million
and  now  make  up  nearly  20  percent  of  all  de  minimis  bills  of  lad-
ing.46 Although  Canadian  and  Mexican  products  likely  constitute  a
significant portion of these imports given these producers’ proximity
to  the  U.S.  border,  the  volume  of  de  minimis  packages  that  enter
via  overland  routes  still  exceeds  the  combined  number  of  parcels
sourced from these two U.S. neighbors.‡ Instead, tens of millions of
these  packages  were  likely  sourced  from  other  overseas  countries
utilizing warehousing schemes.47

CBP  has  the  authority  to  adjust  the  de  minimis  exemption  with-
out  additional  legislation.  The  statute  underlying  the  de  minimis
exemption—Section  321  of  the  Tariff  Act  of  1930—authorizes  CBP
to  waive  duties  on  shipments  valued  under  $800,  but  it  can  also
create rules to deny de minimis treatment when it “is necessary for
any  reason  to  protect  the  revenue  or  to  prevent  unlawful  importa-
tions.” 48  Elizabeth  Drake,  partner  at  Schagrin  Associates,  testified
before the Commission that CBP “already has the discretion to deny

* Bulk  shipments  sent  directly  to  a  U.S.-based  bonded  warehouse  or  free  trade  zone  are  not
eligible for the de minimis exemption, as the receiving entity is considered the importer of record

† Importers  can  even  use  U.S.  ports  of  entry  to  receive  ocean-borne  freight  as  part  of  these
schemes  to  utilize  the  de  minimis  exemption.  For  example,  some  third-party  logistics  providers

containers  in-bond  across  the  border  to  fulfillment  centers  in Tijuana,  Mexico.  Economist, “How

Chinese Fentanyl Traffickers Exploit the De Minimis
Rule to Skirt Detection

Chinese  chemical  manufacturers  have  exploited  e-commerce
channels,  including  international  mail  and  express  consignment
operations,  to  route  fentanyl  and  fentanyl-related  substances
(such  as  precursors)  into  the  United  States,  contributing  to  the
U.S. opioid crisis. Direct shipments of fentanyl from Chinese drug
makers  to  U.S.  doorsteps  had  risen  up  until  2019,  when  China
“scheduled” the entire class of fentanyl-type drugs—meaning the
production  and  export  of  these  drugs  is  banned  without  special
government  permits—significantly  reducing  the  flow  of  finished
drugs.51  At  the  time,  however,  China  scheduled  just  two  of  the
numerous  precursor  chemicals  used  to  synthesize  fentanyl,*  and
Chinese  entities  subsequently  shifted  to  supply  North  Ameri-
ca-based  drug  traffickers  with  other  fentanyl  inputs.52  China  is
now the primary supplier of chemicals and  materials for synthe-
sizing  fentanyl  to  Mexican  cartels  and  other  criminal  groups  op-
erating in the United States.53

De minimis shipments serve as a key vector linking these sup-
ply chains as Chinese entities exploit the less stringent reporting
requirements  and  minimal  likelihood  of  inspection.†  Some  Mexi-
co-based criminal groups have found it easier to first ship fentan-
yl  materials  to  the  United  States  under  de  minimis  provisions,
smuggle  them  across  the  border  for  further  processing,  and  then
send the drug back into the United States.54 These chemicals are
widely  and  easily  available  on  Chinese  e-commerce  storefronts.
In  2024,  a  team  of  Reuters  reporters  was  able  to  procure  all  the
chemicals needed to produce fentanyl by placing orders with Chi-
nese online sellers, some of whom provided recipes for synthesiz-
ing  fentanyl  from  their  products.55  Moreover,  unlike  many  other

* Fentanyl  can  be  synthesized  directly  from  a  wide  range  of  chemicals,  called  precursors.  Drug
makers also make use of pre-precursors to produce precursors for fentanyl manufacturing. The Inter-
national Narcotics Control Board has identified 153 fentanyl-related substances that currently have
no  other  legitimate  uses.  Ricardo  Barrios,  Susan V.  Lawrence,  and  Liana W.  Rosen, “China  Primer:

† Given  the  overwhelming  volume  of  small  parcels  entering  the  United  States,  U.S.  regulators
rely  on  advanced  electronic  data,  automated  screening,  and  other  data  sources  to  identify  ship-
ments  that  may  contain  opioids  or  other  illegal  goods.  However,  CBP  states  that  it  cleared  over
685  million  de  minimis  shipments  with  insufficient  data  to  properly  determine  risk  in  FY  2022.
In addition, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security Office of the Inspector General concluded
in  2023  that  “CBP  did  not  consistently  target  for  additional  inspection  or  evaluate  potentially
inadmissible  international  mail  entering  the  United  States  through  its  nine  [international  mail
facilities],”  and  it  has  not  fully  implemented  requirements  to  utilize  advanced  electronic  data

Chinese Fentanyl Traffickers Exploit the De Minimis
Rule to Skirt Detection—Continued
illegal  drugs,  large-scale  production  of  fentanyl  does  not  depend
on  industrial-scale  supplies  of  chemicals,  and  small  parcel  ship-
ments  of  inputs  can  yield  large  quantities  of  the  product.  Just
one kilo of the precursor 1-boc-4 piperidone is enough to produce
750,000  fentanyl  tablets.56  Economists  Timothy  J.  Moore,  Wil-
liam  W.  Olney,  and  Benjamin  Hansen  link  increased  state-lev-
el  imports  to  a  rise  in  opioid  deaths,  estimating  that  fentanyl
smuggled  through  legal  customs  channels  killed  approximately
14,000–20,000 Americans  per  year,  accounting  for  30–40  percent
of all opioid deaths between 2017 and 2020.* 57

Though  China  has  taken  recent  steps  to  curb  the  flow  of  fentan-
yl-related material, cooperation with the United States remains lim-
ited.  In August  2024,  China  announced  that  it  would  expand  regu-
latory  controls  to  cover  three  additional  fentanyl  precursors.58 This
move  came  two  years  after  UN  member  states  agreed  to  subject
these inputs to international restrictions.59 (For more on U.S.-China
counternarcotics diplomacy, see Chapter 2, “U.S.-China Security and
Foreign Affairs (Year in Review).”) However, as of October 11, 2024,
China has not placed controls on other common fentanyl precursors,
despite continued U.S. diplomatic pressure.† 60

Illicit Actors Evade Tariffs through Customs Fraud

The  increase  in  tariffs  on  Chinese  products  created  a  significant
incentive to lower or evade U.S. import duties, leading to an increase
in  trade-related  fraud. To  avoid  paying  duties,  firms  may  employ  a
wide  range  of  illegal  and  deceptive  tactics,  with  two  being  particu-
larly  prominent.61  First,  importers  may  file  false  invoices  with  U.S.
customs to evade tariffs, misreporting the nature of the merchandise
through  tactics  including  undervaluation,  product  misclassification,
and other methods.62 Second, importers may employ transshipment
and  circumvention  schemes  to  route  goods  through  third  country
markets to obtain a more favorable duty rate.63

The  number  of  customs  violations  penalized  by  the  U.S.  govern-
ment rose following the introduction of the China Section 301 tariffs
and  other  trade  measures  aimed  at  China.  Between  October  2018
and  September  2019—the  first  fiscal  year  after  the  Office  of  the
U.S.  Trade  Representative  initiated  the  China  Section  301  trade
actions—CBP  collected  $30.1  million  in  penalties  and  liquidated

minimis shipments.

† For example, China currently does not have control measures for N-Phenethyl-4-piperidone (NPP)
and  4-Anilino-N-phenethylpiperidine  (ANPP),  two  precursors  that  are  extensively  used  by  Mexican
drug  cartels  in  fentanyl  production.  These  chemicals,  among  others,  are  included  in  Table  I  of  the
1988 UN Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances, to which
China is a signatory. The agreement requires members to take measures to prevent the distribution
of  listed  substances  for  the  illicit  manufacture  of  drugs  and  maintain  systems  to  monitor  manufac-
ture  and  distribution  of  listed  substances  for  legitimate  purposes.  John  Coyne  and  Liam Auliciems,

damages *  related  to  customs  violations,  double  the  value  collected
in  FY  2018.64  In  FY  2022,  the  most  recent  period  for  which  CBP
has published data, this amount fell back to $19.3 million, yet CBP
still issued nearly twice as many penalties and liquidated damages
compared  to  FY  2018,  suggesting  that  the  frequency  of  infractions
remains above norm.65 The import value related to these infractions
is  not  available.  CBP  also  collected  $78  million  in  unpaid  duties  as
a result of audits in FY 2022 and identified $97 million in lost val-
ue  or  revenue  through  investigations  into  AD/CVD  evasion  under
its  Enforce  and  Protect  Act  (EAPA)  authority,  up  from  $42  million
resulting  from  audits  and  $15  million  from  EAPA  investigations  in
FY  2018.66  It  is  likely  that  additional  illicit  activity  has  gone  un-
detected.  Though  it  is  difficult  to  estimate  the  true  scale  of  illegal
activity, signs suggest that trade misinvoicing and illegal transship-
ment have grown more rampant since 2018.

Duty Evasion through False Import Declarations

The  declining  quality  of  U.S.  import  data  points  toward  systemic
tariff  avoidance.  U.S.  duty  assessment  is  based  on  customs  docu-
mentation filed by importers, creating an incentive to misreport the
nature of the imported merchandise.67 Such tactics include underre-
porting the value of the shipment or misclassifying the merchandise
as a different Harmonized Tariff System (HTS) heading to obtain a
lower duty.68 According to the U.S. Government Accountability Office
(GAO), “Many trade-related documents, such as purchase orders, in-
voices, and customs documents, are vulnerable to fraudulent manip-
ulation.” 69 Because such evasive activity leads to a poor-quality data
environment,  it  is  not  possible  to  accurately  measure  the  impact  of
illicit  import  invoices.  However,  researchers  have  taken  advantage
of  discrepancies  in  trade  data  gathered  by  U.S.  and  Chinese  statis-
tical authorities to approximate the level of trade fraud; though U.S.
tariffs create a financial incentive to falsify information reported to
U.S.  customs,  they  have  little  effect  on  companies’  incentives  to  file
accurate  export  invoices  with  Chinese  customs.  According  to  these
studies, importers may be understating their U.S. imports by tens of
billions of dollars per year (for more, see textbox below).70

Customs Fraud, De Minimis Shipments, and Worsening
Data on the U.S.-China Trade Deficit

The  true  value  of  the  bilateral  trade  deficit  between  the  United
States  and  China  is  likely  tens  of  billions  of  dollars  higher  than
reported  in  official  U.S.  trade  estimates.  U.S.  data  on  imports  from
China  are  based  on  customs  declarations,  meaning  that  tariff  eva-
sion  creates  errors  in  aggregate  U.S.  trade  data  and  leads  to  dis-
crepancies with the trade data reported by Chinese customs author-

* CBP  has  legislative  authority  to  issue  penalties  for  filing  fraudulent  customs  documentation
and  other  tactics  to  evade  customs  enforcement.  In  addition,  many  importers  are  required  to
purchase  importation  bonds,  which  are  surety  bonds  that  form  a  contract  between  CBP  and  the
importer.  If  the  importer  breaches  its  obligations  under  the  bond,  including  by  violating  trade
laws and regulations, CBP can collect liquidated damages against the import bond. U.S. Customs

Customs Fraud, De Minimis Shipments, and Worsening
Data on the U.S.-China Trade Deficit—Continued
ities. Mirror trade analysis is a commonly used technique to identify
false  or  missing  customs  declarations  based  on  differences  in  trade
reported  by  the  customs  agencies  of  the  exporting  and  importing
nations.* 71  Prior  to  2018,  the  U.S.  Census  Bureau’s  estimates  on
imports  of  goods  from  China  have  exceeded  the  equivalent  figure
from  China’s  customs  agency  by  an  average  of  $95  billion,  largely
owing  to  financial  incentives  for  Chinese  firms  to  underreport  the
value of exports to Chinese customs to receive tax advantages under
China’s  value-added  tax  regime  prior  to  2018.72  However,  this  pat-
tern has reversed since the Section 301 tariffs went into effect (see
Figure  2).  In  2020,  the  gap  between  U.S.  and  Chinese  data  all  but
disappeared  as  the  United  States  reported  a  steeper  decline  in  im-
ports than China.73 Economists at the U.S. Federal Reserve estimate
that  $55  billion  in  value  is  missing  from  U.S.  import  data  due  to
firms’ efforts to avoid U.S. tariffs.† 74 Because of this evasion, Adam
Wolfe, emerging markets economist for Absolute Strategy Research,
assesses that “Chinese data are likely more reliable since U.S.-based
firms have a financial incentive to understate their imports to avoid
paying higher tariffs.” 75

* As  reviewed  in  a  recent  GAO  report,  mirror  trade  analysis  has  significant  limitations  when
it  comes  to  identifying  illicit  trade  behavior.  Legitimate  reasons  for  trade  gaps  may  exist,  such
as  differing  customs  valuation  methodologies  between  different  countries.  U.S.  Government  Ac-

† The change in  the reported  data was  also  a  result  of  Chinese exporters overstating the value of
shipments to Chinese customs. China lowered the gross value-added tax and raised the value-added
tax rebate on exports after the tariffs went into effect, changing the incentives for Chinese firms to re-
port the value of their exports. Economists Hunter L. Clark and Anna Wong find that the value-added
tax  effect  caused  China’s  reported  exports  to  increase  (leading  to  a  smaller  gap  in  U.S.-China  trade
data), but this effect was marginal compared to the undervaluation effect in U.S. import data. Hunt-

Customs Fraud, De Minimis Shipments, and Worsening
Data on the U.S.-China Trade Deficit—Continued
Two  tactics  to  avoid  tariffs  are  likely  to  blame  for  the  deteri-
oration  in  the  quality  of  U.S.  trade  data.  First,  some  U.S.-based
importers  have  evaded  tariffs  by  illicitly  misreporting  the  value
of  shipments  to  U.S.  customs  officials,  since  underreporting  the
value reduces the gross import tax assessed on each shipment.76
Second,  shipments  valued  less  than  $800  that  utilize  the  de  mi-
nimis  exemption  are  not  included  in  the  U.S.  Census  Bureau’s
trade  estimates.77  This  data  gap  alone  leaves  potentially  tens
of  billions  of  dollars  in  unaccounted  imports  from  China-based
e-commerce  companies;  CBP  estimates  that  $54.5  billion  in  de
minimis  shipments  from  all  countries  entered  the  United  States
in FY 2023.* 78

Distorted trade data may prevent U.S. policymakers from de-
signing  effective  trade  and  supply  chain  policies  and  obscure
the  true  extent  of  the  United  States’  continued  reliance  on
Chinese  manufacturers.  For  instance,  recorded  U.S.  imports  of
clothing  from  China  have  declined  39  percent  between  2018
and  2023,  according  to  U.S.  customs  data;  however,  estimates
indicate  that  textile  and  apparel  products  make  up  around
half of all de minimis shipments entering the United States.79
Moreover,  these  problematic  data  potentially  compromise  the
U.S.  government’s  ability  to  evaluate  the  impact  of  tariffs  on
the  U.S.  economy.  For  instance,  the  U.S.  International  Trade
Commission’s  2023  Economic  Impact  of  Section  232  and  301
Tariffs  on  U.S.  Industries  report  relies  on  U.S.  Census  Bureau
data  to  model  the  impact  of  the  tariffs  on  trade,  production,
and  prices,  and  its  findings  could  be  flawed  if  the  data  are
problematic.80

Legal  action  targeting  evasion  of  China  Section  301  tariffs  has
been limited. To date, the U.S. government has penalized only a few
instances of Section 301 evasion under the False Claims Act (FCA),
which  prohibits  making  false  statements  or  otherwise  defrauding
the  U.S.  government,  including  false  customs  documentation.81 The
FCA  contains  a  whistleblower  provision  whereby  a  person  can  file
a lawsuit based on allegations of fraud against the government, in-
cluding  customs  evasion,  and  be  financially  rewarded  for  it.†  Up
to  May  2024,  the  U.S.  government  has  reached  settlements  in  four
cases  under  the  FCA  that  involved  evasion  of  China  Section  301

* The consistency of the de minimis value estimates produced by CBP is questionable. The Coa-
lition for a Prosperous America asserts that CBP relies only on data submitted through electronic
manifests,  which  cover  only  a  portion  of  the  shipments.  Compared  to  CBP’s  estimate  of  $46.5
billion in imports in FY 2021, the organization instead estimates that the United States import-
ed  $188  billion  in  de  minimis  shipments  in  2022. A  separate  study  based  on  data  on  shipments
valued  under  $800  from  three  global  carriers  implies  that  the  average  shipment  was  valued  at
$120 in 2021. This suggests that FY 2021 de minimis imports totaled $82.2 billion. Pablo D. Fa-
jgelbaum and Amit Khandelwal, “The Value of De Minimis Imports,” NBER Working Paper, June

duties,  with  settlements  totaling  $5.7  million.82  These  cases  likely
reflect  only  a  portion  of  the  ongoing  litigation,  as  other  cases  may
be  held  under  seal  within  the  U.S.  court  system  until  a  settlement
or judgment is reached.* 83 Historically, the amount of time required
to  complete  an  FCA  customs  case—from  filing  the  case  to  reaching
a  settlement—averaged  3.1  years.84  However,  the  FCA  may  be  un-
derutilized  to  pursue  customs  evasion  due  to  the  complexities  of
such  cases.  For  instance,  the  U.S.  Department  of  Justice  has  the
option to intervene and take over a case, a move that increases the
chances  of  success  due  to  the  resources  available  to  government
prosecutors.† 85  The  government  is  less  likely  to  intervene  in  cas-
es  involving  smaller  financial  stakes  or  where  the  evidence  is  not
particularly strong.86 A whistleblower may choose to litigate a case
independently, but they will need to bear the legal costs themselves.
Customs  fraud  cases  may  be  particularly  complex  to  litigate  inde-
pendently  given  the  complicated  and  often  arcane  nature  of  U.S.
customs regulations.87 In addition, potential whistleblowers may be
located  outside  the  United  States,  making  them  reticent  to  file  out
of fear of retaliatory action.‡

Whistleblower lawsuits under the FCA complement direct govern-
mental  authorities  to  pursue  customs  fraud.  CBP  has  a  statutory
mandate  to  detect  and  penalize  customs  fraud  under  the Tariff Act
of  1930.88 To  aid  its  enforcement  efforts,  CBP  provides  a  monetary
incentive,  separate  from  the  FCA  provisions,  for  whistleblowers  to
flag instances of evasion and transshipment.89 However, CBP is not
required  to  respond  to  or  publicly  report  on  the  results  of  investi-
gations  into  such  allegations.90  As  Ms.  Drake  testified  before  the
Commission,  the  enforcement  process  is  opaque,  and  “the  private
sector has no formal role in helping Customs guard against evasion”
of customs duties other than AD/CVD.91 In contrast, the tools avail-
able  to  combat  AD/CVD  evasion—the  anti-circumvention  statute
administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce and the Enforce
and  Protect Act  (EAPA)  authorities  administered  by  CBP—provide
specific timelines and statutory requirements to involve private pe-
titioners and have been viewed as highly effective.92 (For more, see
Appendix  II,  “Authorities  for  Combating  Evasion  of  U.S.  Customs

* When  an  FCA  case  is  filed  with  a  court,  the  court  initially  places  the  case  under  seal  for
60  days,  but  the  U.S.  government  may  request  the  court  extend  the  seal  so  it  can  conduct  its
investigation.  While  the  case  is  under  seal,  the  court  will  not  acknowledge  the  existence  of  the
lawsuit, and the case will not appear on the court’s publicly available electronic docket (PACER).

trade-related  crimes  and  coordinate  with  other  agencies,  such  as  CBP,  on  ensuring  compliance
with  U.S.  trade  laws.  However,  some  assess  that  the  task  force  has  limited  capacity  given  the
scale of international trade crime it faces. Camille Edwards and Olga Torres, “DOJ Involvement

‡ The FCA allows for foreign whistleblowers to file cases of fraud against the U.S. government,
but they may not be afforded the same whistleblower protections as U.S. citizens or employees of
U.S. companies. Though such lawsuits can be filed anonymously, the identity of the whistleblower
may be easy to deduce once the court case is unsealed. The FCA includes a provision that offers
relief  to  employees  who  experience  retaliation  or  job  loss  for  filing  fraud  allegations,  including
reinstatement to their position. However, for employees working overseas, the process of filing a
claim  of  retaliation  is  complex,  and  the  provision  may  not  extend  to  foreign  companies  not  gov-
erned by U.S. law. Tycko & Zavareei, “International Whistleblower Protections;” Jason Zuckerman

Other Tariffs.”)

Transshipment  and  Circumvention  through  Third  Country

Markets

Trade data indicate that some countries have emerged as hubs for
the transshipment of goods and duty evasion through circumvention
strategies. As  U.S.  imports  shifted  to  third  countries,  some  Chinese
exporters  sought  to  lower  their  tariff  burden  by  transiting  goods
through these new export hubs. In 2019, Vietnam’s customs agency
identified  dozens  of  products  destined  for  the  United  States  that
were  imported  from  China  and  given  “made  in  Vietnam”  labels.93
Closely  related  to  transshipment  is  duty  circumvention,  which  in-
volves  importing  products  subject  to  an  AD/CVD  order  or  compo-
nents of those products into a third country, doing minimal addition-
al processing (e.g., assembling components), and exporting the final
product  as  originating  in  the  country  of  minimal  processing.* 94  It
is challenging, however, to quantify the full extent of transshipment
and  circumvention  (see  textbox  below).  Between  FY  2017  and  FY
2023,  CBP  completed  more  than  200  investigations  into  AD/CVD
evasion  under  the  EAPA  and  identified  $1.2  billion  in  duties  owed
to the U.S. government.95

Evaluating Transshipment and Circumvention Based on
Trade Data

As  documented  by  a  number  of  scholars,  third  countries  that
increased  their  exports  to  the  United  States  since  2017  fre-
quently  increased  imports  from  China  of  the  exact  same  product
codes  they  were  shipping  to  the  United  States,  suggesting  that
finished  goods  were  merely  being  rerouted  through  other  econo-
mies.96 However, the correlation between third countries’ imports
from  China  and  exports  to  the  United  States  may  also  reflect
legitimate  trade.  Rules  of  origin  can  be  complicated  and  very
product-specific.  Even  when  a  product  imported  from  China  is
exported  without  a  change  in  its  tariff  classification,  a  domestic
manufacturer can significantly transform the good in a way that
meets  U.S.  criteria  for  country  of  origin.  Further,  the  apparent
flow  of  Chinese  products  through  these  markets  may  instead  re-
flect  imports  for  final  demand  by  these  countries.  Since  produc-
ers  in  other  economies  may  struggle  to  match  the  cost  efficiency
of  Chinese  production,  these  economies  may  purchase  low-cost
goods  from  China  for  domestic  consumption  as  well  as  engage
in some level of additional processing for re-export to the United
States.  For  instance,  after  the  United  States  placed  an  AD/CVD
on  Chinese  solar  panels  in  the  early  2010s,  Chinese  solar  com-
panies  sought  out  other  markets  for  their  subsidized  production,
causing  shipments  of  solar  products  that  were  previously  bound
for  the  United  States  to  shift  to  countries  such  as  Malaysia.97
Many  of  these  Chinese  imports  were  used  for  solar  installation

* AD/CVD  circumvention  as  defined  in  the Tariff Act  of  1930  also  covers  making  minor  alter-
ations in the original country so that the product falls outside the coverage of the AD/CVD order
while  still  retaining  the  same  general  characteristics. Tariff Act  of  1930  § 1677j,  Pub.  L.  71-361,
codified at 19 U.S. Code § 1677j, 1994.

Evaluating Transshipment and Circumvention Based on

in Malaysia.98 Meanwhile, Malaysia’s domestic solar industry ex-
panded  rapidly,  fueled  by  investments  from  Chinese  and  South
Korean solar producers.99 Since they could not compete domesti-
cally  on  cost  with  unfairly  traded  Chinese  imports,  this  produc-
tion  was  exported.100  Some  Malaysia-based  production  involved
minimal  additional  processing  of  imported  Chinese  components
and  was  found  by  the  Commerce  Department  to  constitute  eva-
sion  of  U.S.  trade  remedy  duties  on  Chinese  imports.101  Some  of
the new production, however, involved substantial manufacturing
in  Malaysia  and  was  not  found  by  the  Commerce  Department  to
constitute  circumvention.102 These  facts  demonstrate  that  trans-
shipment  and  evasion  activities  can  occur  alongside  legitimate
trade flows.* 103

Transshipment and circumvention can create risks for the United
States by obscuring an import’s source country and factory, increas-
ing  the  challenge  of  securing  supply  chains  against  regions  known
for  hazardous  or  unethical  sourcing  and  production  practices.  For
instance,  China  is  the  world’s  largest  importer  of  timber  that  is  at
high  risk  of  having  been  cut  through  illegal  logging,  the  import  of
which is banned in the United States.104 Since 2017, an accelerating
volume  of  wooden  furniture  appeared  to  flow  from  China  into Viet-
nam for export to the United States, raising the risk that unethically
or illegally sourced timber enters the domestic market.105 More fun-
damentally, Chinese exporters that are willing to transship products
illegally are also less likely to adhere to U.S. safety and quality stan-
dards, as exemplified by the “honey laundering” practice of Chinese
honey producers. Since the United States placed antidumping duties
on  Chinese  honey  in  2001,  Chinese  producers  used  transshipment
schemes  involving Thailand,  Malaysia,  the  Philippines,  Russia,  and
other countries to continue accessing the U.S. market, some of which
involved  adulterating  the  honey  to  obscure  its  origin,  affecting  the
quality  and  safety  of  the  honey.106  Due  to  these  ongoing  tactics,  in
2020 CBP released a strategy for testing honey imports to verify the
country of origin and detect adulteration.107

Chinese  State  Support  for  Overseas  Manufacturing  Likely

Perpetuates Economic Distortions

Chinese  companies,  particularly  those  that  benefit  from  state
support, are seeking to avoid tariffs by moving production overseas.
Previously, when the United States used AD/CVD orders to address
non-market  support  in  certain  Chinese  sectors,  some  Chinese  com-

* On August 18, 2023, the Commerce Department issued its final determination on circumven-
tion of AD/CVD orders on solar cells and modules from China. It concluded that five firms located
in  Cambodia,  Thailand,  and  Vietnam  were  re-exporting  Chinese  solar  products  to  evade  U.S.
duties. It investigated two companies operating in Malaysia—South Korea’s Hanwha Q Cells and
China’s  Jinko  Solar—but  determined  that  these  companies  were  not  circumventing  the  orders.
The department also placed a country-wide circumvention finding on all four economies, meaning
that  all  exporters  in  these  markets  must  certify  that  they  are  not  circumventing  the  AD/CVD
orders  before  they  are  allowed  to  import  the  product  under  the  most-favored-nation  tariff.  U.S.

panies  responded  by  setting  up  factories  overseas  to  continue  ex-
porting  to  the  United  States.  Despite  being  located  outside  of  Chi-
na, many of these manufacturers continued to benefit from Chinese
government  support  and  sell  goods  at  less  than  market  value.  Ms.
Drake notes multiple examples where Chinese companies increased
outbound investment after the United States reached an affirmative
finding  in  investigations  and  applied  duties.108  Chinese  tire  manu-
facturers  that  were  impacted  by  U.S. AD/CVD  orders  on  passenger
vehicle and light truck tires (issued in 2015) and truck and bus tires
(issued  in  2019)  subsequently  set  up  plants  in  Thailand,  Vietnam,
and  Taiwan.109  Exports  from  these  economies  have  since  surged.
Between  2020  and  2022,  U.S.  imports  of  truck  and  bus  tires  from
Thailand  more  than  doubled  from  4.7  million  units  to  10.2  million
units.110  Three  Chinese  companies  have  opened  factories  in  Thai-
land since 2017, helping drive the surge in exports.* 111 Following a
petition  from  the  United  Steelworkers,  the  Commerce  Department
initiated  an  antidumping  investigation  into  imports  of  these  tires
from Thailand in November 2023, and in October 2024 it found that
Thailand-based tire manufacturers were dumping their products in
the United States.112 Since 2017, similar patterns have emerged or
accelerated  in  other  sectors  subject  to  U.S. AD/CVD  orders,  includ-
ing China’s quartz producers and its steel industry.113

Such  producers  may  benefit  from  Chinese  policies  to  push  man-
ufacturing  capacity  overseas.  Though  the  true  level  of  non-market
support to overseas production platforms is difficult to quantify, the
Commerce  Department  as  well  as  multiple  analysts  assess  that
their  scale  is  growing.114  The  Party-state  has  long  supported  Chi-
nese  companies  with  surplus  industrial  capacity  to  set  up  facilities
overseas. (For more on the role of Chinese producers in U.S. imports
from  Vietnam  and  other  third  countries,  see  Chapter  1,  “U.S.-Chi-
na  Economic  and  Trade  Relations  (Year  in  Review).”)  At  the  2014
China-ASEAN Summit, then Premier Li Keqiang stated that China
encourages “competitive Chinese producers of iron and steel, cement
and  plate,  etc.  to  shift  their  operation  to ASEAN  countries  to  meet
the  local  need  of  infrastructure  development  through  investment,
leasing,  and  loan  lending  so  as  to  achieve  mutual  benefit.” 115  Chi-
na’s Belt and Road Initiative widened financing channels to support
foreign  direct  investment  (FDI)  in  member  countries,  and  many  of
the projects financed by China’s policy banks, including China Exim
Bank  and  China  Development  Bank,  involved  overseas  production
facilities in steel, textiles, metals, and other areas where China has
domestic  surplus  capacity.116 Though  these  policies  are  not  specific
to companies subject to antidumping or antisubsidy measures, some
companies have taken advantage of China’s “Going Out” policy † and
the  Belt  and  Road  Initiative  explicitly  to  avoid  such  duties.  For  in-

* In  its  AD/CVD  investigation  of  truck  and  bus  tires  from  China,  the  Commerce  Department
found that one of these companies, Double Coin Holding, benefited from state subsidies. In 2017,
the Commerce Department assessed a 38.6 percent subsidy rate on Double Coin in addition to an
economy-wide  22.6  percent  dumping  rate.  Meanwhile,  Double  Coin  invested  $285  million  to  set
up a factory in Thailand, which began producing tires for the U.S. market in 2018. Tire Business,

2012  in  Egypt  for  the  explicit  purpose  of  avoiding  trade  remedies
imposed  by  the  EU  that  began  in  2011.117  An  executive  of  one  of
the  subsidiaries,  Jushi,  stated,  “If  you  export  fiberglass  to  Europe
from China, you have to pay antidumping and antisubsidy duties of
24.8  percent,  not  to  mention  the  tariff. There  is  no  tariff  if  you  ex-
port to Europe or the Middle East from Egypt, nor any antidumping
and antisubsidy duties.” 118 The European Commission subsequently
initiated an antisubsidy investigation into Jushi’s Egypt production
over  support  provided  by  China.  In  2020,  the  EU  imposed  counter-
vailing  duties  on  certain  glass  fiber  products  from  Egypt  (see  text-
box below).119

EU Antisubsidy Investigations Document How Chinese
State Support Is Funneled through Overseas Special
Economic Zones

The  EU  has  applied  its  antisubsidy  and  antidumping  laws  in
novel  ways  to  respond  to  Chinese  subsidies  to  overseas  subsid-
iaries.  The  European  Commission’s  investigation  into  state  sup-
port  for  Egypt-based  subsidiaries  of  Chinese  companies  in  the
fiberglass  industry  concluded  in  2020,  resulting  in  AD/CVD  or-
ders targeting exports from entities based in both Egypt and Chi-
na.120  The  investigation  found  that  the  Chinese-owned  entities
received support from the Chinese government through a special
economic  zone  set  up  jointly  by  the  two  governments  called  the
China-Egypt Suez Economic and Trade Cooperation Zone.121 The
commission  concluded  that  the  companies  in  the  zone  benefited
from  various  forms  of  state  support,  including  preferential  loans
from  Chinese  banks,  loans  and  capital  injections  from  the  state-
owned parent companies, and direct subsidies from the Egyptian
government.122  While  the  details  of  the  financing  arrangements
were  not  fully  disclosed  by  the  parties  involved,*  Chinese  state
support  clearly  assisted  the  development  of  Chinese  industrial
champions  in  Egypt.123  Notably,  the  European  Commission  at-
tributed  Chinese  state  support  to  the  Egyptian  government,  us-
ing a legal workaround in order to apply EU antisubsidy laws to
the case. The treatment of transnational subsidies remains a con-
tested  issue  under  the WTO Agreement  on  Subsidies  and  Coun-
tervailing  Measures,  with  differing  interpretations  on  whether
the  subsidy  recipient  must  be  located  in  the  same  territory  as
the  government  or  public  body  providing  the  aid.† 124  Instead  of

† Separate  from  the  transnational  subsidy  issue,  the  United  States  alleges  that  prior  rulings
at  the  WTO  hamper  efforts  to  punish  China’s  unfair  trade  practices.  As  a  result  of  another
U.S.-China dispute in 2008, the WTO determined that Chinese state-owned enterprises and Chi-

ruling on the matter, the European Commission determined that
Egypt  had  actively  sought  and  cooperated  with  China  to  invite
the financial support to the special economic zone, which enabled
the  commission  to  make  a  ruling  under  its  existing  antisubsidy
statutes.125

In  2022,  the  European  Commission  applied  a  similar  reason-
ing  to  impose  countervailing  duties  on  steel  producers  in  Indo-
nesia  that  benefited  from  Chinese  support.* 126  At  Indonesia’s
request, the WTO established a dispute settlement panel in May
2023  to  examine  whether  the  EU  acted  inconsistently  with  the
Agreement  on  Subsidies  and  Countervailing  Measures  when  it
attributed Chinese financial contributions to the Indonesian gov-
ernment.† 127

Before 2024, the United States did not treat cross-border support
to  Chinese  production  facilities  located  in  third  countries  as  coun-
tervailable  subsidies.128  Prior  to  a  policy  revision  issued  in  March
2024, the Commerce Department’s regulations precluded the agency
from  countervailing  cross-border  support  for  production.‡ 129  Con-
sequently,  it  has  only  ever  assessed  support  provided  by  the  host
government to domestic enterprises in previous countervailing duty
investigations.130  Additionally,  the  “non-market  economy”  method-
ology  for  the  Commerce  Department’s  antidumping  investigations
prevented  the  government  from  examining  cases  where  a  producer
in  a  market  economy,  such  as  India,  benefited  from  equipment  and
raw  material  imported  from  China  at  below-market  prices.131  In
March  2024,  the  Commerce  Department  updated  its  methodology

nese  state  commercial  banks  would  not  be  considered “public  bodies.” The WTO  opined  that  the
United  States  was  imposing  excess  AD/CVDs  because  it  was  too  broad  in  its  interpretation  of
“public  body”  and,  consequently,  its  assessment  of  China’s  state  subsidies. “The  mere  fact  that  a
government  is  the  majority  shareholder  of  an  entity  does  not  demonstrate  that  the  government
exercises meaningful control over the conduct of that entity, much less that the government has

cost  to  its  own  taxpayers,  manufacturing  or  higher  employment  in  foreign  countries.”  However,

Consumer  Safety  Enforcement  inside  China’s

Domestic  Market

In the past 15 years, China has significantly strengthened and ex-
panded its domestic consumer product safety regulatory regime fol-
lowing  a  deadly  food  safety  scandal.  In  2008,  an  estimated  300,000
infants and young children across China fell ill and six babies died
after  consuming  milk  powder  containing  melamine,  an  industrial
chemical used in plastics and fertilizer.134 The melamine was inten-
tionally  added  to  the  powder  by  the  producer  in  order  to  fool  tests
that  measure  protein  content.135  Following  the  events  of  the  scan-
dal,  in  2009  the  Standing  Committee  of  the  National  People’s  Con-
gress  repealed  the  country’s  1995  Food  Hygiene  Law  and  replaced
it  with  the  significantly  expanded  Food  Safety  Law.136 This  revised
regulation contained 104 articles, created the country’s Food Safety
Commission,  and  established  a  national  food  recall  system,  among
other  acts.137  The  Chinese  government  has  amended  and  expand-
ed  the  Food  Safety  Law  several  times,  including  in  2015  and  most
recently in 2023.138 Alongside revising food safety for domestic pro-
duction, the Chinese government significantly expanded regulations
for  cosmetics  and  medical  devices  as  well.139  The  government  also
implemented a significant bureaucratic reorganization to consolidate
and  streamline  market  regulation.  In  2018,  the  government  creat-
ed  the  State Administration  for  Market  Regulation  (SAMR),  which
consolidated the function of several previously independent agencies
responsible for regulating a range of products, including food, drugs,
toys, and consumer goods.140 SAMR has a broad mandate, replacing
the China Food and Drug Administration to regulate drug safety su-
pervision and overseeing production permits for industrial products,
product quality inspections, the reporting system for product quality
and product recalls, and anti-counterfeiting efforts.141

Despite this bureaucratic reorganization and wide-ranging reg-
ulatory expansion, the Chinese government remains unable to ef-
fectively  regulate  consumer  and  food  products,  creating  risks  for

* The  Commerce  Department  issued  a  preliminary  affirmative  determination  in  October  2024,
and it set countervailing duty rates on solar products from these four countries. The agency also
calculated preliminary countervailing duty rates for companies that benefited from policy lending

dents  that  complied  with  the  investigation  benefited  from  these  Chinese  programs.  U.S.  Depart-

Chinese and U.S. consumers. A 2018 study conducted by research-
ers from Tsinghua University and University of Cambridge found
that  12  percent  of  toys  purchased  from  Taobao—an  e-commerce
website  owned  by  Alibaba  that  operates  almost  exclusively  in
China—contained  lead  levels  exceeding  China’s  regulatory  stan-
dard  for  paints  in  toy  manufacturing.142 When  compared  against
U.S. lead standards, the percentage of offensive toys increased to
nearly 36 percent.143 In July 2024, Chinese state media reported
that  shipping  companies  were  using  the  same  tanker  trucks  to
carry cooking oil and toxic liquids without cleaning the trucks in
between,  leading  to  an  investigation  by  Chinese  authorities.144
In  addition  to  exposing  Chinese  consumers  to  health  and  safety
risks,  the  Chinese  government’s  inability  to  set  and  uniformly
enforce product safety regulations has led to policy inconsistency,
which  harms  Chinese  and  international  firms  operating  in  Chi-
na  alike.  In  a  2024  white  paper,  the American  Chamber  of  Com-
merce  in  China  (AmCham  China)  noted  that  the  requirements
facing  U.S.  cosmetic  companies  to  register  and  file  a  review  for
foreign-made  cosmetic  products  are “not  sufficiently  transparent,
with  inconsistent  standards  of  review,  and  sometimes  unclear
conclusions,  affecting  the  registration  process  of  cosmetics”  while
creating  inefficiencies  and  raising  costs.145

Instead of improving product safety, the Chinese government has
at  times  leveraged  it  to  undercut  foreign  firms  operating  in  Chi-
na  while  punishing  foreign  governments  for  undesirable  policies.
In  June  2021,  China’s  General  Administration  of  Customs  (GAC)
released  a  list  of “quality  and  safety  unqualified”  products  from  16
companies, including H&M, Nike, and Zara.146 The GAC’s announce-
ment  was  part  of  a  broader  campaign  by  the  Chinese  government
targeting  U.S.  and  other  foreign  firms  in  retaliation  for  their  state-
ments  against  forced  labor  in  China’s  western  province  of  Xinjiang
as  well  as  actions  taken  by  their  home  governments.  Six  months
before the Customs Administration announcement, in January 2021,
CBP began banning cotton and tomato products from Xinjiang pur-
suant to an order by the Trump Administration.147 By March 2021,
Britain,  Canada,  and  the  EU  had  all  joined  the  United  States  in
imposing  sanctions  on  China  for  its  abuses  in  the  region.148  In  re-
taliation,  the  Chinese  government  took  a  series  of  actions  meant
to  decrease  the  availability  and  profitability  of  major  U.S.,  Euro-
pean,  and  Japanese  clothing  brands  sold  in  the  Chinese  market.
Chinese  state  media  fomented  an  ostensibly  grassroots  call  for  a
boycott  of  H&M,  resurfacing  a  statement  the  company  made  the
prior  year  confirming  that  it  had  stopped  sourcing  Xinjiang  cotton
due to forced labor concerns.149 H&M’s products were then removed
from  Chinese  e-commerce  websites,  and  the  addresses  for  its  ap-
proximately 500 stores in China were removed from the ride-hailing
app  Didi  Chuxing.150  Apps  associated  with  Nike  and  Adidas  were
pulled, and Chinese celebrities exited endorsement deals with these
and other foreign companies.151 The accusations by China’s customs
agency  of  unsafe  products  further  galvanized  Chinese  consumers,
who switched away from foreign brands in favor of domestic produc-
ers, resulting in U.S. firms like Nike losing market share to Chinese
competitors like Anta Sports and Li Ning.152

U.S. Import Regulations and Consumer Goods from

China

Trends in Health and Safety in China-Based Manufacturing

China is a primary source of consumer product imports for the
United States, with e-commerce becoming an increasingly import-
ant  pathway  for  U.S.  consumers  to  purchase  goods  from  China.
Since  2000,  the  proportion  of  U.S.  consumers  shopping  online  in-
creased  from  22  percent  to  79  percent.153  At  the  same  time,  the
number of China-based sellers on U.S. e-commerce sites as well as
the  number  of  U.S.  users  shopping  on  Chinese  e-commerce  web-
sites  has  increased  substantially.  In  December  2023,  almost  49
percent  of Amazon’s  top  third-party  sellers  were  based  in  China,
up from 18 percent in January 2017.154 Similarly, in 2022 nearly
half  of  all  new  third-party  sellers  on Walmart.com  were  based  in
China.155  In  parallel,  Chinese  e-commerce  platforms  Shein  and
Temu  have  experienced  a  recent  boom  in  popularity  among  U.S.
users. Between September 2022 and October 2023, the number of
monthly  active  U.S.  users  on  Shein  almost  doubled  from  27  mil-
lion to 51 million, while the number of Temu users increased from
just  1.5  million  to  over  133  million  during  the  same  period.156
The  business  models  of  these  e-commerce  platforms  often  facil-
itate  the  direct  shipment  of  consumer  goods  from  China-based
manufacturers  to  U.S.  consumers.

The  safety  and  quality  of  imported  consumer  goods  from  China
has  historically  been  a  concern  for  the  United  States,  with  product
issues  reaching  a  peak  in  2007.  Dubbed  the  “Year  of  the  Recall”
by  Consumer  Reports,  in  2007  millions  of  units  of  Chinese-made
products  were  recalled  for  serious  health  and  safety  violations,  in-
cluding  one  million  cribs  presenting  strangulation  risks,  175  mil-
lion pieces of children’s jewelry made with hazardous levels of lead,
and  175,000  Curious  George  plush  dolls  contaminated  with  lead,
among  other  products.* 157 While  these  recalls  affected  a  variety  of
goods,  children  faced  a  disproportionately  high  risk;  of  the  448  re-
calls  issued  by  the  Consumer  Product  Safety  Commission  (CPSC)
in 2007, 52 percent were for children’s products.† 158 Unfortunately,
the  consequences  of  using  these  unsafe  goods  were  severe  in  many
cases. In a 2007 recall notice for drop-side cribs, CPSC stated it was
aware  of  at  least  two  infant  deaths  associated  with  the  crib  and
noted that a third was under investigation.159 By 2010, the number
of  recalled  drop-side  cribs  had  increased  to  over  nine  million,  and
the number of reported deaths rose to over 30 in the United States
alone.160 Flaws existed in both the design and materials of the cribs,
manufacturing  of  which  had  been  outsourced  to  China;  drop-side
cribs could be installed incorrectly by parents, and plastic materials
that  were  less  sturdy  than  traditional  wood  and  metal  cribs  could

* Product recalls were not limited to consumer goods and also included food products regulated
by  the  Food  and  Drug  Administration  (FDA),  including  five  types  of  farmed  fish  and  seafood

† In 2005 and 2006, CPSC issued 321 and 320 recalls, respectively. In 2007, the number of re-
calls increased 40 percent to 448. Kids in Danger, “2007: The Year of the Recall: An Examination

fail  and  break.* 161  Risks  of  unsafe  Chinese-made  products  were
not  just  limited  to  human  consumers.  In  2007,  pet  food  made  with
melamine-tainted wheat gluten supplied by Chinese manufacturers
was linked to the death of as many as 8,500 pet cats and dogs.162

A significant legislative overhaul in consumer product safety reg-
ulations  increased  CPSC  capacity  and  authority  and  preceded  a
steady  decrease  in  CPSC-issued  recalls  up  to  2021.  In  2008,  Con-
gress  passed  the  Consumer  Product  Safety  Improvement  Act  (CP-
SIA) both as a response to the series of high-profile recalls made the
year  prior  and  as  the  culmination  of  grassroots  efforts  to  improve
product  safety,  particularly  in  goods  made  for  children.163  CPSIA
provided CPSC with an expanded set of regulatory and enforcement
tools  and  included  provisions  addressing  myriad  issues  like  lead,
phthalates, toy safety, third-party testing and certification, and civil
and  criminal  penalties,  among  others.164  Critically,  CPSIA  created
the  first  comprehensive  and  publicly  available  consumer  incident
database,  which  allows  the  public  to  report  product  hazards  they
have experienced and research others’ reports of harm.165

CPSIA  led  to  some  progress  in  product  safety,  but  issues  persist,
particularly  for  Chinese-made  goods.  After  CPSIA  passed,  product
recalls  trended  down  through  2021.166  Since  2021,  however,  the
number  of  recalls  has  jumped.  Between  2021  and  2023,  the  num-
ber of recalls issued by CPSC increased 47 percent, rising from 219
to  323.167 The  annual  number  of  recalls  for  products  made  in  Chi-
na  also  increased  by  44  percent  over  the  same  period,  from  117  to
168.168  For  well  over  a  decade,  Chinese-made  goods  have  been  the
source of roughly half of all recalls (see Figure 3).169

In  addition  to  recalls,  CPSC  has  a  variety  of  other  tools  to  alert
producers and the public of unsafe products, including notices of vi-
olation (NOVs). An NOV is an official determination by CPSC given
to  a  company  indicating  when  a  mandatory  product  standard  has
been violated.170 While recalls declined between 2009 and 2021, the
number  of  NOVs  trended  up  over  that  time  frame,  especially  for
products  made  in  China  (see  Figure  4).  In  2009,  CPSC  issued  963
NOVs  in  total,  with  645  of  those  notices  issued  for  products  made
in  China.171  By  2023,  total  NOVs  had  risen  to  2,347,  while  NOVs
for  Chinese  products  reached  1,724,  accounting  for  roughly  three-
fourths  of  the  total  NOVs  that  year.172  Since  2009,  Chinese-made
goods  have  consistently  accounted  for  between  60  and  80  percent
of NOVs.173

According to CPSC, in 2019 in the United States, consumer prod-
ucts  (domestically  produced  and  imported)  were  involved  in  50,900
deaths  and  over  36  million  injuries.174  CPSC  estimates  that  con-
sumer  product-related  incidents  cost  the  United  States  $1  trillion
each year, including deaths, injuries, and property damage.175

These  persistent  and  increasing  concerns  regarding  the  safe-
ty  of  consumer  products  from  China  are  driven  in  part  by  rising
e-commerce  imports  bought  from  third-party  sellers. Although  it  is
not  possible  to  draw  a  causal  relationship  between  the  number  of
Chinese-made  goods  entering  the  United  States  and  rising  recall
and  NOV  counts  with  the  data  presented,  it  should  be  noted  that
these trends have occurred against a backdrop of rising e-commerce
shipments  from  China.176  In  a  2019  investigative  report,  the  Wall
Street Journal found 10,870 items for sale on Amazon that had been
declared  unsafe  or  banned  by  federal  regulators  were  deceptively
labeled, or lacked federally required warnings.* 177 Of the 1,934 sell-

* These products were listed between May and August of 2019. After Amazon was informed of the
items, 83 percent of the over 10,000 items listed were taken down or altered as of August 23, 2019.

ers of these goods whose addresses could be determined, 54 percent
were  based  in  China.178  The  true  number  of  China-based  sellers
could be higher, since Chinese producers may list a U.S. reshipping
warehouse  as  their  location,  giving  consumers  the  impression  that
a  good  is  from  a  U.S.  seller.179  China-based  sellers  have  been  con-
sistently linked to unsafe, hazardous, and low-quality products. For
example, in April 2024, CPSC issued a recall for children’s multipur-
pose  helmets  imported  by  the  Chinese  company  Fengwang  Sports
and  sold  exclusively  on  Temu.180  The  helmets  “do  not  comply  with
the  positional  stability,  dynamic  strength  of  retention  system,  im-
pact  attenuation,  and  certification  requirements  in  violation  of  the
CPSC  federal  safety  regulation”  and  can  fail  to  protect  riders  in
the event of a crash.181 In 2023, a similar recall was issued for hel-
mets  produced  and  sold  by  a  Chinese  company  offered  exclusively
through Amazon.182

Direct-to-consumer e-commerce platforms are also leading venues
for Chinese counterfeit goods entering the United States, undermin-
ing U.S. companies’ efforts to provide high-quality and safe goods to
consumers.  According  to  data  published  by  CBP,  China  and  Hong
Kong  are  the  largest  sources  of  counterfeits  entering  the  United
States,  accounting  for  83.6  percent  of  counterfeit  seizures  by  value
in  FY  2023.* 183  Of  the  estimated  $2.76  billion  in  retail  value  of
counterfeits  seized  by  CBP  in  FY  2023,  products  from  China  and
Hong  Kong  totaled  $1.82  billion  and  $488  million,  respectively.† 184
According  to  the  Office  of  the  U.S. Trade  Representative’s  2023  Re-
view  of  Notorious  Markets  for  Counterfeiting  and  Piracy,  China  is
the  number  one  source  of  counterfeit  products  in  the  world.185 The
review  named  multiple  online  platforms,  including Temu’s  Chinese
domestic  counterpart  Pinduoduo  and  physical  market  locations  in
China.186  Daniel  Shapiro,  senior  vice  president  of  brand  relation-
ships  and  strategic  partnerships  at  brand  protection  provider  Red
Points,  testified  before  the  Commission  that  among  e-commerce
platforms,  Chinese  marketplaces  that  ship  internationally  are  by
far  the  largest  source  of  counterfeits;  just  over  85  percent  of  all
China-originated  IPR  infringements  reported  by  Red  Points  came
from  Chinese  e-commerce  platforms  like Alibaba,  DHGate,  JD.com,
Temu,  Shein,  and  AliExpress.187  As  of  February  2024,  Shein  faced
almost  100  cases  of  copyright  infringement  in  the  United  States,
while sellers on Temu have been accused of copying product photos,
descriptions, and even entire Amazon storefronts alongside offering
counterfeit  products.188  Counterfeits  present  significant  economic
harm  to  U.S.  businesses,  costing  them  over  $200  billion  annually
and resulting in the loss of more than 750,000 U.S. jobs.189

* China is the largest source of counterfeits not only the for the United States but also globally.
An  Organisation  for  Economic  Co-operation  and  Development  study  that  compiled  counterfeit
seizure  data  across  countries  found  that  China  and  Hong  Kong  were  the  source  for  the  vast
majority  of  counterfeit  imported  products  between  2017  and  2019.  Organisation  for  Economic
Co-operation  and  Development,  European  Union  Intellectual  Property  Office,  “Global  Trade  in

† Commonly  seized  Chinese-made  counterfeits  include  handbags  and  wallets,  clothing  and  ac-
cessories, and watches and jewelry. Together, these three product categories account for 65 percent
of  all  seized  lines  from  China  and  Hong  Kong  and  81  percent  of  total  seizure  value  from  these
producers. U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Intellectual Property Rights, January 19, 2024.

Due  to  the  illicit  nature  of  these  goods,  counterfeits  can  present
heightened health and safety risks to U.S. consumers.190 In a study
published in 2022, 36 percent of counterfeit apparel items tested by
the American Apparel & Footwear Association failed to comply with
U.S.  product  safety  standards.* 191 Tested  items  were  found  to  con-
tain arsenic, lead, phthalates, and other toxic heavy metals known to
damage kidneys, bones, respiratory systems, and neurological devel-
opment.192  Similarly,  in  2018,  Chinese  counterfeit  cosmetics  seized
from  vendors  in  Los  Angeles  and  Houston  were  found  to  contain
hazardous  materials,  including  lead,  arsenic,  and  human  waste.193
These  dangerous  counterfeit  cosmetics  were  labeled  as  reputable
U.S.  brands,  potentially  misleading  purchasers  into  believing  they
were receiving authentic and safe products.194

Counterfeits  pose  a  more  acute  challenge  for  technical  compo-
nents  that  may  be  hidden  from  U.S.  consumers’  view,  such  as  auto
parts.  In  March  2023,  CBP  seized  nearly  $200,000  in  counterfeit
auto  parts  shipped  from  China,  including  features  vital  to  safely
operating  airbag  covers,  front  fenders,  and  bumpers.195  Counterfeit
materials  have  also  been  discovered  in  commercial  jets.  In  one  in-
stance  uncovered  in  2023,  the  certificates  verifying  the  origin  of  ti-
tanium used to manufacture airplane fuselages were found to have
been forged by a supplier in China.196 In total, CBP seized counter-
feit  automotive  and  aerospace  products  worth  $7.6  million  in  2023,
with  $5.2  million  and  $2.2  million  of  this  originating  in  China  and
Hong Kong, respectively.197 The National Crime Prevention Council
estimates  that  over  350,000  serious  injuries  and  70  deaths  occur
every year due to counterfeit products.198

China  is  a  prominent  source  of  counterfeit  medications,  and  U.S.
households  additionally  face  direct  risks  to  their  health  from  un-
safe  pharmaceuticals  from  China.  In  FY  2023,  CBP  seized  $86.6
million  in  counterfeit  medications  and  personal  care  products  that
originated  in  China  and  Hong  Kong,  accounting  for  47  percent  of
the  total.199  According  to  the  Organisation  for  Economic  Co-opera-
tion  and  Development  (OECD),  China  is  the  world’s  second-largest
source  of  fake  pharmaceuticals  ranging  from  antibiotics  to  cancer
treatments.† 200  China’s  growing  position  in  the  biopharmaceutical
industry  may  enable  Chinese  counterfeiters  to  more  easily  repli-
cate  advanced  drug  discoveries,  undercutting  IP  owners  and  pos-
ing  health  risks  to  U.S.  households.  (For  more  on  China’s  position
in  biopharmaceutical  supply  chains,  see  Chapter  3,  “U.S.-China
Competition in Emerging Technologies.”) For example, in December
2023, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warned of fake
Ozempic, a diabetes drug used to treat obesity, entering the United
States  after  seizing  a  shipment  of  counterfeit  products.201  Though
the FDA has not announced the origin of the fake drugs, an investi-
gative report by Vanity Fair identified a shipment of 10,000 units of
fake Ozempic sent by air mail to the United States from China.202

Challenges  Encountered  by  U.S.  Regulators  with  Imports

from China

The  Volume  of  Imports  from  China  Burdens  Regulators  and

Increases Consumer Risks

U.S.  regulators  are  overwhelmed  by  the  volume  of  imports  from
China  and  a  lack  of  time  and  capacity  required  to  properly  inspect
goods  entering  the  United  States. This  allows  large  numbers  of  po-
tentially unsafe or illicit goods to enter the U.S. market daily. In FY
2022,  CBP  processed  $3.35  trillion  in  imports,  including  more  than
33.4  million  imported  cargo  containers  at  U.S.  ports,  not  including
de  minimis  entries.203  According  to  CBP’s  annual  Trade  and Trav-
el  Report  for  FY  2022,  a  physical  inspection  of  a  cargo  container
takes  120  minutes  on  average,  while  a  technology-aided  nonintru-
sive  inspection  takes  eight  minutes.204  Challenges  with  inspection
times are further compounded by a shortage of staff, particularly for
consumer  products.  There  are  currently  328  ports  of  entry  located
throughout  the  United  States.205  CPSC  has  520  employees,  includ-
ing  120  investigators  and  compliance  officers  located  at  23  ports
with the highest volumes of consumer product imports as of March
2022.206 In testimony before the Commission, Jim Joholske, director
of the Office of Import Compliance for CPSC, noted that the agency
had  “fewer  than  50  investigators  stationed  at  some  of  the  largest
ports  in  the  country”  and  further  assessed  that  “the  sheer  volume
of imports from China remains overwhelming and difficult to moni-
tor.” 207 Given its staffing and resource capacity, CPSC seeks to posi-
tion  its  personnel  to  maximize  the  percentage  of  potentially  unsafe
products  it  screens,  including  by  deploying  additional  resources  to
express courier facilities and international mail facilities.208 (For an
overview  of  U.S.  consumer  product  safety  enforcement  throughout
the import process, see Figure 5.)

Chinese  e-commerce  platforms’  ability  to  take  advantage  of  the
de  minimis  threshold  also  poses  significant  challenges  to  U.S.  im-
port  regulators.  According  to  the  latest  available  data  published
by  CBP,  de  minimis  imports  from  China  increased  from  300  mil-
lion  packages  in  FY  2018  to  nearly  450  million  in  FY  2021—equal
to  58  percent  of  the  United  States’  total  de  minimis  imports  that
year.209  According  to  the  U.S.  International  Trade  Commission,  83
percent  of  total  U.S.  e-commerce  imports  benefited  from  this  exclu-
sion  in  FY  2022.210  Limited  staff  resources  across  U.S.  regulators
and  insufficient  shipment  data  (see  textbox  below)  mean  the  vast
majority  of  these  packages  are  not  inspected  for  compliance  with
U.S.  regulations.  De  minimis  shipments  often  arrive  in  the  United
States via express couriers, consignment, and international mail.211
In  the  first  three  quarters  of  FY  2024,  an  average  of  nearly  four
million  de  minimis  shipments  arrived  in  the  United  States  each
day  from  all  countries.212 According  to  CBP,  in  2022,  80  percent  of
all  IPR-related  shipment  seizures  arriving  from  China  entered  the
United States through international mail and express consignment,
the  same  channels  used  for  shipping  small  e-commerce  packages
directly to consumers.213 In addition, research suggests e-commerce
exporters are exploiting gaps in regulatory coverage for de minimis
shipments to bypass inspections. In a 2019 report, CPSC stated that

“some  industry  stakeholders  indicated  that  due  to  the  small  size
of  their  shipments,  de  minimis  e-commerce  sellers  can  disperse  the
risk of having their products interdicted by various border manage-
ment agencies by sending multiple shipments to different ports.” 215

Limited Data on De Minimis Shipments and Ongoing
Data Pilots

The  United  States  collects  only  limited  data  on  de  minimis
shipments,* posing challenges to identifying unsafe or illegal im-
ports.  Unlike  shipments  entering  through  normal  customs  chan-
nels, CBP does not require de minimis entries to declare the HTS
code  for  the  shipments’  contents,  which  is  used  for  a  variety  of
purposes,  including  assessing  import  duties  and  preparing  U.S.
trade  statistics.  Instead,  these  importers  can  provide  a  “specific”
description  of  the  product,  but  often  these  are  vague,  inaccurate,
and difficult for regulators to process. CBP’s regulations also only
require de minimis importers to provide information on the ship-
per, which is frequently the entity arranging the shipment rather
than the manufacturer of the product.† 216

These data gaps compromise the enforcement of U.S. regulations
and laws. For instance, the lack of HTS data inhibits CPSC from
screening  for  products  subject  to  high  standards,  like  children’s
products,  and  inadequate  data  on  the  manufacturer  prevents
targeting  imports  based  on  risk  factors  such  as  past  violations.
As  Mr.  Joholske  testified, “Without  the  same  data  as  we  have  on
higher value shipments, CPSC cannot utilize its risk assessment
methodology to know what should be targeted for inspection.” 217
These  issues  pose  challenges  to  the  enforcement  of  other  laws,
including the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act.218

To  mitigate  these  issues,  CBP  has  initiated  data  pilots  to  be-
gin  collecting  additional  information  on  de  minimis  imports,  but
participation in these programs remains voluntary. In July 2019,
CBP launched its Section 321 Data Pilot, through which approved
carriers,  brokers,  freight  forwarders,  and  online  marketplaces
could submit additional data on de minimis shipments in advance
to  CBP,  including  data  elements  not  traditionally  collected  like
product images and URL links.219 CBP has extended this pilot to
run through August 2025.220 In August 2019, CBP began the En-
try Type 86 test, which enabled de minimis importers to file entry
releases  electronically  through  the  Automated  Commercial  En-
vironment—CBP’s  online  trade  processing  portal.221  Entry  Type
86  is  intended  to  provide  CBP  and  other  government  agencies
greater visibility into de minimis imports, asking filers to submit
the  shipment’s  ten-digit  HTS  codes,  among  other  expanded  data
elements. This test currently has no sunset date. In its September

* CBP’s  regulations  require  the  following  data  fields  for  a  shipment  to  be  released  under  de
minimis:  “(1)  Country  of  origin  of  the  merchandise;  (2)  Shipper  name,  address  and  country;  (3)
Ultimate  consignee  name  and  address;  (4)  Specific  description  of  the  merchandise;  (5)  Quantity;
(6)  Shipping  weight;  and  (7)  Value.”  U.S.  Customs  and  Border  Protection,  “Form  of  Entry,”  19
CFR 143.23(k).

† In  contrast,  importers  that  file  for  formal  entries  are  required  to  provide  a  “Manufacturing
ID,”  which  is  a  unique  code  for  the  manufacturer  or  entity  initiating  the  shipment.  Fariha  Ka-

Limited Data on De Minimis Shipments and Ongoing
Data Pilots—Continued
13,  2024  announcement  on  its  intent  to  propose  rulemaking  on
the de minimis exemption, the Administration indicated it would
require  additional  data  elements  on  de  minimis  shipments,  in-
cluding  HTS  codes.222  In  FY  2023,  CBP  received  filings  on  785.7
million de minimis shipments through these two programs out of
a total of over one billion de minimis entries.223

Evasion of Regulations and Fraudulent Certification

In  most  cases,  a  permit  or  advanced  inspection  is  not  needed
to  import  goods  into  the  United  States;  in  the  limited  set  of  cases
where  advanced  testing  and  certification  is  required,  these  efforts
are subject to abuse and evasion by Chinese manufacturers.224 Fed-
eral law requires importers to verify some consumer products’ com-
pliance  with  safety  regulations  through  testing,  including  all-ter-
rain  vehicles,  mattresses,  bicycle  helmets,  and  almost  all  children’s
products.225  Producers  of  these  regulated  goods  must  provide  doc-
umentation  of  successful  testing  to  retailers,  distributors,  and—
upon  request—the  government  (for  more  on  the  approval  process
for  third-party  testing  laboratories,  see  textbox  below).226  However,
only  producers  of  children’s  products  are  required  to  use  CPSC-ap-
proved  third-party  labs;  other  products  can  be  tested  in-house  or
by  other  qualified  labs  and  test  facilities  that  do  not  require  CPSC
accreditation.227

Products regulated by other agencies require testing as well. The
U.S.  Department  of  Transportation  regulates  the  shipping  of  lithi-
um-ion batteries, and New York City recently started requiring bat-
teries to certify via labeling that they meet testing requirements.228
However,  these  certifications  can  be  forged,  resulting  in  significant
consequences for U.S. consumers. A 2023 investigation by CBS New
York  found  fake  certification  stickers  for  lithium-ion  batteries  for
sale  on  a  Chinese  e-commerce  marketplace  following  an  e-bike  fire
in  New  York  City.229  The  New  York  City  Fire  Department  stated
that  lithium-ion  batteries  had  been  linked  to  more  than  200  fires
and  17  deaths  in  New  York  City  between  January  and  November
2023.* 230

Issues have arisen with other types of third-party testing as well.
The  FDA  requires  producers  of  medical  devices  to  submit  testing
data on device performance, which is part of a safety review process
that may also include mandatory onsite inspections by the FDA.231
In  February  2024,  the  FDA  issued  a  reminder  for  medical  device
manufacturers  to  independently  verify  third-party-generated  data
after  the  agency  “identified  an  increase  in  submissions  containing
unreliable  data  generated  by  third-party  test  labs,  including  from
numerous  such  facilities  based  in  China  and  India.” 232  The  FDA
encouraged manufacturers to contract testing to accredited labs un-
der  the  Accreditation  Scheme  for  Conformity  Assessment  program,

which is not currently required when testing medical devices.233 The
agency  further  noted,  “When  such  data  are  submitted  to  the  FDA,
the agency is unable to rely on them to grant marketing authoriza-
tion and it calls into question the data integrity of the entire file.” 234

Third-Party Conformity Bodies

In the United States, third-party conformity assessment bodies
must  be  accredited  by  a  signatory  member  to  the  Internation-
al  Laboratory  Accreditation  Cooperation-Mutual  Recognition  Ar-
rangement  (ILAC-MRA),  an  international  framework  that  aims
to  standardize  testing  standards  and  allow  the  cross-border  rec-
ognition  of  labs  accredited  by  a  foreign  accreditation  body.* 235
Third-party  testers  are  also  subject  to  periodic  audits  at  least
every  two  years.236  These  audits  consist  of  a  reassessment  of
the  lab’s  management  and  technical  requirements  by  the  lab’s
accreditation  body  and  an  examination  of  this  documentation  by
CPSC.237 As of October 2024, 292 out of a total of 677 third-par-
ty testing laboratories approved by CSPC were located in China,
and  almost  all  were  accredited  by  the  China  National Accredita-
tion  Service  for  Conformity  Assessment.238  The  majority  of  ac-
cepted  Chinese  testing  labs  are  independently  owned,  but  some
are  also  partially  owned  by  manufacturers,  private  labelers,  or
government entities.239

In  some  cases,  U.S.  regulators  may  conduct  advanced  inspections
of foreign manufacturers to ensure quality production, but these ef-
forts  are  sometimes  undermined  by  a  lack  of  capacity.  While  the
FDA  is  required  to  conduct  mandatory  in-country  inspections  of
overseas  facilities  for  drugs,  medical  devices,  biological  materials,
and  food  products,  it  announced  in  March  2020  that  it  would  stop
routine  inspections  of  overseas  and  domestic  producers  because  of
the  COVID-19  pandemic.240  Due  to  staffing  shortages  and  exacer-
bated  by  a  backlog  in  the  wake  of  the  pandemic,  the  agency  has
since  struggled  to  resume  regular  inspections,  leading  to  increased
risks to U.S. consumers.241 Following a series of deaths from bacte-
ria-tainted  eyedrops,†  a  ProPublica  analysis  of  FDA  data  revealed
that the agency inspected only 6 percent of the approximately 2,800
foreign  manufacturing  facilities  where  drugs  and  their  ingredients
were  produced  in  2022.‡ 242  Even  in  cases  where  the  FDA  is  able
to  inspect  foreign  manufacturers,  there  are  significant  questions

* To  be  accepted  by  CPSC,  labs  must  be  independently  accredited  to  ISO/IEC  17025—General
Requirements  for  the  Competence  of  Testing  and  Calibration  Laboratories  by  a  member  of  the
ILAC-MRA.  Applicants  must  also  detail  the  scope  of  tests  related  to  children’s  product  safety
that  they  intend  to  offer.  The  submission  is  then  reviewed  by  CPSC  upon  initial  acceptance
and  then  audited  at  least  every  two  years  going  forward.  U.S.  Consumer  Product  Safety  Com-

regarding  the  reliability  of  the  information  gathered.  In  February
2024, the GAO released a report in which it concluded that the FDA
faces continued issues in overseeing foreign drug manufacturers due
to persistent staff vacancies, including in the FDA’s China office.243
Of  particular  concern,  the  report  noted  that  the  FDA’s  practice  of
announcing visits up to 12 weeks in advance, as is typically required
by foreign governments, and reliance on translators provided by the
foreign establishment being inspected “can raise questions about the
accuracy of information FDA investigators collect.” 244

Inefficient and Ineffective Recalls

If  unsafe  products  are  not  stopped  at  the  border,  federal  agen-
cies  can  issue  recalls  to  remove  them  from  the  market,  but  the
recall  process  can  be  long,  ineffective,  and  inefficient,  particular-
ly  when  dealing  with  China-based  manufacturers.  Most  recalls
are  voluntary  and  issued  as  the  result  of  negotiations  between
CPSC  and  the  retailer  or  manufacturer.* 245  CPSC  cannot  uni-
laterally  recall  a  product  without  legal  action.246  If  a  company
does  not  agree  to  a  voluntary  recall,  CPSC  must  pursue  a  man-
datory  recall  through  an  administrative  adjudicatory  process  or
by  filing  a  federal  court  action.247  However,  since  U.S.  regulators
cannot  exercise  jurisdiction  over  foreign  firms  to  impose  finan-
cial  consequences,  CPSC  faces  significant  challenges  in  getting
China-based  and  other  foreign  firms  to  comply  with  U.S.  regula-
tions.248 These  firms  can  ignore  communications  from  CPSC  and
refuse to participate in the voluntary recall process, forcing CPSC
to  either  initiate  legal  proceedings  or  else  to  leave  the  product
unrecalled.249  In  testimony  for  the  Commission,  Mr.  Joholske
asserted  that  “CPSC  has  little  ability  to  act  against  third-par-
ty  sellers  who  are  small  manufacturers  based  overseas.  Products
including  baby  mattresses,  lithium  ion  batteries,  magnets,  baby
loungers, and more are left unrecalled because the manufacturer
cannot  be  held  responsible.” 250

In  cases  where  firms  do  not  cooperate,  CPSC  can  issue  a  uni-
lateral  safety  warning  to  alert  the  public  of  a  product’s  risks.251
The number of these warnings has increased in the past four years,
largely in response to unsafe goods sold via e-commerce by Chinese
and other foreign manufacturers.† 252 (For more on the role of e-com-
merce  marketplaces  in  U.S.  consumer  product  safety  enforcment,
see textbox below.) Alongside e-commerce shipments, the number of
unilateral  warnings  issued  by  CPSC  increased  from  three  in  2020
to  38  in  2023.‡ 253  In  remarks  given  at  a  seminar  in  2024,  CPSC
Chair  Alexander  D.  Hoehn-Saric  stated,  “Once  a  rare  occurrence,
these unilateral warnings are now an important part of our toolbox,

months and a few years. Teresa Murray, “Safe at Home 2024,” U.S. PIRG Education Fund, March

† CPSC  cannot  issue  a  recall  for  counterfeit  products,  since  it  does  not  regulate  illegal  goods.
This  inability  to  systematically  remove  unsafe  counterfeits  leaves  large  swaths  of  potentially
dangerous and unregulated consumer goods from China on the market for use by U.S. consumers.

especially for products sold by foreign manufacturers on e-commerce
websites.” 254  These  warnings  primarily  target  goods  made  in  Chi-
na. According to data compiled by the U.S. Public Interest Research
Group’s  Education  Fund,  of  the  38  warnings  issued  by  CPSC  in
2023,  at  least  20  of  the  products  were  manufactured  in  China.255
Most were sold via e-commerce platforms, with four products being
sold on Temu exclusively.* 256 As an example, CPSC issued a public
warning  to  stop  using  baby  loungers  sold  on  several  e-commerce
websites  by  the  Chinese  seller  Poetint002  due  to  suffocation  risk,
fall  hazard,  and  failure  to  comply  with  federal  regulations  for  in-
fant  sleep  products.257  Although  CPSC  notified  Poetint002  that  its
product  violated  the  law,  “the  firm  has  not  agreed  to  recall  these
loungers  or  offer  a  remedy  to  consumers.” 258  Thousands  of  visual-
ly  similar  baby  lounger  products  are  still  available  on  e-commerce
platforms from other sellers.

In  cases  where  companies  comply  with  CPSC  requests  and  an
agreement  for  a  voluntary  recall  is  reached,  low  recall  correction
rates  stymie  efforts  to  remove  unsafe  products  from  the  market.
Examination  of  monthly  progress  reports  on  the  status  of  recalled
items  suggests  that  in  most  cases,  recalls  have  little  success  in  re-
moving  unsafe  goods  from  the  U.S.  market  regardless  of  where  the
product  was  manufactured.  Among  the  27  product  recalls  issued
before  August  1,  2022,  that  CPSC  has  provided  data  on,  19  of  the
products had a correction rate of below 50 percent.259 Among prod-
ucts  recalled  after August  1,  2022,  with  data  available,  only  27  out
of  the  162  recalled  products  had  a  correction  rate  of  50  percent  or
greater.260

Even if a recall is issued and is initially successful, many recalled
products continue to enter and circulate within the United States via
online  retail  sales,  often  involving  Chinese  producers.  In  2007,  the
Federal Government banned the sale of flat pool drain covers due to
numerous drowning and evisceration deaths that were caused when
people—primarily young children—became suctioned to the drain at
the bottom of a pool.† 261 Despite this ban, Chinese sellers continue
to  offer  flat  pool  drain  covers  directly  to  U.S.  consumers  through
online  marketplaces.262  Since  September  2022,  CPSC  issued  seven
recalls on nearly identical drain covers that were in violation of the
federal  safety  standard.263  By  the  time  the  violations  were  detect-
ed,  about  7,300  drains  had  been  sold.264  In  all  seven  instances,  the
drains  were  made  in  China  and  were  being  sold  by  Chinese  com-
panies  directly  to  U.S.  consumers  through Amazon.265 These  recent
recalls  do  not  appear  to  have  solved  the  issue.  Using  an  image  of
the drain cover from one CPSC recall alert in Google’s image search

† In  a  2019  report,  CPSC  stated  that  the  agency  was  aware  of  11  instances  of  circulation  en-

11  instances,  two  resulted  in  death.  Although  sobering,  these  statistics  are  lower  than  earlier
figures. From 1999 to 2008, CPSC reported 83 instances, with 11 reported deaths. U.S. Consum-

E-Commerce Marketplaces’ Role in Product Safety

As commerce has shifted online, CPSC faces new challenges in
upholding product safety rules. Traditionally, physical stores have
played  a  key  role  as  sellers  in  ensuring  the  safety  of  consumer
products. Manufacturers, distributors, and retailers may face civil
liability †  and  regulatory  consequences  for  harms  caused  to  con-
sumers  as  part  of  the  consumer  product  supply  chain.268  CPSC
develops standards for firms involved in the supply chain for con-
sumer products, including retailers in physical stores, and has the
power to ban unsafe products.269 Retailers are expected to obtain
and review certificates of compliance as mandated by CPSC from
manufacturers  and  importers.270  Retailers  must  report  harmful
products to CPSC immediately, ensure the products are no longer
sold  in  their  stores,  and,  in  some  cases,  notify  affected  custom-
ers.271  Regulators  have  the  legal  right  to  enter  and  inspect  the
premises of a seller of consumer goods, which gives them a way to
monitor and enforce these regulations.272 The same laws that ap-
ply to brick-and-mortar stores also apply to retailers, distributors,
and  manufacturers  of  products  sold  online.273  However,  e-com-
merce  marketplaces  have  traditionally  argued  that  they  do  not
qualify  as  “retailers”  or  “distributors”  under  applicable  law  and
instead  cite  the  fact  that  they  only  facilitate  purchases  between
third-party  sellers  and  buyers  without  taking  legal  ownership  of
the product at any point.‡ 274

E-commerce marketplaces may be incentivized to provide addi-
tional consumer protections as a way to compete with other plat-
forms.275  Select  e-commerce  marketplaces  have  policies  in  place
to  remove  recalled  products  from  their  websites.276  Critics  ques-

† Civil  liability  has  played  an  outsized  role  in  holding  firms  accountable  because  consumers
harmed by unsafe products can sue them to recover damages. In May 1997, the non-binding but
influential  Restatement  (Third)  of  Product  Liability  Law  stated  the  typical  legal  approach  that
a person injured by a defective product may sue the manufacturer and members of the chain of
distribution.  The  degree  to  which  retailers  are  civilly  liable,  and  the  legal  standard  required  to
prove  harm,  differ  by  state.  Becca  Trate,  “From  Cart  to  Claim:  Addressing  Product  Liability  in

‡ Under  the  Consumer  Product  Safety Act,  the  term “distributor”  means “a  person  to  whom  a

term does not include a manufacturer or retailer of such product.” The term “third-party logistics

E-Commerce Marketplaces’ Role in Product Safety—
Continued
tion  these  policies,  however,  pointing  to  numerous  instances  of
recalled  products  available  for  purchase  on  e-commerce  market-
places.277 E-commerce marketplaces may enforce additional stan-
dards,  like  requiring  sellers  of  children’s  products  in  the  United
States  to  upload  certificates  of  compliance.278  While  individual
sellers  have  been  liable  for  products  sold  on  marketplaces,  lia-
bility  for  the  marketplaces  themselves  in  transactions  involving
separate  sellers  has  generally  been  limited.279  The  high  volume
of  sellers  with  almost  identical  products,  combined  with  the  fact
that many are overseas beyond the reach of U.S. law enforcement,
makes the rules far more difficult to administer.

In  July  2024,  CPSC  determined  that  Amazon  was  acting  as  a
distributor  for  products  sold  under  the  Fulfillment  by  Amazon
(FBA)  program.280  Such  a  determination  would  make  Amazon
responsible  for  the  safety  of  a  large  portion  of  goods  sold  on  the
platform  by  giving  CPSC  the  ability  to  force  Amazon  to  recall
or  ban  unsafe  products.281  Under  the  FBA  program,  Amazon  is
responsible  for  hosting  the  product  listing  on  its  site,  handling
payment, warehousing, packaging and shipping, returns, and cus-
tomer  service.282  CPSC  initiated  the  complaint  against  Amazon
in  2021  for  failing  to  provide  adequate  notification  and  support
to  customers  after  it  facilitated  the  sale  through  FBA  of  over
400,000 units of “hazardous” products, including “children’s sleep-
wear that fail to meet flammability requirements, carbon monox-
ide detectors that fail to alarm, and hair dryers that lack electro-
cution  protection.” 283  Amazon  argued  that  it  was  merely  acting
as  a  “third-party  logistics  provider,”  which  would  have  shielded
it  from  liability.284  The  CPSC  ruling  reasoned  that  even  though
Amazon  was  not  the  legal  owner  of  the  goods,  the  role  Amazon
played  in  facilitating  the  purchase  went  above  and  beyond  that
of  a  logistics  provider.285  Unless  the  CPSC  ruling  is  overturned,
Amazon  will  be  required  to  update  its  procedures  for  notifying
buyers  about  product  hazards  and  to  provide  refunds  or  replace-
ments for the products.286

The  implications  of  the  ruling  are  still  to  be  determined.  The
ruling  only  applies  to  products  sold  on  Amazon  through  FBA.
The  ruling  is  also  specific  to  Amazon  and  does  not  cover  other
popular e-commerce marketplaces like eBay, Wayfair, Etsy, Shein,
or Temu.287  Different  business  models  like  Shein  and Temu  that
facilitate  direct  shipments  from  product  manufacturers  to  the  fi-
nal  consumer  may  not  share  enough  characteristics  of  FBA  for
a  similar  argument  to  apply.288  Perversely,  this  could  encourage
e-commerce  marketplaces  to  move  toward  the  model  of  allowing
international warehouses or manufacturers to ship directly to the
consumer  to  avoid  liability  under  programs  similar  to  FBA.289
Amazon  plans  to  start  a  similar  service  geared  toward  Chinese
sellers in efforts to compete with Shein and Temu.290 Finally, the
decision  gives  CPSC  the  power  to  enforce  its  regulations  against
Amazon but leaves unresolved the applicability of direct civil lia-
bility for harm to U.S. consumers.291

Case  Study: The  Safety  Risks  and  Health  Hazards

of Low-Quality Toys from China

Children’s  toys  available  for  purchase  in  the  United  States  are
overwhelmingly  sourced  from  China,  giving  China-based  manufac-
turers  an  outsized  role  in  ensuring  the  safety  of  products  available
to  young  U.S.  consumers.  According  to  data  provided  by  the  U.S.
Census  Bureau,  China  is  the  number  one  source  of  imported  chil-
dren’s toys to the United States, accounting for three-quarters of all
toy  imports  in  2023.* 292  Given  the  country’s  substantial  role  as  a
source of imports, China-based manufacturers also play a significant
role in ensuring that toys are produced up to U.S. safety standards.
Children’s products and toys are among the most heavily regulated
goods  in  the  U.S.  market.  All  toys  sold  in  the  United  States  and
intended  for  use  by  children  age  12  and  under  must  be  tested  by
a third-party, CPSC-approved laboratory for  compliance  with  appli-
cable  federal  safety  requirements.293  Upon  successful  completion
of  testing,  the  manufacturer  or  importer  will  issue  a  Children’s
Product  Certificate †  verifying  a  product’s  compliance  with  regu-
lations  based  on  the  lab  results.294  Although  there  may  be  addi-
tional  requirements  for  some  toys,  most  are  subject  to  standards
prescribed  by  the  Standard  Consumer  Safety  Specification  for  Toy
Safety  as  specified  by  the  international  standards-setting  organiza-
tion  ASTM.295  These  standards  cover  provisions  for  toys’  material
quality,  flammability,  toxicology,  and  stability  and  overload  require-
ments,  among  other  features.296  Critically,  U.S.  consumers  cannot
externally  observe  many  of  these  safety  features,  leaving  them  to
depend  on  manufacturers,  importers,  and  retailers  to  appropriately
vet the quality of the products they sell.

Despite these extensive regulations, toys made in China continue
to  present  elevated  health  and  safety  risks  to  U.S.  children.  A  re-
view  of  CPSC  toy  recalls  issued  from  2019  to  2023  reveals  that  85
percent  were  for  products  made  in  China.‡ 297  Of  the  16  lead-  and
phthalate-related  recalls  conducted  in  the  past  five  years,  all  but
one  were  for  products  made  in  China.298  Even  in  cases  where  a
finished toy was not imported from China, toy components manufac-
tured  in  China  still  present  safety  concerns.  In  May  2023,  a  small
U.S.  bike  manufacturer  issued  a  recall  for  an  electric  bike  with  a
built-in  seat  for  young  children.299 Although  the  bike  was  designed

* Part of the decline may be due to some toy sales shifting to cross-border e-commerce channels

that utilize the de minimis exemption, for which the United States collects insufficient data.

† The Children’s Product Certificate must be furnished to CPSC upon request and currently can
be  furnished  electronically  or  physically.  In  practice,  many  importers  and  manufacturers  email
the  certificate  to  CPSC  when  requested. A  new  proposal  by  CPSC  would  change  this  process  to
a  mandatory  e-filing  system  for  foreign  manufacturers  when  the  product  is  imported.  In  a  past
study,  CPSC  found  that  shipments  accompanied  by  a  certificate,  or  where  a  certificate  was  pro-
vided within 24 hours of request, are significantly less likely to violate safety rules than products
for which it took longer than 24 hours to provide the certificate or where no certificate was ever
provided, even after CSPC requested one. No shipments, including de minimis, would be exempt
from the e-filing requirement. CSPC anticipates that requiring e-filing of certificates will improve
its risk assessment methodology and ability to target high-risk shipments for inspection. On Sep-
tember 13, 2024, the Administration announced that CPSC intends to issue a final rule to enact
these  changes.  Sheila  A.  Millar  and  Antonia  Stamenova-Dancheva,  “CPSC  Proposes  Significant
Changes  to  Rule  Governing  Certificates  of  Compliance,”  National  Law  Review,  January  4,  2024;

and  assembled  by  the  small  business,  the  firm  used  yellow-painted
wood panels from China containing levels of lead that exceeded fed-
eral standards.300

Toy  safety  concerns  have  been  exacerbated  by  the  rise  of  Chi-
na-based  e-commerce  sellers  and  Chinese  e-commerce  websites,
which  often  sell  recalled  toys  or  other  children’s  products  with
known safety issues. The continued production and resale of mag-
netic ball sets provides an example of how online sales undermine
consumer  safety.  Magnetic  ball  sets  consist  of  numerous  small,
round, powerful magnets that can be pulled apart or reconnected
to form different shapes. Often sold as a children’s toy, these sets
pose serious health and safety risks if ingested, as the small mag-
nets may connect while inside a person’s body, potentially result-
ing in serious injury or even death.301 More than 2,000 emergen-
cy room visits and at least seven deaths have been linked to these
products  between  2017  and  2021.302  CPSC  issued  a  warning  in
2007 and then again in 2011 after the agency received more than
200  reports  of  children  swallowing  magnets,  with  at  least  18  of
those cases resulting in emergency surgery.303 Between 2012 and
2014,  CPSC  issued  six  recalls  for  magnetic  ball  sets  due  to  inju-
ry  hazard;  the  agency  then  issued  at  least  another  five  between
December 2023 and March 2024, with most of the products being
made in and offered online by China-based sellers.304 In addition
to  these  recalls,  CPSC  has  issued  at  least  21  notices  of  violation
for magnet sets.305 In every case, the sets were sold online, and in
17  of  the  21  instances,  CPSC  identified  the  responsible  company
as  based  in  China.306  Despite  these  well-known  and  documented
risks,  magnet  sets  that  do  not  comply  with  federal  safety  stan-
dards  continue  to  be  sold  into  the  U.S.  market  via  e-commerce
platforms  by  China-based  sellers.

Counterfeit toys from China present  acute risks for  U.S.  consum-
ers,  since  manufacturers  of  these  products  are  unlikely  to  submit
their  fraudulent  goods  to  the  extensive  testing  and  certification
required  by  the  Federal  Government.  Of  the  165  toy-related  coun-
terfeit  shipment  seizures  conducted  by  CBP  in  FY  2022,  133  sei-
zures  were  from  China  or  Hong  Kong.* 307  In  FY  2023,  over  half
of  seized  Chinese  and  Hong  Kong  counterfeit  toy  shipments  were
found  entering  the  United  States  through  express  consignment  or
mail,  venues  commonly  used  for  e-commerce  imports.308  Although
information  on  the  product  safety  of  these  recent  seizures  is  not
available,  past  experience  suggests  these  products  likely  posed  sig-
nificant  risks.  In  2019,  CBP  and  several  other  federal  agencies  and
international partners executed Operation Holiday Hoax, a sting op-
eration to prevent counterfeit goods from entering the United States
and  other  markets.309  After  searching  a  shipment  from  China,  the
joint team recovered 155,000 units of suspected counterfeit toys, lat-
er found to contain lead.310 Counterfeits may pose other hazards as
well,  such  as  inappropriate  age-labeling,  which  may  mislead  con-
sumers into purchasing a toy that carries an added but unidentified
risk for younger children.311

* CBP  reported  the  total  value  of  all  toy-related  seizures  to  equal  $7.2  million.  Of  that  total,
counterfeits  from  China  and  Hong  Kong  accounted  for  $6.3  million  in  value,  or  87  percent.  U.S.

Experiences in Quality Sourcing from China:
Lovevery’s Process

Ensuring  safe  manufacturing  in  China  is  possible,  and  many
U.S. producers and retailers are able to source quality goods from
China  by  implementing  a  rigorous  review  process.  Lovevery,  an
educational play products and toy company headquartered in Boi-
se,  Idaho,  is  one  example  of  a  U.S.  producer  that  is  able  to  effec-
tively  source  from  China  by  implementing  a  quality  and  safety
inspection  process.  A  key  feature  of  this  process  is  testing  con-
ducted  by  multiple  unrelated  parties  at  several  stages  of  manu-
facturing.  This  distribution  of  responsibility  creates  an  informal
check  system  that  holds  all  production  partners  accountable  for
their contribution.

 • Partner  expectations  and  testing:  Lovevery  sets  testing  and
safety  requirements  both  for  its  product  manufacturers  as
well  as  the  suppliers  that  provide  inputs  for  finished  goods.
This  includes  testing  for  chemical  hazards  at  the  supplier
level prior to shipping materials to the manufacturer.312 Sup-
pliers  are  also  expected  to  inspect  and  sometimes  test  com-
ponents and raw materials that enter the factory before they
are used in final assembly.313 Once production begins, Lovev-
ery  implements  in-process  testing  for  items  that  are  critical
to either the quality or safety of the product, providing a sec-
ond layer of review conducted by the manufacturer.314

 • Contracted  audits:  In  addition  to  obtaining  required  product
certifications from CPSC-approved labs, Lovevery works with
contractors to audit China-based factories. These external au-
dits ensure raw materials are compliant with standards and
that  nothing  is  introduced  during  manufacturing  that  may
compromise  the  product’s  quality  or  safety.315  These  audits
allow U.S.-based producers like Lovevery to review the quali-
ty of checks performed by manufacturers and suppliers.

This  inspection  process  reduces  the  likelihood  of  an  unsafe
product reaching the U.S. market,  but it comes at a considerable
cost to U.S. firms—costs not incurred by those China-based man-
ufacturers that sell online directly to U.S.  consumers with no  re-
gard for safety regulations. Bryan Brown, group vice president of
safety, quality, and regulatory compliance for Lovevery, notes that
although critical to the production process for children’s products,
“using  the  right  materials,  adding  extra  steps  in  manufacturing,
building  in  redundancy  for  things  such  as  small  part  contain-
ment  as  well  as  in-process  destructive  testing  drives  a  higher
product  cost.” 316  These  higher  costs  create  opportunity  for  some
unethical  China-based  manufacturers  to  undercut  competition
by  simply  not  following  safety  procedures  or  U.S.  regulations.  In
many instances, these China-based manufacturers will imitate or
attempt  to  entirely  reproduce  goods  sold  by  U.S.  companies.  Mr.
Brown states that “in addition to the obvious issues of intellectual
property  infringement  and  unfair  competition,  these  [knockoff  or
counterfeit]  toys  are  simply  not  made  to  the  same  standard  or,

311

frankly, to any reasonable standard. They are almost always less
expensive and for that reason, consumers likely gravitate to them
for the perceived price value.” 317 Most often, these cheap and un-
safe  goods  are  sold  online  via  third-party  e-commerce  platforms
and  enter  the  United  States  with  limited  if  any  vetting  or  ver-
ification,  presenting  significant  physical  risks  to  U.S.  consumers
and substantial economic harm to U.S. firms.318

Implications for the United States

The  rising  popularity  of  online  shopping  among  U.S.  consumers,
in  part  due  to  the  COVID-19  pandemic  and  the  increasing  use  of
e-commerce  platforms  by  China-based  sellers,  present  a  novel  and
increasing  challenge  to  the  U.S.  import  regulatory  regime.  Online
shopping  platforms  have  given  Chinese  manufacturers  unprece-
dented  access  to  the  U.S.  market,  but  many  of  the  sellers  on  these
sites  are  unaware  of,  unable  to,  or  unwilling  to  produce  up  to  U.S.
regulatory  standards.  Moreover,  since  these  manufacturers  lie  out-
side the jurisdiction of U.S. regulators, courts, and law enforcement,
these  firms  are  not  held  accountable  for  the  unsafe  and  sometimes
deadly  goods  they  sell.  This  combination  of  unfettered  access  and
limited consequences allows China-based sellers to disregard critical
U.S.  safety  regulations.  This  may  lead  to  rising  instances  of  haz-
ardous  products  entering  the  United  States  from  China,  subjecting
unknowing U.S. consumers to a higher likelihood of product-related
mishaps,  injuries,  or  even  death.  In  addition,  by  refusing  to  follow
critical but costly U.S. product safety regulations, unethical Chinese
firms receive an unfair competitive edge vis-à-vis law-abiding firms.
This discrepancy in ability to enforce regulations may result in sig-
nificant  economic  harm  to  U.S.  firms.  Chinese  state-owned  entities
such  as  Sinosure  have  appeared  to  protect  Chinese  producers  of
harmful or poor-quality products from legal or contractual recourse,
underlining how China continues to engage in practices that advan-
tage  its  domestic  firms  and  are  inconsistent  at  least  in  spirit  with
the nondiscrimination obligation central to WTO commitments.

Challenges to enforcement of customs regulations and duties par-
allel  the  difficulties  of  monitoring  product  safety  at  the  border.  As
Chinese  companies  seek  continued  access  to  the  U.S.  market  de-
spite rising trade tensions, U.S. customs authorities may struggle to
monitor  and  penalize  efforts  to  evade  tariffs  and  other  restrictions
on imports. This task may grow more complicated as supply chains
continue adjusting to the evolving bilateral relationship between the
United  States  and  China. With  an  increasing  share  of  U.S.  imports
being  sourced  outside  of  China,  it  may  become  more  difficult  to  de-
tect  instances  of  illegal  transshipment  of  products  from  China.  As
the  volume  of  goods  incoming  from  markets  such  as  Vietnam  and
Mexico increases, U.S. customs authorities may need to deploy addi-
tional  resources  to  ensure  that  Chinese  companies  are  not  seeking
to merely reroute made-in-China products around U.S. trade restric-
tions  or  engage  in  other  forms  of  duty  evasion.  Congress  expanded

312

CBP’s  power  to  investigate  evasion  specifically  of  AD/CVD  orders
through  the  Enforce  and  Protect Act  of  2015,  but  the  agency  lacks
equivalent  authorities  to  investigate  evasion  of  other  duties,  such
as Section 301 tariffs. With the majority of U.S. imports from China
now  subject  to  Section  301  duties,  a  broader  review  of  CBP’s  tools
and  penalties  for  enforcing  U.S.  trade  policy  may  be  merited  given
the potential scale of Chinese duty evasion.

Given  China’s  stated  policy  to  support  its  manufacturing  sectors’
share in the economy, Chinese manufacturers may increasingly use
legitimate  channels  to  remain  intertwined  with  U.S.  global  value
chains.  An  increasing  number  of  Chinese  producers  are  shifting
their  factories  abroad,  where  they  can  produce  for  the  U.S.  market
and  avoid  China-specific  tariffs.  (For  more  on  these  supply  shifts,
see  Chapter  1,  “U.S.-China  Economic  and  Trade  Relations  (Year  in
Review).”)  In  addition,  a  growing  portion  of  China’s  manufacturing
sector  is  engaged  in  producing  inputs  and  components  and  export-
ing  them  for  final  assembly  outside  of  China.  As  downstream  pro-
ducers will continue to face challenges in ensuring Chinese import-
ed  components  comply  with  safety  and  regulatory  standards,  this
could  create  new  risk  vectors  for  U.S.  businesses  and  households
that  are  difficult  to  uncover.  U.S.  households  purchasing  products
from factories in Mexico, Vietnam, and elsewhere that utilize inputs
from China may not be aware of the enhanced safety risk. U.S. agen-
cies will need to continually develop and deploy updated assessment
tools and techniques to ensure parts, components, and materials em-
bedded in key U.S. imports do not raise safety or trade law evasion
concerns.

Notes

The $50 threshold is for shipments
from countries outside of United
States-Mexico-Canada Agreement
(USMCA). For shipments from Canada
and the United States the threshold is
$117.

The $15 threshold is for shipments
from outside of USMCA. For shipments
from Mexico and the United States, the
threshold is $150.

The de minimis threshold varies by
harmonized system codes; some imports
are dutiable under the $140 de minimis
value.

The $150 threshold is the general de
minimis threshold. For shipments from
the United States, the threshold is
$200.

India does not support a de minimis
exemption. All imports are subject to
duty and tax.

Brazil’s de minimis exemption applies
only to postal shipments to individu-
als. In June 2024, Brazil introduced a
20 percent tax on e-commerce imports
valued under $50.

COMPETITION AND CONFLICT

CHAPTER 5: CHINA AND THE MIDDLE EAST

Abstract

The Middle East is a region of strategic importance to China due
to  its  energy  resources,  location  astride  key  trade  routes,  and  pos-
sible receptivity to Chinese efforts to construct an alternative, illib-
eral  world  order.  As  China  has  deepened  its  trade  and  investment
interests  in  the  Middle  East  over  the  past  decade,  it  has  also  built
a variety of diplomatic partnerships and sought to present itself as
a  neutral  arbiter  of  regional  disputes  while  expanding  its  military
activity  in  the  region.  Chinese  engagement  with  the  Middle  East
is  selective  and  transactional,  focused  on  advancing  its  own  inter-
ests;  Beijing  appears  to  have  little  desire  to  play  a  significant  role
in  advancing  regional  security  or  to  meaningfully  contribute  to  a
resolution  of  ongoing  disputes,  including  the  recent  Israel-Hamas
war. Instead, China appears content for the moment to free-ride on
the U.S. and allied regional security infrastructure—including, most
recently,  the  defense  of  maritime  shipping  from  Houthi  attacks—
while  blaming  the  United  States  for  promoting  instability.  China
also works to undermine U.S. ties with key Middle Eastern partners
while supporting adversarial countries like Iran. Chinese strategists
likely also assess that the turmoil in the Middle East deflects a por-
tion  of  U.S.  attention  and  resources  away  from  the  Indo-Pacific.  In
the  short  run,  China  benefits  from  its  relationships  in  the  Middle
East  focused  on  energy  trade  and  securing  infrastructure  contracts
for  its  state-owned  enterprises.  In  the  long  term,  Beijing  aims  to
expand  market  share  for  renewable  energy  and  high-value  exports,
gain  supporters  in  its  bid  for  global  leadership,  and  potentially  es-
tablish new outposts capable of supporting its military for increased
power projection. China’s involvement in the Middle East thus pres-
ents  U.S.  policymakers  with  an  array  of  economic,  normative,  and
geopolitical challenges.

Key Findings

 • China’s engagement with the Middle East has expanded during
the tenure of General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Par-
ty (CCP) Xi Jinping and is driven partly by deepening strategic
rivalry  with  the  United  States.  In  contrast  to  the  Indo-Pacific,
where  China  clearly  seeks  to  displace  the  United  States  and
consolidate  a  position  as  the  dominant  power,  the  Middle  East
is  a  region  Chinese  leaders  view  as  a  source  of  intractable  se-
curity challenges and value primarily for its resources and eco-

(333)

334

nomic potential. While China does not have the willingness and
ability  to  replace  the  United  States  as  a  major  contributor  to
regional security, it is nonetheless eager to instrumentalize the
region  in  its  efforts  to  construct  a  new,  illiberal  world  order  at
the United States’ expense. China offers the region’s autocratic
governments  a  vision  of  a  new  regional  security  architecture
under  the  Global  Security  Initiative  and  is  deepening  its  dip-
lomatic  relations  with  U.S.  partners  and  adversaries  alike  to
erode Washington’s influence.

 • Beijing’s  reaction  to  the  Israel-Hamas  war  has  illustrated  both
the  limits  of  its  diplomatic  influence  in  the  Middle  East  and
its willingness to exploit regional tensions for geopolitical gain.
China has played no significant role in the U.S.- and Arab-facil-
itated  negotiations  between  Israel  and  Hamas,  having  lost  its
credibility  as  a  neutral  actor  by  refusing  to  directly  condemn
the  terrorist  group  for  the  October  7th  attacks.  It  has  not  con-
tributed  to  coalition  efforts  to  protect  maritime  shipping  from
Houthi attacks, and in contravention of international maritime
law  and  norms  it  has  declined  to  use  its  naval  ships  deployed
in  the  region  to  respond  to  distress  signals  from  non-Chinese
vessels. Rather, Beijing has sought to appeal to Arab states and
burnish its image as the self-declared leader of what it calls the
“Global  South”  by  portraying  itself  as  an  ardent  supporter  of
Palestinian  national  liberation  and  condemning  Israel  and  the
United States as oppressors.

 • China  is  the  largest  trading  partner  for  many  countries  in  the
region,  with  growth  in  total  trade  and  direct  investment  be-
tween China and the Middle East outpacing that of China with
the rest of the world over the past five years. While China ben-
efits from infrastructure contracts and expanding market share
for its exports to the region, its principle economic objective re-
mains  securing  steady  flows  of  energy  resources,  with  between
40 and 50 percent of China’s total imported energy coming from
the region.

 • China  and  Iran  have  a  similar  interest  in  opposing  the  U.S.-
led  rules-based  international  order,  but  the  relationship  is  to
a  large  degree  one  of  convenience.  Just  as  it  is  using  Russia’s
diplomatic isolation to extract favorable terms on energy deals,
China is opportunistically leveraging its consumption market to
purchase  discounted  oil  from  Iran  while  going  to  great  lengths
to  avoid  the  appearance  of  sanctionable  transactions  through
the use of smaller purchases and shell companies.

 • China’s  military  activities  in  the  Middle  East  advance  its  eco-
nomic  interests  while  allowing  the  People’s  Liberation  Army
(PLA) to gain operational experience and lay the foundation for
a more robust future military presence.

 • China is emerging as a global competitor in niche sectors of the
Middle  Eastern  arms  market.  China  is  crucial  to  the  develop-
ment  of  the  Iranian  drone  industry. Although  the  U.S.  Depart-
ment  of  the  Treasury  and  the  Department  of  Commerce  have
placed  sanctions  on  a  number  of  Chinese  companies,  Chinese

335

actors  are  crucial  to  supplying  components  that  enable  Iran  to
build drones, which it sells to Russia and to its Middle Eastern
proxies  such  as  the  Houthis.  China  continues  to  either  directly
or indirectly provide regional actors with technologies that con-
travene its voluntary but non-binding commitment to adhere to
the  Missile  Technology  Control  Regime  (MTCR).  This  includes
Chinese  state-owned  enterprises  and  non-state  actors’  contin-
ued occasional and covert role in supplying Iran’s ballistic mis-
sile program.

 • The  Gulf  is  emerging  as  a  new  arena  in  U.S.-China  technology
competition,  with  concerns  that  close  ties  between  sanctioned
Chinese entities and technology firms in the region may be facil-
itating transfer of leading-edge technology subject to U.S. export
controls. Countries and companies in the Gulf may be compelled
to  choose  between  technology  infrastructure  and  partnerships
with  China’s  tech  ecosystem  or  those  with  the  United  States
and  its  allies.  Increased  deployment  of  Chinese-made  surveil-
lance  technology  is  also  a  point  of  concern  given  its  potential
to enhance suppression tactics commonly used by authoritarian
governments.

Recommendations
The Commission recommends:

 • Congress  direct  the  Office  of  the  Director  of  National  Intel-
ligence  to  produce  and  provide  to  the  U.S.  Department  of
the  Treasury  within  six  months  a  detailed  study  of  Chinese
purchases  of  Iranian  oil  over  the  span  of  the  last  five  years.
The  study  shall  include  analysis  of  China’s  use  of  transship-
ment points and shell companies as methods to insulate itself
from  sanctions.  Congress  should  further  direct  that  within
six  months  of  receipt  of  the  study,  the Treasury  Department
must  make  a  determination  if  sanctionable  activity  is  occur-
ring  and  report  its  findings  to  Congress.

 • Congress direct the U.S. member on the International Maritime
Organization  (IMO)  Council  to  use  their  voice  and  vote  to  re-
quire  China  to  abide  by  its  treaty  obligations  under  the  IMO
conventions,  including  by  upholding  safety  regulations  on  the
use of Automatic Identification System transponders.

Introduction

In March 2023, media reporting claimed that China had success-
fully  brokered  an  agreement  between  Iran  and  Saudi  Arabia  to
restore  diplomatic  relations,  ending  a  seven-year  dispute  between
bitter rivals and fueling speculation that Beijing could someday re-
place the United States as chief peacemaker and predominant pow-
er in the Middle East.1 Chinese officials were quick to hail their role
in  the  talks,  portraying  the  deal  as  a  model  for  resolving  “hotspot
issues”  and  a  major  victory  for  General  Secretary  Xi’s  Global  Se-
curity  Initiative.2  The  events  set  in  motion  by  Hamas’s  attack  on
Israel  in  October  2023  shattered  this  narrative,  however,  revealing
China’s unwillingness to involve itself in a high-stakes regional cri-
sis or bear the costs of contributing to security for the wider region.

This  chapter  evaluates  the  nature  and  extent  of  China’s  engage-
ment  with  Middle  Eastern  countries.*  It  first  examines  China’s  ob-
jectives toward and views of the region before surveying China’s en-
gagement with Middle Eastern partners in the diplomatic, economic,
technology,  and  military  realms.  It  concludes  with  implications  for
the  United  States.  This  chapter  draws  on  the  Commission’s  April
2024  hearing  on  “China  and  the  Middle  East,”  consultations  with
experts, and open source research and analysis.

China’s  Diplomatic  Activities  in  the  Middle  East:
Wide, Varied, and Designed to Enhance Beijing’s
Influence

China’s  economic  engagement  with  the  Middle  East  region  has
been  growing  since  the  opening-up  and  reform  era  of  the  late
1970s,  but  the  diplomatic  and  security  aspects  of  its  engagement
have deepened significantly over the past decade. During the Mao
era,  China  supported  the  national  liberation  movements  of  Arab
countries,  as  well  as  the  Palestinian  cause,  but  ties  were  lim-
ited  as  China  turned  largely  inward  in  the  1960s  and  1970s.3
In  the  late  1970s,  Deng  Xiaoping’s  reforms  laid  the  foundation
for  expanding  economic  relations  with  Middle  Eastern  countries,
with  total  two-way  goods  trade  between  China  and  the  region
rising  from  $3  billion  in  1992  to  $444.2  billion  in  2023.4  Xi  has
expanded  China’s  footprint  in  the  region  during  his  tenure,  par-
ticularly  by  recruiting  Middle  Eastern  states  as  partners  for  his
signature initiatives. For example, 21 Arab states, along with the
Arab League, have formally signed onto the Belt and Road Initia-
tive (BRI), 17 Arab states have endorsed Xi’s Global Development
Initiative,  15  have  become  members  of  the  Asian  Infrastructure
Investment  Bank,  and  14  have  participated  in  the  China-Arab
Cooperation  Initiative  for  Data  Security.† 5  In  his  written  testi-
mony  before  the  Commission,  Jonathan  Fulton,  an  associate  pro-
fessor  at  Zayed  University  and  nonresident  senior  fellow  at  the
Atlantic Council, assessed that “all in all, Chinese diplomacy has
been highly active and quite successful laying the groundwork for
a  deeper  presence  in  the  Middle  East.” 6

China  has  developed  a  broad  and  systematic  diplomatic  ap-
proach  to  the  Middle  East,  utilizing  a  variety  of  bilateral  and
multilateral  formats  for  engagement.7  Beijing  defines  its  diplo-
matic  relationships  using  different  types  of  partnerships,  which
Chinese scholar Xiang Haoyu, a research fellow at the Ministry of
Foreign  Affairs-affiliated  think  tank  China  Institute  of  Interna-
tional  Studies,  asserts  can  be  flexibly  adapted  to  the  counterpart
country’s conditions and needs (see Table 1).8 China has bilateral
diplomatic relations with all Middle Eastern countries, which in-
clude comprehensive strategic partnerships at the top level of the

* Although the “Middle East” is a broad term often used to encompass North Africa, the Caucus-
es, and South and Central Asia, this chapter will primarily, but not exclusively, focus on China’s
relations  with  the  following  countries:  Bahrain,  Egypt,  Iran,  Iraq,  Israel,  Jordan,  Kuwait,  Leba-
non, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, and Yemen.

† Xi’s  first  diplomatic  tour  of  the  region  took  place  in  January  2016;  he  arrived  first  in  Saudi
Arabia and then traveled to Egypt and Iran. During the visit, China inked Comprehensive Stra-
tegic  Partnership  agreements  with  both  Iran  and  Saudi Arabia.  Jonathan  Fulton, “Friends  with
Benefits:  China’s  Partnership  Diplomacy  in  the  Gulf,”  Project  on  Middle  East  Political  Science,

diplomatic  hierarchy,  followed  by  strategic  partnerships,  friendly
cooperative partnerships, and an “innovative comprehensive part-
nership” with Israel exclusively.9 At the multilateral level, China
uses  the  China-Arab  States  Cooperation  Forum  (CASCF),  made
up  of Arab  League  members,  and  the  Forum  on  China-Africa  Co-
operation,  which  includes  nine  Arab  League  members,  to  map
out cooperation priorities with regular ministerial-level meetings
as  well  as  sub-ministerial-level,  issue-specific  working  groups.10
China  also  plays  an  influential  role  in  BRICS  and  the  Shanghai
Cooperation Organization (SCO), which have both admitted Mid-
dle  Eastern  states  as  members  in  recent  years.* 11  (For  more  on
China’s activities in BRICS and the SCO in 2024, see Chapter 2,
“U.S.-China  Security  and  Foreign Affairs  (Year  in  Review).”)

China  also  conducts  diplomatic  engagement  on  specific  regional
issues through the appointment of special envoys. Beijing appointed
its  first  special  envoy  on  the  Middle  East  Issue  focused  on  Israel
and  Palestine  in  2002  and  a  special  envoy  on  the  Syrian  issue  in
2016.13  Dr.  Fulton  assesses  that  the  envoys  are  designed  to  pres-
ent  China “as  an  actor  with  influence  and  interest  in  these  issues,
although  the  impact  of  each  has  been  marginal.” 14  For  example,  in
October 2023, Special Envoy Zhai Jun embarked on a tour aimed at
promoting peace talks between Israel and Hamas.15 Dr. Fulton said
the  visit  was  intended  primarily  to “demonstrate  China’s  solidarity
with Arab  causes”  and  promote  an  alternative  vision  for  the  region
from that offered by the United States.16 As of this writing, however,
neither the envoy nor China’s mediation efforts have contributed to
any substantive progress on talks between the two sides.17

* According  to  Dr.  Fulton’s  written  testimony  before  the  Commission,  BRICS  expanded  for  the
first  time  in  2023  to  include  Saudi  Arabia,  Egypt,  Iran,  the  UAE,  and  Ethiopia,  providing  the
organization  with  a  presence  in  the  Middle  East  and  North  Africa  (MENA)  and  Horn  regions,
while the SCO admitted Iran in the same year. Bahrain, Egypt, Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and
the  UAE  are  all  dialogue  partners  of  the  SCO  but  are  still  not  full  members.  Jonathan  Fulton,

China’s Interests in and Views of the Middle East

China  has  varied  economic  and  strategic  interests  in  the  Middle
East.  In  terms  of  economic  goals,  China  seeks  access  to  resources
and markets across the region, buying energy, increasing trade, and
winning  infrastructure  construction  contracts.18  According  to  writ-
ten testimony before the Commission by Dawn C. Murphy, an asso-
ciate  professor  at  the  U.S.  National  War  College,  Beijing’s  broader
diplomatic aims in the region include ensuring silence or supportive
statements  from  Arab  states  on  Beijing’s  actions  in  Xinjiang  and
Hong Kong, garnering support for China’s stance on Taiwan and the
South China Sea, and promoting Xi’s signature initiatives like BRI,
the  Global  Development  Initiative,  and  the  Global  Security  Initia-
tive.19 China views the Middle East as part of a broader vision of a
new global order that is led by China and safe for illiberal, author-
itarian regimes like itself.20 China’s engagement with Middle East-
ern  countries  is  illustrative  of  its  broader  effort  to  counterbalance
the  United  States  and  position  itself  as  the  leader  of  a  new  world
order  based  on  its  state-centered,  authoritarian,  self-proclaimed  al-
ternative to Western liberalism.21

China  has  sought  to  appeal  to  Middle  Eastern  governments  on
the  basis  of  its  values,  which  are  framed  as  promoting  sovereignty,
territorial  integrity,  self-determination,  and  noninterference  in  the
domestic  affairs  of  states  rather  than  the  liberal  norms  of  democ-
racy,  free  markets,  human  rights,  and  international  institutions.22
According to Dr. Fulton, by making these non-democratic values the
normative framework of its global initiatives, China has created an
attractive  option  for  “governments  and  societies  long  frustrated  by
the  inconsistent  promotion  of  liberal  values  from  the  west,  or  by
those  that  reject  liberalism  altogether.” 23  For  example,  China’s  re-
action to the Israel-Hamas war—and in particular its support of the
Palestinian cause and condemnation of Israel as an extension of the
United  States—has  also  been  designed  to  reinforce  its  identity  as
the leader of what it refers to as the “Global South.” 24 (For more on
China’s  usage  of  the  term “Global  South,”  see  Chapter  2, “Security
and Foreign Affairs (Year in Review)”)

However,  China  does  not  appear  to  wish  to  take  up  the  U.S.  role
of  major  security  contributor  or  build  a  network  of  alliances  in  the
Middle East.25 According to Yun Sun, director of the China Program
at the Stimson Center, China instead envisions a new system in the
Middle East that would “displace U.S. dominance without replacing
it.” 26  China  views  the  Middle  East  as  an  arena  of  strategic  com-
petition  with  the  United  States,  where  its  increased  engagement
will facilitate the rise of an illiberal world order and accelerate the
decline  of  U.S.  influence.  Jon  B.  Alterman,  director  of  the  Middle
East Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies,
asserts  that  Beijing  is  seeking  to  “peel  the  region  away  from  the
United States.” 27 At the same time, Dr. Alterman notes that China’s
“spectacular absence” of diplomatic engagement on Arab and Israe-
li  issues,  Red  Sea  navigation,  and  other  issues  where  Beijing  has
equities “is a sign that China’s not replacing [the United States] in
the Middle East and doesn’t want to play a larger role.” 28 Dr. Fulton
articulates  that  China’s  economic  interests  in  the  region  have  not
required  a  corresponding  political  or  security  role,  and  Beijing  has

339

shown  no  indication  that  it  will  do  so,  instead  benefiting  from  the
“U.S. security architecture that underpins the region’s fragile status
quo.” 29

Finally,  China  continues  to  view  the  Middle  East  as  a  source  of
instability  and  intractable  security  challenges,  which  it  is  not  nec-
essarily willing or able to resolve. Chinese experts and analysts as-
sess the region as one  of frequent crises, including  conflict between
Israel  and  its  neighbors,  terrorism,  political  movements  for  democ-
ratization such as the Arab Spring, and potential threats to China’s
energy  imports.30  China  has  also  blamed  the  United  States  for  the
region’s  security  problems,  most  recently  asserting  that  Washing-
ton’s  support  for  Israel  in  its  war  with  Hamas  has  been  a  destabi-
lizing force.31

Consistent with these interests and concerns, Chinese diplomatic
activities in the Middle East can be divided into three lines of effort
that  will  be  explored  in  the  following  pages. The  first  is  advancing
Chinese global leadership. The second is undermining U.S. relations
with  key  Middle  Eastern  partners,  notably  Saudi  Arabia  and  the
UAE.  The  third  is  supporting  U.S.  adversaries,  with  a  particular
focus on Iran.

Building  Middle  Eastern  Support  for  Chinese  Global

Leadership

The  Middle  East  has  become  an  important  arena  for  the  CCP  to
advance  its  vision  of  a  new  China-led  global  order.  A  major  aspect
of this effort is China’s increasing efforts to portray itself as a neu-
tral mediator in regional conflicts. In addition, China is heavily pro-
moting Xi’s three major initiatives—the Global Development, Global
Security,  and  Global  Civilization  Initiatives—as  the  framework  for
implementing  this  bid  for  global  leadership.  Finally,  China  engages
the  Middle  East  through  multinational  Beijing-led  venues  such  as
the CASCF.

China Attempts to Paint Itself as a Responsible, Neutral Party

in Mediation Efforts

Beijing’s  push  to  position  itself  as  a  conflict  mediator  in  the
Middle  East  is  part  of  a  larger  strategy  to  portray  itself  as  a
global leader, although the effectiveness of these efforts is debat-
able.32  According  to  Dr.  Murphy,  China’s  efforts  to  mediate  dis-
putes  in  the  region  are  not  new,  but  Beijing  has  recently  shown
a “willingness to publicize its behavior” and may encroach on the
United States’ regional interests.33 China’s role in the Saudi Ara-
bia-Iran  rapprochement  could  be  seen  as  a  significant  win  for
China,  but  according  to  Dr.  Fulton,  most  of  the  groundwork  was
already laid before Beijing’s involvement, and the rapprochement
itself was the result of domestic political and economic pressures
within  Saudi Arabia  and  Iran.* 34

* China’s  hosting  of  the  final  round  of  negotiations  emerged  from  Xi’s  December  2022  state
visit to Riyadh and a subsequent visit by Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi to Beijing in February
2023, although Oman and Iraq had played a major role in prior rounds of negotiation, hosting five
previous  rounds  of  talks.  The  National, “Years  of  Secretive Talks  behind  Saudi-Iran  Rapproche-
ment,” March 10, 2023; Jonathan Fulton, “Iran’s Economic Future Is Uncertain. It’s No Surprise

The  Israel-Hamas  War  and  the  Limits  of  China’s  Mediation

Diplomacy

In  the  decade  leading  up  to  the  current  conflict  between  Hamas
and  Israel,  Beijing  sought  to  balance  its  relations  with  both  sides
and  paint  itself  as  a  neutral  party,  but  ultimately  it  demonstrated
its limited approach through hollow rhetoric. In 2013, China offered
a proposal for a two-state solution during nearly simultaneous sep-
arate  meetings  with  Israeli  Prime  Minister  Benjamin  Netanyahu
and  Palestinian  President  Mahmoud  Abbas  in  Beijing.35  At  the
time,  Yitzhak  Shichor,  a  professor  of  political  science  and  Asian
studies  at  the  University  of  Haifa,  criticized  China’s  vague  propos-
al,36 asserting that “it’s not really a plan, just a collection of slogans
trying  to  satisfy  everybody.” 37  During  2017,  China  again  met  with
President Abbas and hosted the first Palestinian-Israeli Peace Sym-
posium  since  2006.38  In  2021,  Foreign  Minister  Wang  Yi  raised  a
repackaged peace plan at the UN and during state visits to Middle
Eastern countries, which continued to be used as a high-profile and
rhetorical framing opportunity rather than an actionable proposal.39
In April  2023,  just  a  month  after  China’s  efforts  to  broker  a  peace
deal between Saudi Arabia and Iran, then Chinese Foreign Minister
Qin  Gang  held  two  separate  phone  calls  with  his  Israeli  and  Pal-
estinian  counterparts  offering  to  facilitate  peace  talks  between  the
two  sides.40  In  a  further  attempt  to  boost  Beijing’s  standing  in  the
region,  China  signed  a  strategic  partnership  agreement  with  Pal-
estinian  Authority  President  Mahmoud  Abbas  during  a  June  2023
meeting,  which  included  an  economic  and  technological  cooperation
pact, a deal on mutual visa exemption for diplomatic passports, and
the  establishment  of  a  diplomatic  friendship  between  the  Chinese
city of Wuhan and Ramallah.41 At a time of comparatively strained
relations between Israel and the United States, Prime Minister Ne-
tanyahu announced during a June 2023 meeting with U.S. members
of  Congress  that  China  had  invited  him  to  travel  to  Beijing.42 The
trip, originally planned for October 2023, was canceled after the out-
break of war in Gaza.43

Beijing’s  response  to  Hamas’s  October  7th  terrorist  attack  dam-
aged over a decade of relationship-building with Israel and exposed
its  cynical  use  of  the  conflict  to  align  itself  with  Arab  countries  at
the  expense  of  Israel  and  its  people.44  Moreover,  Beijing’s  response
to  the  attack  has  also  been  intended  to  burnish  its  image  as  the
self-declared leader of low- and middle-income countries—countries
it  increasingly  refers  to  as  the  “Global  South”—and  further  its  ri-
valry  with  the  United  States.45  Dr.  Fulton  argues  that  Beijing’s
response  to  events  since  the  October  7th  Hamas  terrorist  attack
have  made  China  appear  transactional  and  self-interested  rather
than  evoking  an  image  of  a  responsible  extra-regional  power.46  On
October  8th,  China’s  foreign  ministry  initially  issued  a  statement
that  called  on  “relevant  parties  to  remain  calm,  exercise  restraint
and  immediately  end  the  hostilities,”  failing  to  place  the  onus  of
responsibility  on  Hamas  for  the  attacks.47  The  following  day,  Chi-
nese  foreign  ministry  spokesperson  Mao  Ning  expressed  sympathy
for the victims but still failed to condemn Hamas.* 48 Spokesperson

* On  October  13th,  Israel’s  foreign  ministry  expressed “deep  disappointment”  to  China’s  envoy
to  the  Middle  East  over  Beijing’s  lack  of  a  clear  and  unequivocal  condemnation  of  Hamas.  Re-

341

Mao’s  initial  statement  was  made  at  the  same  time  a  U.S.  biparti-
san congressional delegation of six senators met with Xi in Beijing,
during  which  time  the  delegation  urged  China  to  issue  a  stronger
condemnation  of  the  attack.49  Minister  Wang  called  for  solidarity
among  Muslim  countries  in  a  call  to  the  Iranian  foreign  minister
just days later.* 50 Wang said in an October 15th call with his Saudi
counterpart that Israel’s actions in Gaza went “beyond the scope of
self-defense,” criticizing the actions as “collective punishment.” 51 On
October  23,  2023,  Wang  Yi  spoke  separately  with  high-level  diplo-
mats  from  Israel  and  the  Palestinian  Authority,  reportedly  stating
that Israel’s “reasonable security concerns” could only be addressed
though a political settlement and expressing sympathy for the peo-
ple of Palestine while failing to condemn Hamas by name.† 52 In No-
vember 2023, China convened a special meeting of BRICS, attended
by  Xi,  to  discuss  the  Israel-Hamas  war.‡ 53  During  the  March  2024
National People’s Congress and Chinese People’s Political Consulta-
tive Conference, also known as the Two Sessions, Minister Wang told
a reporter that China supported full UN membership for Palestine,
taking  a  subtle  jab  at  the  United  States  by  calling  for  “individual
Security  Council  members  to  refrain  from  placing  obstacles  in  its
way.” 54 Dr. Murphy asserts that Beijing has utilized its presence in
the UN Security Council (UNSC) to further this aim, stating that “it
is  likely  Beijing’s  position  on  the  Israel-Hamas  war  and  its  UNSC
voting  on  this  issue  will  positively  resonate  with  the  Arab  World,
the Muslim-majority world, and many countries in the Global South
more broadly.” 55

In subsequent months, China has focused on promoting intra-Pal-
estinian  unity  and  has  also  held  meetings  with  Israel  that  do  not
appear  to  have  created  any  discernible  outcomes  for  advancing  a
resolution  to  the  conflict.56  In  March  2024,  Chinese  diplomat Wang
Kejian made a multi-stop trip to the Middle East, meeting with rep-
resentatives  from  the  Israeli  Foreign  Ministry  and  Palestinian Au-
thority,  followed  by  a  meeting  in  Qatar  with  Hamas  political  chair-
man  Ismail  Haniyeh  (since  killed  while  in  Iran).57  In  April  2024,
China hosted Hamas and Fatah officials, two rival factions, for talks
aimed  at  intra-Palestinian  reconciliation,  a  follow-up  to  meetings

ter  Wang  Yi  stating  in  a  call  with  his  Iranian  counterpart  that  Iran’s  attack  was  a  limited  act

raeli Ambassador  to  China  Irit  Ben-Abba Vitale  to  discuss  the  con-
flict;  then,  in  June  2024,  the  two  exchanged  views  on  China-Israel
relations  and  “international  and  regional  issues  of  mutual  interest
and  concern.” 59  Further  rounds  of  talks  between  Palestinian  fac-
tions  were  held  in  Beijing  in  July  2024,  in  which  14  groups  signed
what  was  dubbed  the  “Beijing  Declaration,”  agreeing  to  recognize
unity  under  the  framework  of  the  Palestine  Liberation  Organiza-
tion, a nationalist umbrella organization composed of disparate fac-
tions that represents the Palestinians at international fora.60 How-
ever,  experts  doubt  that  this  reconciliation  in  preparation  for  the
post-war  rebuilding  of  Gaza  represents  the  end  of  the  rivals’  deep
divisions given the statement’s lack of a follow-up plan.61

Beijing  Cultivates  Middle  Eastern  Support  for  Chinese

Initiatives  and  Global  Leadership

China  is  utilizing  Xi’s  foreign  policy  frameworks—the  Global  Se-
curity  Initiative,  the  Global  Development  Initiative,  and  the  Global
Civilization Initiative—in diplomacy with Middle Eastern countries
to  cultivate  support  for  Chinese  leadership  in  matters  of  security,
development, and culture.62 Beijing has worked to attach the initia-
tives  to  various  projects  in  order  to  advance  their  implementation
across the Middle East. It is not clear how effective these initiatives
have  been  in  the  region;  Dr.  Fulton  says  that  although  the  three
initiatives have been appearing in joint communiques across the re-
gion and have been cited by local actors as useful contributions from
China,  they  do  not  appear  to  be  widely  understood  yet,  and  many
local governments are not aware of them.63

Global Security Initiative

The  Global  Security  Initiative  was  first  introduced  by  Xi  in  an
April  2022  speech  at  the  Boao  Forum  and  described  as  a  proposal
to address “deficits in peace, development, security, and governance”
through  adherence  to  six  core  concepts  and  principles  that  reflect
China’s  preferences  for  regime  security  and  state  sovereignty.* 64
According to M. Taylor Fravel, a professor of political science at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, China is utilizing the initia-
tive  to  criticize  and  discredit  the  United  States  and  its  alliances,
opening  up  space  for  Chinese-led  alternatives.65  Sheena  Chestnut
Greitens,  an  associate  professor  at  the  University  of Texas  at Aus-
tin, sees the Global Security Initiative as the externalization of Xi’s
Comprehensive  National  Security  Concept  and  an  effort  to  “create
new  forms  of  global  security  governance  that  bypass  or  reduce  the
importance  of  the  U.S.  alliance  system,  thereby  blunting  Washing-
ton’s  ability  to  contain  China  or  foment  ‘color  revolutions’  inside
it.” 66  (For  more  on  the  Comprehensive  National  Security  Concept,

* These six principles are commitment to: (1) the vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative,
and  sustainable  security;  (2)  respecting  the  sovereignty  and  territorial  integrity  of  all  countries;
(3)  abiding  by  the  purposes  and  principles  of  the  UN  Charter;  (4)  taking  the  legitimate  securi-
ty  concerns  of  all  countries  seriously;  (5)  peacefully  resolving  differences  and  disputes  between
countries through dialogue and consultation; and (6) maintaining security in both traditional and
non-traditional domains. China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, The Global Security Initiative  Con-

see  Chapter  7,  “China’s  New  Measures  for  Control,  Mobilization,
and Resilience.”)

The  Global  Security  Initiative  lists  the  establishment  of  a  “new
security  framework”  in  the  Middle  East  among  its  priorities  for  in-
ternational cooperation.* 67 Minister Wang reportedly introduced the
concept during the second China-led Middle East Security Forum in
September 2022.68 Minister Wang describes the new security archi-
tecture as emphasizing the leading role of Middle Eastern countries
in regional security affairs, abiding by the UN Charter, and focusing
on Israel-Palestine peace talks.69 According to Dr. Fravel, the frame-
work could be interpreted as an effort to undermine U.S. leadership
in  the  region,  given  its  emphasis  on  resisting  outside  interference
and  sanctions.70  Beijing  presented  the  March  2023  normalization
of  relations  between  Iran  and  Saudi  Arabia  in  Beijing  as  a  model
for  resolving  “hotspot  issues” †  and  a  major  victory  for  the  Global
Security Initiative, crediting it with a “wave of reconciliation” across
the region.71

Global Development Initiative

The Global Development Initiative is China’s development frame-
work that Beijing claims aims to unite countries under the concepts
of common development and “win-win cooperation.” 72 This initiative
focuses on smaller-scale development projects ‡ implemented by the
Ministry  of  Foreign  Affairs  in  partnership  with  existing  and  new-
ly  established  multinational  institutions,  in  contrast  to  BRI’s  large
state-owned  enterprise-driven  infrastructure  projects,  but  together
they act as drivers of China’s “South-South cooperation” strategy.§ 73
According  to  Chen  Yunnan,  a  research  fellow  at  the  London-based
Overseas  Development  Institute,  a  global  affairs  think  tank,  the
Global  Development  Initiative  is “conveniently  free  of  the  negative
optics  and  baggage  that  the  BRI  has  accumulated  over  the  years
with  its  spotty  environmental  record  and  especially,  the  polemical

* The  Global  Security  Initiative  is  frequently  mentioned  during  China’s  diplomatic  meetings
and  has  been  written  into  numerous  bilateral  and  multilateral  documents.  Xi  also  promoted
the  initiative  during  his  second  major  diplomatic  tour  of  the  Middle  East  in  December  2022,
mentioning  it  in  speeches  given  at  the  first  China-Gulf  Cooperation  Council  and  China-Arab
States  Summits.  China  Institute  of  International  Studies, “Report  on  the  Implementation  of  the

accusations  of  predatory  lending  and  debt  traps  that  it  has  been
unable to shake.” 74

Since  the  Global  Development  Initiative  was  announced  in  2021,
17 Arab  countries  have  endorsed  it  and  12 Arab  states  have  joined
the  initiative’s  “Group  of  Friends.” 75  A  June  2023  progress  report
on  the  initiative,  published  by  the  State  Council-affiliated  Center
for  International  Knowledge  on  Development,  said  that  the  Chi-
na-led  Global  Clean  Energy  Cooperation  Partnership—which  has
encouraged participation by members of the Arab League, the SCO,
BRICS, and others to make a joint effort in the development of green
and  low-carbon  energy—will  be  developed  under  the  Global  Devel-
opment  Initiative  framework,  without  providing  further  details  on
how the initiative will enhance or change the partnership.76 During
a  May  2024  speech,  Minister Wang  said  China  has  initiated  30  de-
velopment  cooperation  projects  involving  Arab  countries  under  the
Global Development Initiative.* 77

Global Civilization Initiative

The Global Civilization Initiative is a Chinese framework intend-
ed  to  combat  Western  countries’  promotion  of  “universal  values”
by  advocating  for  the  respect  of  a “diversity  of  civilizations.” 78 The
Global  Civilization  Initiative,  launched  in  March  2023,  is  intended
to  create  an  alternative  framework  to  liberal  values  and  norms.† 79
During Xi’s March 2023 speech announcing the initiative to the Chi-
nese  Communist  Party  High-Level  Dialogue  with  Political  Parties,
he stated that countries must “refrain from imposing their own val-
ues  or  models  on  others.” 80  According  to  R.  Evan  Ellis,  a  research
professor  at  the  U.S. Army War  College  Strategic  Studies  Institute,
“By  promoting  the  relativism  of  values  and  arguing  against  calling
out  bad  behavior  and  seeking  to  stop  it,  the  concept  appeals  to  re-
gimes that desire to do what they wish.” 81

While the initiative remains somewhat nebulous, an official read-
out from the July 2023 China-Arab States Political Parties Dialogue
suggests it will take the form of exchanges and cooperation between
local  governments,  think  tanks,  universities,  nongovernmental  or-
ganizations,  and  media  entities.82 The  readout  also  stated  that  the
CCP is “willing to invite” 200 leaders of Arab political parties, politi-
cal organizations, and think tank and media representatives to visit
China for exchanges every year, but it did not outline specific details
regarding  which  countries  will  be  invited,  what  kinds  of  activities
they will participate in, or how long the CCP will carry out the ex-
changes.83  In  May  2024,  Xi  announced  that  China  would  establish

† According  to  R.  Evan  Ellis,  a  research  professor  of  Latin American  studies  at  the  U.S. Army

na,  as  well  as  other  states  with  linkages  to  ancient  empires,  including  Beijing’s  current  illiberal
partners  Russia  and  Iran  (Persia),  and  Global  South  countries  China  is  courting  (Egypt  and

with Arab countries to “achieve the goal of 10 million two-way visits
of tourists in the next five years.” 84 If these exchanges come to fru-
ition,  this  may  indicate  that  Beijing  sees  the  Middle  East  as  a  key
region for expanding the use of the Global Civilization Initiative as
a new brand and tool for greater soft power influence.

China Garners Support from Middle East on Repressive
Uyghur Policies

Although systematic elimination of Muslim religious expression
is  a  central  part  of  the  human  rights  crisis  taking  place  in  the
Xinjiang  Uyghur  Autonomous  Region  (XUAR),  the  governments
of Muslim majority countries have remained largely silent on the
matter.85  China’s  efforts  have  been  successful  in  garnering  the
support of Arab countries in the Middle East, some of which have
even issued statements of support of China’s policies in the region
and  have  cooperated  in  returning  Uyghurs  to  China,  where  they
face  prohibitions  on  Muslim  religious  practices,  arbitrary  deten-
tion, and torture in contravention of international law.86

Prior  to  the  beginning  of  the  crackdown  in  2016,  Uyghurs  fre-
quently  traveled  to  the  Middle  East  for  business,  for  education,
or to undertake the Hajj. Many Uyghurs were subsequently sent
for “reeducation” *  in  the  camps  simply  for  traveling  to  one  of  26
“sensitive countries,” which included Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Saudi Ara-
bia,  Syria,  Turkey,  and  the  UAE.87  Yet,  many  of  these  countries
have  made  statements  of  support  for  China’s  policies  through
UN  letters  or  during  state  visits.88  Middle  Eastern  diplomats
and  journalists  are  given  tours  of  the  region  and  encouraged  to
repeat  Chinese  narratives.89  Furthermore,  some  Middle  Eastern
countries—including  Egypt,  Qatar,  Saudi  Arabia,  Syria,  and  the
UAE—have  been  cooperating  with  the  Chinese  security  services
in  locating,  detaining,  or  providing  for  the  refoulement  of  Uy-
ghurs.90

As a country with cultural affinity for Uyghurs and other Tur-
kic  peoples,  Turkey’s  policies  are  somewhat  different,  and  it  re-
mains  home  to  a  large  Uyghur  diaspora.  Even  so,  Turkey  has
increased its cooperation with China in recent years, limiting in-
formation  about  the  crisis  in  the  media,  constricting  Uyghur  ac-
tivism,  and  increasing  the  threat  of  deportation.91  In  June  2024,
Turkish  Foreign  Minister  Hakan  Fidan  made  the  first  high-level
visit to XUAR by a Turkish official since 2012, announcing great-
er  counterterrorism  cooperation  and  trade  while  avoiding  overt
criticism of Beijing’s human rights abuses.† 92

* In May 2014, Beijing launched its “Strike Hard Campaign against Violent Terrorism” in Xin-
jiang. According to Human Rights Watch, “Since at least 2014, the Chinese government has sub-

torture  and  deaths  in  detention,  and  enforced  disappearances.”  Human  Rights  Watch,  “ ‘Break

China Garners Support from Middle East on Repressive
Uyghur Policies—Continued
The  leaders  of  Middle  Eastern  countries  have  evidently  deter-
mined  that  it  is  not  in  their  interest  to  condemn  crimes  against
humanity  taking  place  in  XUAR  against  a  Muslim  population.
Obtaining  silence  or  support  from  Middle  Eastern  countries  for
Chinese  policies  in  Xinjiang,  as  well  as  Hong  Kong  and Taiwan,
is  a  high  priority  in  China’s  engagement  with  the  region,  as  Dr.
Murphy  pointed  out  in  her  testimony  before  the  Commission.93
Dr. Fulton observes that Middle Eastern countries have little in-
centive to jeopardize their economic interests and trade relations
and that China appears to have successfully framed the issue as
one similar to Middle Eastern governments’ concerns about polit-
ical Islam and terrorism.94

Beijing  Engages  China-Arab  States  Cooperation  Forum  to  Bolster

Regional Legitimacy

Although China conducts diplomatic activities in a range of differ-
ent multilateral institutions and platforms, the CASCF, established
in  2004,  serves  as  China’s  primary  multilateral  coordination  mech-
anism with the League of Arab States,* including the Gulf Coopera-
tion Council (GCC) countries.95 The CASCF holds ministerial meet-
ings  every  two  years,  and  other  senior  officials  meet  on  an  annual
basis  to  implement  any  action  plans  that  have  been  developed.96
The CASCF is used by China for several key purposes:

 • The forum emphasizes political cooperation with China, partic-
ularly  China’s  “Five  Principles  of  Peaceful  Coexistence” †  and
the concept of “South-South Cooperation.” 97 The Five Principles
of Peaceful Coexistence “represent a very conservative interpre-
tation of Westphalian norms of sovereignty, territorial integrity,
and  non-interference,”  Dr.  Murphy  said.98  They  stand  in  con-
trast  to  the  liberal,  rules-based  international  order’s  attention
to  human  rights  and  democratic  values,  and  in  doing  so  they
appeal to the region’s autocratic governments.

 • According  to  Dr.  Murphy,  the  CASCF  “explicitly  includes  coop-
eration  on  key  Arab  political  issues,”  such  as  the  Middle  East
peace  process  and  more  recently  discussion  of  the  ongoing  con-
flict in Gaza.99

 • China  uses  the  forum  to  solicit  support  for  various  issues  im-
portant to China internationally. Dr. Murphy notes that one ex-
ample  of  this  type  of  behavior  was  the  inclusion  of  wording  in
the CASCF documents supporting China’s position on territorial
and maritime disputes in the South China Sea in 2016.100 Chi-

* The League of Arab States includes Algeria, Bahrain, Comoros, Djibouti, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan,
Kuwait,  Lebanon,  Libya,  Mauritania,  Morocco,  Oman,  Palestine,  Qatar,  Saudi  Arabia,  Somalia,
Sudan, Syria, Tunisia, the United Arab Emirates, and Yemen. Diplomatic Service of the European
Union, League of Arab States (LAS) and the EU, August 3, 2021.

† The  Five  Principles  are:  mutual  respect  for  territory  and  sovereignty,  mutual  nonaggression,

na  likewise  has  used  the  forum  to  seek  statements  of  support
from  Middle  Eastern  states  for  its  policies  in  Xinjiang,  provid-
ing  diplomatic  cover  for  China’s  human  rights  abuses  against
Uyghurs  and  other Turkic  peoples.101  (See  the “China  Garners
Support from Middle East on Repressive Uyghur Policies” text-
box above for more on these efforts.)

 • China has also used the forum as a primary multilateral mech-
anism to coordinate economic activities with the Middle East.102
The  most  recent  ministerial-level  meeting  of  CASCF  was  held  in
late  May  through  early  June  2024  and  focused  on  issues  such  as
further  economic  and  technological  cooperation  as  well  as  a  poten-
tial  ceasefire  in  Gaza.103  China  and  the  Arab  states  also  issued  a
21-point joint statement at the forum criticizing Israel and the Unit-
ed  States,  further  demonstrating  Beijing’s  one-sided  actions  as  it
has attempted to portray itself as a neutral mediator of the war.104

China  Expands  Engagement  with  Key  U.S.  Partners  in  the

Middle East

China  is  seeking  to  bolster  its  relations  and  influence  with Arab
states  in  order  to  expand  economic  ties  and  promote  its  vision  of
an  alternative  world  order,  and  in  the  course  of  doing  so  it  seeks
to exploit tensions in these countries’ relationships with the United
States. China places a particularly high priority on its relationships
with  Saudi  Arabia,  the  UAE,  and  Egypt,  all  of  which  have  signed
comprehensive  strategic  partnership  agreements  with  China  and
hosted  visits  by  Xi  at  least  once—Egypt  in  2016,  the  UAE  in  2018,
and  Saudi Arabia  in  2016  and  2022.* 105  Minister Wang  also  made
stops  during  a  six-country  Middle  East  tour  in  2021  and  traveled
to Egypt during a four-country tour of African countries in 2024.106

China  Seeks  to  Become  Alternative  Strategic  Partner  for  Saudi

Arabia

China and Saudi Arabia have shown mutual interest in deepening
their relationship, as Riyadh has sought to court Beijing, and China
has  attempted  to  portray  itself  as  an  essential  strategic  partner  to
Saudi Arabia.107  Dr. Alterman  asserts  that  China  has  sought  to  do
so “partly in the wake of Saudi concerns that the United States has
been abandoning the Middle East as it pivots toward Asia, and part-
ly  by  marketing  the  idea  that  the  Chinese  experience  in  economic
growth holds lessons for Saudi Arabia’s own ambitious economic di-
versification efforts.” 108 Saudi Arabia’s desire to draw closer to Chi-
na  grew  following  the  diplomatic  fallout  caused  by  the  murder  of
Jamal Khashoggi in 2018.109 Dr. Alterman notes, however, that this
motivation  has  dampened  in  recent  years  partly  due  to  the  Biden
Administration’s  reassurance  that  the  United  States  is  not  hostile
toward Saudi Arabia and because China’s regional diplomacy “is no
substitute  for  the  United  States.” 110  Despite  this  more  recent  U.S.
effort,  Saudi Arabia  has  still  pursued  engagement  with  China,  see-
ing  BRI  as  a  way  to  advance  its  Vision  2030  agenda.111  Prior  to

* Before  Xi’s  2016  visit  to  Saudi Arabia,  Egypt,  and  Iran,  the  Ministry  of  Foreign Affairs  pub-
lished  the  Arab  Policy  Paper,  which  laid  out  the  blueprint  for  cooperation  in  a  variety  of  areas,
emphasizing cooperation on energy, investment, and high technology. China’s Ministry of Foreign
Affairs, China’s Arab Policy Paper, January 13, 2016.

348

Xi’s  2022  visit  to  the  country,  Saudi  Arabian  state  media  said  the
Kingdom was keen to develop bilateral relations with China as part
of its strategic plan to boost partnerships with “all influential coun-
tries  and  international  powers.” 112  The  two  sides  enhanced  their
Comprehensive Strategic Partnership, issuing a joint declaration on
economic and defense cooperation in December 2022.113 During the
2022  trip,  Xi  also  attended  the  first  Arab-China  Summit  for  Coop-
eration  and  Development  held  in  Riyadh  in  what  the  Ministry  of
Foreign  Affairs  called  the  “highest-level  diplomatic  event  between
China and the Arab world since the founding of the People’s Repub-
lic of China.” 114

China’s relations with Saudi Arabia have been rooted in econom-
ic  interests,  although  there  is  also  a  small,  somewhat  limited  mili-
tary  strand  that  runs  through  bilateral  ties.115  Dr. Alterman  notes
that  since  the  1990s,  Saudi  Arabia  has  engaged  more  deeply  with
Chinese  firms  when  it  sought  low-cost  construction  options  amid
a  slumping  economy,  with  Chinese  firms  building  some  of  Saudi
Arabia’s most important infrastructure projects, including light rail,
desalination  plants,  and  industrial  projects,  as  well  as  contributing
to  the  country’s  information  technology  (IT)  systems.116  Saudi Ara-
bia occasionally sought to procure Chinese weapons and technology
as  alternatives  to  those  the  United  States  would  not  provide,  like
CSS-2  missiles  in  the  1980s,  with  China  now  selling  Saudi  Arabia
drones,  helping  Riyadh  build  ballistic  missiles,  and  being  involved
in domestic surveillance efforts.117

China-Saudi Cooperation on Ballistic Missiles
Saudi  Arabia  is  diversifying  its  own  arms  procurement  in  re-
sponse to Iran’s growing military capabilities, including by acquiring
Chinese  ballistic  missile  technology  and  expertise.  Although  China
is not a member of the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR),
China’s government nevertheless made a formal voluntary commit-
ment  in  2000  to  abide  by  its  export  restrictions  on  ballistic  missile
components and technology.118 Despite this, China has played a key
role  in  Saudi  Arabia’s  missile  procurement  efforts.119  In  the  late
1980s, China first delivered liquid-propelled Dong Feng-3A (DF-3A)
missiles to Saudi Arabia, yet the transfer was not publicly acknowl-
edged  until  2014.120  China  has  reportedly  also  transferred  addi-
tional Dong Feng-class missiles to Riyadh since 2018.* 121 Although
U.S.  intelligence  agencies  have  raised  concerns  about  the  transfers,
the  United  States  was  reluctant  to  impose  consequences  on  Saudi
Arabia  in  2021,  a  strategic  partner  in  the  region,  according  to  the
Wall  Street  Journal.122  The  Arms  Control  Association  asserts  that
although not illegal, China’s assistance to Saudi Arabia “contradicts
its vow to abide by the MTCR,” as China is not a member of the ex-
port control regime but has pledged to adhere to its guidelines pro-
hibiting  the  export  of  missiles  capable  of  delivering  a  500-kilogram
payload more than 186 miles (300 kilometers).123 In December 2021,

* Dong  Feng  ballistic  missiles,  produced  by  the  China Aerospace  Science  and  Industry  Corpo-
ration, have a range of approximately 170 miles to 9,320 miles. The missiles have the capability
to engage targets at short, medium, intermediate, and intercontinental ranges and are equipped
with diverse warhead-carrying capabilities, enabling strong deterrence abilities. Army Technology,

China-Saudi Cooperation on Ballistic Missiles—Continued

analysts  from  the  James  Martin  Center  for  Nonproliferation  Stud-
ies, affiliated with the Middlebury Institute of International Studies
at Monterey, assessed that satellite images of a missile facility near
Al-Dawadmi, Saudi Arabia, indicate the facility was likely built with
Chinese  assistance.124  During  the  same  month,  reports  emerged
that  U.S.  intelligence  agencies  had  assessed  that  Saudi Arabia  was
producing ballistic missiles domestically with Chinese assistance.125
It remains unclear whether the missile being produced at the iden-
tified  site  is  a  Chinese  design,  but  given  China’s  large  transfers  of
ballistic missile technology to Riyadh, it is certainly possible.126

UAE  Carrying  Out  Balancing  Act  between  the  United  States  and

China

China  views  the  UAE  as  a  country  where  the  United  States  is
gradually  losing  its  influence,  and  one  with  whom  Beijing  has  an
opportunity  to  deepen  its  cooperation.  According  to  a  2020  article
by  Chinese  scholar  Tong  Fei,  an  associate  researcher  at  the  Chi-
nese  Academy  of  Social  Sciences’  Institute  of  West-Asian  and  Afri-
can Studies, as the United States has shifted its focus to Asia, Arab
countries—including  the  UAE—have  pursued  alternative  partners,
particularly  in  the  economic  realm.127  The  UAE  is  home  to  an  es-
timated  quarter  million  Chinese  nationals,  and  Chinese  firms  are
active there in construction and other fields.128 Dr. Tong asserts that
“since adopting an eastward foreign policy, the UAE has made deep-
ening its comprehensive strategic partnership with China a top pri-
ority in its diplomatic goals.” 129 In his testimony to the Commission,
Dr.  Alterman  noted  that  “the  Abu  Dhabi  government  increasingly
has  sought  to  strike  an  ‘active  neutrality’  posture  in  the  world,”
growing its ties with both China and Russia and confident that it is
powerful enough to advance its own interests.130

Despite  the  UAE’s  willingness  to  work  with  Beijing,  Chinese  ex-
perts  still  assess  that  there  are  challenges  in  their  diplomatic  re-
lations  that  need  to  be  overcome.  Dr.  Tong  assesses  that  although
the  UAE  hopes  to  take  advantage  of  BRI,  strengthen  investment
cooperation  with  China,  get  rid  of  excessive  dependence  on  oil,  and
accelerate  its  economic  diversification  process,  the  two  countries
have  little  understanding  of  each  other  due  to  regional  differences
and  separate  ideologies.131  Dr.  Tong  argues  that  government  offi-
cials  and  ordinary  people  in  the  UAE  not  only  lack  a  deep  under-
standing of China but also have doubts about Beijing’s Middle East
policy.132  Furthermore,  Dr. Tong  states  that “some  UAE  elites  hope
that  China  can  assume  more  peace  and  security  responsibilities  in
the Middle East and become a force that can compete with the Unit-
ed States in the Middle East” but that the UAE has concerns about
China’s  cooperation  with  Iran,  which  it  views  as  a  threat.133  Dr.
Tong  also  asserts  that  some  within  the  UAE  are  dissatisfied  with
the  trade  deficit  with  China,  as  China  has  used  BRI  to  obtain  en-
ergy  from  the  UAE  but  is  unwilling  to  buy  petrochemical  products
the  UAE  wants  to  sell  to  China.134  Dr. Tong  assesses  that  because
of this, “it can be said that the mutual political trust in the coopera-

350

tion between the two sides is still relatively fragile.” 135 (For more on
the  challenges  that  China  and  the  UAE’s  technological  cooperation
face under increasing U.S. scrutiny, see the section on “China-Middle
East Technology Relations” within this chapter.)

The Reach of Chinese Media in the Middle East
Over  the  past  decade,  China  has  dramatically  increased  its  ef-
forts to build what it calls “discourse power”—the ability to shape
global public opinion in the way it does domestically—through its
media presence in Middle Eastern countries.136 It has been pour-
ing  resources  into  expanding  the  reach  of  foreign-facing  media
outlets  in  the  region.137  Chinese  government-connected  entities
and  their  proxies  have  been  holding  summits,  tours,  and  train-
ings  with  foreign  journalists,  encouraging  them  to  echo  Chinese
narratives while also controlling local traditional and new media
outlets.138 China has become increasingly adept at utilizing local
languages  to  communicate  its  preferred  narratives,  focusing  on
economic  cooperation  and  providing  positive  stories  on  China.139
In  addition  to  Arabic-language  versions  of  official  media  such
as  CGTN,  overseas  Chinese  networks  like  China-Arab  TV  serve
official  narratives  as  well,  partnering  with  China’s  Central  Pro-
paganda  Department  to  strengthen  cooperation  in  film  and  TV
production in order to “transmit China’s voice” and “promote Chi-
na’s  image  among  Arab  countries.” 140  In  2022,  the  China  Media
Group,  a  Chinese  state  media  organization,  and  the  Saudi  Min-
istry  of  Media  launched  a  joint  partnership  initiative  to  promote
relations between Arab countries and China at the Arab-Chinese
Media Cooperation Forum.141 The initiative focuses on promoting
the  presence  of  Chinese  media  in  Arab  channels  and  translating
Chinese television shows into Arabic for broadcast in the Palestin-
ian Territories, Algeria, Jordan, Sudan, Iraq, and Saudi Arabia.142
Chinese  experts  and  state  media  have  pushed  a  narrative  that
frames  the  United  States’  supposedly  declining  influence  in  the  re-
gion  as  an  opportunity  for  Beijing  to  increase  its  engagement.  For
example,  a  July  2022  article  by  Tang  Zhichao,  a  professor  at  the
University  of  the  Chinese Academy  of  Social  Sciences,  argued  that
the Obama, Trump, and Biden Administrations were “obsessed with
strategic  competition  among  major  powers  and  implemented  a  pol-
icy  of  strategic  contraction  from  the  Middle  East  to  achieve  a  shift
to the Asia-Pacific region,” which he claims created a vacuum in re-
gional power and security.143 Dr. Tang argues in a February 2024 ar-
ticle that during the 30 years of the post-Cold War era, “the United
States’  hegemonic  position  in  the  Middle  East  has  gradually  fallen
from high to low,” which has prompted regional countries to “increas-
ingly  strengthen  their  strategic  autonomy,  providing  an  important
opportunity for the strategic cooperation between China, Russia and
Middle Eastern countries to be enhanced.” 144 Gao Wencheng, a Xin-
hua news reporter, also said in June 2023 that recently, “failure” has
become a common keyword when the international media discusses
the  United  States’  Middle  East  policy,  claiming  the  United  States
has lost the “hearts of the people” in the region due to “wanton bul-
lying.” 145

351

Supporting  Iran  and  Terrorist  Groups  to  Undermine  the

United States

China and Iran share strong opposition to the U.S.-led liberal in-
ternational  order.146  As  it  does  with  other  countries  in  the  region,
China  takes  an  opportunistic  approach  to  its  relationship  with
Iran.147  China  will  show  solidarity  with  Iran  to  the  degree  that  it
comes at little cost to Beijing; at the same time, it takes advantage
of  Iran’s  isolated  position,  buying  discounted  oil  and  failing  to  fully
deliver on promised investments.148 Dr. Alterman argues that China
leverages  tensions  between  the  United  States  and  Iran,  preferring
“a  world  in  which  the  United  States  is  bogged  down  in  the  Middle
East  and  alienates  much  of  the  Global  South  through  its  actions
there.” 149  China  has  shown  support  to  Iran  through  its  rhetorical,
military, and economic actions, all of which serve to undermine U.S.
interests in the region.

Beijing  Props  Up  Tehran  with  Rhetorical  and  Diplomatic

Support

China has played a significant role in easing Iran’s diplomatic iso-
lation in recent years, particularly through its efforts to shield Iran
from further sanctions over its nuclear program. China vocally crit-
icized  the  re-imposition  of  sanctions  by  the  United  States  in  2018
after  the  United  States  withdrew  from  the  Joint  Comprehensive
Plan of Action.150 It has  stated opposition to  sanctions on Iran and
condemned  the  United  States’  Iran  policy,  with  Xi  stating  during  a
February 2023 meeting with then Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi
that  China  “opposes  external  forces  interfering  in  Iran’s  internal
affairs  and  undermining  Iran’s  security  and  stability.” 151  A  likely
motivation was that the 2018 sanctions dampened the potential for
Chinese  trade  and  investment  with  Iran  despite  continued  engage-
ment by China’s more risk-tolerant companies.152

China has also eased Iran’s isolation by drawing it into China-led
multilateral  institutions,  with  Iran  finally  achieving  its  longstand-
ing  goal  of  joining  the  SCO  in  2023.* 153  In  2010,  the  SCO  intro-
duced  a  membership  criteria  preventing  states  with  UN  sanctions
from  joining—a  move  some  assess  was  aimed  at  preventing  Iran’s
accession.154 Despite these initial impediments, Iran’s Supreme Na-
tional Security Council announced in August 2021 that the “political
obstacles” to accession were resolved through dialogue with Russia,
according to Nicole Grajewski, a fellow at the Carnegie Endowment
for  International  Peace.155  In  addition  to  smoothing  out  its  differ-
ences  with  Tajikistan,  Dr.  Grajewski  said,  Iran  mustered  enough
support from China to back its accession.† 156 Presently, Iran is the

* Iran  first  applied  for  full  membership  in  the  SCO  in  2008  and  became  an  observer  state  in
2005. The  SCO  is  mainly  a  platform  for  security  cooperation,  conducting  military  exercises,  and
fighting  what  China  calls  the  “three  evils  of  terrorism,  separatism  and  extremism,”  serving  as
what scholar Nicole Bayat Grajewski calls a “regime-preservation network” to help coordinate in-
ternal repression. While the organization is presently little more than a “talking shop,” according
to  Dr.  Fulton,  it  could  become  a “a  key  platform  for  institutionalizing  authoritarian  cooperation
and resilience.” Jonathan Fulton, “Iran Joining the SCO Isn’t Surprising. But Beijing’s Promotion
of Illiberal Norms in Eurasia Should Get More Attention,” Atlantic Council, July 13, 2023; Nicole
Bayat Grajewski, “Iran and the SCO: The Quest for Legitimacy and Regime Preservation,” Middle
East Policy 30:2 (Summer 2023).

only  Middle  Eastern  country  to  have  full  membership  in  the  SCO,
opening up potential closer coordination with China and Russia.* 157
Iran’s accession into the BRICS organization † on January 1, 2024,
represents another instance of entrance into alternative multina-
tional  institutions,  having  received  some  rhetorical  support  from
Beijing.  While  Russia  was  the  original  organizer,  BRICS  has  be-
come  a  high-profile  vehicle  of  China’s “South-South”  Cooperation
strategy,  with  Minister Wang  calling  on  it  to “oppose  attempts  to
instigate  a  new  Cold  War”  at  the  June  2024  ministerial  meeting
in  Russia.158  In  July  2023,  Chang  Hua,  China’s  then  ambassa-
dor  to  Iran,  said  in  an  interview  with  Iranian  media  that  “Chi-
na  supports  Iran’s  membership  in  the  BRICS  organization . . . .
Although  the  agreement  of  other  BRICS  members  is  necessary,
we support Iran’s aspiration to join the organization.” 159 General
Secretary  Xi  met  with  then  President  Raisi  on  the  sidelines  of
the  BRICS  Summit  in  August  2023,  saying  China  “stood  ready
to  strengthen  cooperation  with  Iran  on  BRICS  and  other  multi-
lateral  platforms.” 160 Although  BRICS  membership  may  serve  to
further  align  Iran  with  China  and  Russia,  other  members  of  the
organization  might  have  concerns  about  the  possibility  of  being
drawn  into  an  anti-U.S.  bloc.

China’s  Transfer  of  Dual-Use  Technology  to  Iran  and  Its
Terrorist  Groups  Threatens  U.S.  National  Security
Interests

China’s transfer of dual-use technologies and components to Iran
and its terrorist proxies—including parts used in armed drones and
ballistic  missiles—undermines  U.S.  national  security  interests  and
stability in the region.‡ In 2023 and 2024, the Treasury Department
placed  sanctions  on  networks  of  Chinese  suppliers  and  Hong  Kong
front  companies  selling  components  to  the  Iranian  ballistic  missile
and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) programs, including the produc-
ers  of  the  Shahed  drone  used  by  Russia  in  Ukraine  and  in  attacks
on  shipping  in  the  Red  Sea.161 The  Department  of  Commerce’s  Bu-
reau  of  Industry  and  Security  has  also  placed  Chinese  and  Hong
Kong  companies  on  the  Entity  List  in  2023  and  2024  for  supplying
dual-use components for Iran’s UAV industry.162 U.S. Assistant Sec-
retary  of  State  for  Near  Eastern  Affairs  Barbara  Leaf  testified  in
2022 that Iranian proxies are using Chinese UAVs, and the Chinese
government  is  not  attempting  to  curtail  the  sales.163  According  to

BeiDou satellite navigation system, a rival to the U.S. GPS system,
which  could  bolster  drone  and  missile  performance  and  targeting
through its advanced navigation and communication system.* 164

Chinese  military  equipment  and  components  have  allegedly
been  obtained  by  Hamas  and  the  Houthis,  highlighting  the  po-
tential  danger  of  Chinese  products  supporting  the  operations  of
non-state actors in the region. After October 2023, the Associated
Press  and  the  Israel  Defense  Forces  reported  that  Hamas  was
using  China-origin  weapons  in  Gaza.165  Although  China  claims
it  does  not  sell  weapons  to  non-state  actors,  reports  indicate  the
Chinese-made weapons may have been sold elsewhere in the Mid-
dle  East  and  then  smuggled  to  Hamas  terrorists.166  An  investi-
gation  by  Israeli  Defense  Forces  found  that  Hamas  has  obtained
advanced  weapons  and  technology  made  in  China,  including  car-
tridges  and  rifle  sights  for  M16  assault  rifles,  automatic  grenade
launchers,  and  communication  devices.167

Chinese  components  have  also  appeared  in  weapons  used  by
Iran  and  its  Houthi  proxies  in  attacks  on  Saudi  Arabia.  Drones
used  in  a  September  2019  attack  on  two  Saudi  Aramco  facili-
ties  claimed  by  the  Houthis  but  attributed  to  Iran  by  the  United
States  and  a  UN  investigation  were  later  revealed  to  be  Shahed
131  drones,  which  utilize  motors  resembling  the  MDR-208  sin-
gle  rotor  UAV  engine,  made  by  Beijing  MicroPilot  UAV  Flight
Control Systems, a Chinese company.† 168 Iran has supplied these
and  other  UAVs  and  missiles  to  the  Houthis  for  their  attacks  on
targets  across  the  Middle  East.169  While  one  Chinese  military
blogger  has  speculated  that  the  Houthi  rebels  were  potentially
using  Chinese  missile  technology  previously  shared  with  Iran,  to
date  there  has  been  no  public  evidence  that  the  Chinese  govern-
ment is directly transferring weapons to the Houthis.170 However
there  is  evidence  that  weapons  used  by  Houthi  rebels  contain
Chinese-made  parts.‡ 171  Furthermore,  in  June  2024,  the  Trea-
sury  Department  announced  that  Ali  Abd-al-Wahhab  Muham-
mad  al-Wazir,  a  China-based  Houthi-affiliated  individual,  played
a  “key  role  in  procuring  materials  that  enable  Houthi  forces  to
manufacture  advanced  conventional  weapons  inside  Yemen.” 172
He utilized his China-based company, Guangzhou Tasneem Trad-
ing  Company  Limited  (Guangzhou  Tasneem),  a  subsidiary  of
Hong  Kong-based  Tasneem  Trading  Company  Limited,  to  obtain
these  items  and  ship  them  to Yemen.173

China Increases Purchases of Sanctioned Oil from Iran
China  has  increased  imports  of  Iranian  oil  in  recent  years  by
constructing a parallel network of shippers, refineries, and finan-
cial institutions to obscure imports and bypass U.S. sanctions.174
Taken  in  conjunction  with  its  increased  purchases  of  sanctioned
Russian  oil,  China  is  constructing  what  researchers  at  the  At-
lantic Council have dubbed an “axis of evasion” that undermines
U.S.  sanctions,  profiting  in  the  near  term  from  discounted  ener-
gy  imports  while  establishing  an  alternative  trade  and  payment
system  that  may  buffer  it  from  future  economic  sanctions.175
According  to  estimates  by  the  nonprofit  United  Against  Nuclear
Iran and others who track data on Iranian oil exports, China im-
ported  1.1  million  barrels  per  day  (bpd)  from  Iran  in  2023,  up  9
percent from the year prior.176 If correct, this would mean China
is  now  responsible  for  purchasing  nearly  90  percent  of  Iranian
crude  exports,*  which  would  account  for  nearly  10  percent  of  to-
tal  Chinese  crude  imports,  making  Iran  the  fourth-largest  sup-
plier  to  China  in  2023,  just  behind  Iraq.177  Chinese  customs  did
not  report  any  oil  imports  from  Iran  in  2023,  so  it  appears  oil  is
imported through transshipment facilities in Malaysia, the UAE,
and  Oman  and  relabeled  as “Middle  Eastern”  oil.178  China  is  es-
timated to have imported 1.4 million bpd on average through the
first five months of this year.179

The  sanctioned  oil  is  transported  by  a  so-called  “dark  fleet”
of  older  tankers  that  use  a  variety  of  tactics  to  avoid  detection,
such as turning off signaling systems when  making Iranian port
calls,  sending  fake  location  information  (known  as  “spoofing”),
and  conducting  ship-to-ship  transfers  outside  authorized  trans-
fer  zones  using  the  cover  of  bad  weather  to  hide  operations,  a
practice  that  heightens  the  risk  of  an  environmentally  costly  ac-
cident.180 According to testimony before the Commission by Erica
Downs,  senior  research  scholar  at  Columbia  University’s  Center
on  Global  Energy  Policy,  independent  refineries  known  as  “tea-
pots”  purchased  all  the  Iranian  crude  oil  imported  into  China  in
2023.181  China’s  large  state-owned  oil  companies  have  curtailed
their involvement in purchasing and processing Iranian oil since
late  2019  after  the  re-imposition  of  sanctions  following  the  U.S.
withdrawal from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.182

Congress  and  the  Administration  have  taken  a  number  of  re-
cent  actions  intended  to  address  the  issue.  Since  2021,  over  180
entities  and  individuals  have  been  sanctioned  for  their  involve-

* Iran’s estimated revenue from oil exports was $12 billion over the first three months of the gov-
ernment’s fiscal year starting in March 2024. For comparison, the country’s gross domestic product in
2023 was $401.5 billion and the government’s budget for 2024 is estimated to be $49.2 billion, about
equivalent to expected total revenue from oil exports. In other words, China’s oil purchases from Iran
appear  to  equate to nearly 90  percent  of  Iran’s  entire  government budget, though due to associated
costs oil export revenue is believed to directly fund 45.4 percent of the government’s operating budget.
Given  the  scale  of  China’s  oil  purchases  from  Iran,  and  lack  of  alternative  buyers  due  to  sanctions,
Beijing  appears  to  have  immense  capacity  to  influence  Tehran.  There  is  little  evidence  that  China
has used this leverage with respect to Iran’s support for proxies in the Middle East—such as Houthi
attacks on shipping (other than perhaps protecting Chinese flagged ships) and Hezbollah—or Iran’s
direct  attacks  on  Israel.  Iran  International,  “Iran  Faces  26%  Oil  Revenue  Deficit  Despite  Surging

China Increases Purchases of Sanctioned Oil from Iran—
Continued
ment in the trade of sanctioned Iranian oil.183 Congress included
two  sanctions  measures  as  part  of  the  supplemental  appropria-
tions  package  enacted  in April  2024:  (1)  the  Stop  Harboring  Ira-
nian  Petroleum  (SHIP) Act  directs  the  president  to  sanction  for-
eign persons involved in activity related to Iranian oil, to include
refineries and port owners and operators; and (2) the Iran-China
Energy  Sanctions  Act  of  2023  expands  the  definition  of  “signifi-
cant financial transactions” in the fiscal year (FY) 2012 National
Defense  Authorization  Act  to  include  those  by  Chinese  financial
institutions  that  involve  Iranian  oil  exports,  and  it  also  directs
the  president  to  make  an  annual  determination  on  whether  fi-
nancial institutions have engaged in such activity.184

China’s Economic, Trade, and Investment Interests

in the Middle East

China  replaced  the  United  States  as  the  Middle  East’s  largest
trade  partner  in  2010,  and  China-Middle  East  economic  ties  have
deepened  in  the  years  since.185  Economic  relations  feature  prom-
inently  in  China’s  engagement  with  countries  in  the  region,  with
Chinese  companies  increasing  their  physical  presence  in  key  logis-
tical  nodes  of  the  global  supply  chain  and  seeking  to  shore  up  ac-
cess  to  critical  resources.186  In  January  2016,  the  State  Council  of
the People’s Republic of China presented an Arab Policy Paper that
outlined  its  priorities  and  approach  to  economic  cooperation  with
key  Middle  Eastern  countries  and  served  as  a  template  for  policy
toward most of the region.187 The paper called for establishment of
a  “1+2+3  cooperation  pattern”  with  energy  cooperation  at  the  core;
infrastructure construction and expanding trade and investment as
the  “two  wings”;  and  nuclear  energy,  space  satellites,  and  new  en-
ergy  as  “three  breakthroughs”  that  together  would  be  the  defining
elements  of  relationships  with Arab  countries.188  Based  on  China’s
behavior  in  the  region  and  these  expressions  of  its  plans,  it  seems
likely  that  in  the  short  to  medium  term  China  will  continue  to  as-
sign  top  priority  to  ensuring  steady  access  to  the  region’s  energy
resources and will seek to benefit from increased market access and
infrastructure  contracts.189  In  the  long  term,  as  a  transition  away
from  fossil  fuels  alters  the  region’s  position  in  global  trade,  China
will  seek  to  evolve  cooperation  with  key  countries  in  the  region  to
advance  toward  its  goals  of  establishing  emerging  technologies  like
artificial intelligence (AI), advanced computing, and clean energy as
central economic growth drivers.190

Trends in Trade and Investment

China has become the largest trading partner for many countries
in  the  region,  with  growth  in  total  trade  and  direct  investment  be-
tween China and the Middle East outpacing that of China with the
rest of the world over the past five years.191 In 2022, China was the
top origin country for goods imports for ten out of 15 Middle Eastern
countries, an increase from five a decade earlier and zero in 2002.192

356

As an export destination for goods, China ranked first for six coun-
tries in 2022, up from three in 2012 and zero in 2002.193

Energy Relations

Energy trade remains a mainstay of China-Middle East economic
engagement,  comprising  roughly  85  percent  of  total  exports  from
the  region  to  China  by  value  in  recent  years.194  China  became  a
net  importer  of  crude  oil  in  1993;  since  that  time,  imported  energy
from  the  Middle  East  has  provided  a  sizable  share  of  the  fuel  Chi-
na  consumes.195 While  exports  from  Persian  Gulf  countries *  to  the
United  States  and  the  EU  have  trended  downward  since  the  ear-
ly  2000s,  China’s  crude  oil  imports  from  the  region  have  increased
from about 34 million metric tons at the turn of the century to about
257  million  metric  tons  in  2021  (see  Figure  1).196 The  Middle  East
has consistently accounted for 40–50 percent of China’s total oil and
gas imports dating back to the mid-1990s.197 China’s imports of hy-
drocarbons from the region have continued to grow in recent years,
as  have  two-way  investments  and  long-term  agreements  to  lock  in
consistent  supply  over  the  coming  decades.198  However,  as  China
and  key  suppliers  in  the  Gulf  move  to  transition  segments  of  their
economy  to  clean  and  renewable  energy,  the  dynamic  of  dependen-
cy  is  set  to  shift,  where  China  may  become  a  supplier  of  batteries,
solar,  and  nuclear  energy  systems  to  the  region  and  Gulf  countries
may find themselves in competition with Chinese firms to build out
energy infrastructure in third countries.199

Trade of Hydrocarbons Remains Substantial

China’s  rapid  rise,  vast  population,  and  industrialization  have
made it the world’s largest consumer of energy, largest producer and
consumer  of  coal,  and  largest  emitter  of  carbon  dioxide  from  burn-
ing  hydrocarbons.200  In  2021,  coal  provided  the  majority  of  China’s
energy for consumption (55 percent), followed by petroleum (19 per-
cent), natural gas (9 percent), hydropower (8 percent), non-hydro re-
newables (7 percent), and nuclear energy (2 percent).201 For oil and
natural  gas,  China  remains  heavily  reliant  on  imports,  primarily
from Russia and the Middle East.† 202 Virtually all of China’s energy
imports  from  the  region  are  shipped  through  key  maritime  choke-
points,  including  the  Strait  of  Hormuz  and  the  Strait  of  Malacca,  a
point  of  concern  for  PLA  military  planners.203  (For  further  discus-
sion on China’s oil stockpiling and related measures, see Chapter 7,
“China’s New Measures for Control, Mobilization, and Resilience.”)

Oil Exports to Chinese Market Steadily Rise

With limited domestic production capacity of its own, China relies
on imported oil to power large parts of its transportation and indus-

Qatar, and the UAE—which together sit atop half the world’s known oil reserves. Though all but

Iraq,  referring  solely  to  the  six  Gulf  Cooperation  Council  (GCC)  members.  RAND  Corporation,

69 percent with the UAE on the low end in 2023. Erica Downs, written testimony for U.S.-China

trial sectors.204 China’s imports of crude oil nearly doubled over the
past  decade  from  just  over  six  million  bpd  in  2014  to  11.3  million
bpd  in  2023,  a  record  high.205  According  to  Chinese  customs  data,
flows  from  the  Middle  East  over  this  time  period  increased  from
3.2  million  bpd  in  2014  to  5.2  million  bpd  in  2023,  46  percent  of
China’s total crude imports.206 Saudi Arabia became China’s largest
crude oil supplier in 2018 and remained so until Russia replaced it
in  2023  due  to  China’s  substantial  purchases  of  discounted  oil  sub-
ject  to  sanctions  in  other  markets.207  In  2023,  Russia  supplied  19
percent of China’s imported crude oil, followed by Saudi Arabia (15
percent), Iraq (11 percent), Malaysia (10 percent), and the UAE and
Oman  (both  7  percent).208  However,  it  is  believed  that  a  significant
portion attributed to Malaysia, the UAE, and Oman is relabeled oil
from  Iran.209  For  instance,  Malaysia’s  total  crude  oil  production  in
2023  was  501,000  bpd,  yet  Chinese  customs  reported  importing  1.1
million  bpd,  suggesting  a  sizable  portion  of  the  difference  was  oil
transshipped through the country.210

China Diversifies Energy Imports with Natural Gas Contracts

China has steadily increased the portion of natural gas in its en-
ergy consumption profile, and in recent years it has inked long-term
contracts with top producers such as Qatar to guarantee supply over
the  coming  decades.  In  2022,  Chinese  consumption  of  natural  gas
stood  at  364.6  billion  cubic  meters  (bcm),  the  third  largest  behind
the United States (881 bcm) and Russia (408 bcm).‡ 214 Even though
China’s  imports  provide  only  a  minority  of  the  country’s  gas  con-

* Saudi Aramco is the largest energy company in the world and one of the largest global com-
panies  overall,  with  a  market  capitalization  of  $1.84  trillion.  In  2023,  the  company  reported
revenue of $440 billion and profit of $121 billion, down from a record $161 billion in 2022, which
was the largest ever by a publicly traded company. Julie Pinkerton, “The 10 Most Valuable Com-

sumption,  it  topped  Japan  as  the  number  one  importer  of  liquid
natural gas (LNG) in 2021, importing over 100 bcm that year before
falling back to the number two slot in 2022.215

Positioned in the Persian Gulf atop the world’s largest natural gas
field, Qatar is one of the top exporters of LNG, consistently supply-
ing about 80 million metric tons to world markets annually.216 Qatar
was the second-largest source for LNG to China in 2023, supplying
16.7  million  tons,  or  about  a  quarter  of  LNG  imports.217 According
to  testimony  from  Dr.  Downs,  this  is  set  to  increase  following  sepa-
rate  deals  signed  in  late  2022  and  2023  between  QatarEnergy  and
two Chinese state-owned energy giants, Sinopec and China National
Petroleum Corporation (CNPC).218

Gas  imports  from  Qatar  will  continue  to  play  a  critical  role  in
China’s  natural  gas  mix.  With  consumption  projected  by  Chinese
officials  to  increase,  decision-makers  in  Beijing  seek  to  expand  do-
mestic  production  capacity  while  maintaining  a  stable  and  diver-
sified  mix  of  imports  from  trusted  suppliers.219  The  2023  Natural
Gas Development Report issued by China’s National Energy Admin-
istration (NEA), CNPC, and the State Council, among others, for the
first  time  specified  the  goal  of  continuing  to  meet  above  50  percent
of  demand  with  domestic  supply.220  The  14th  Five-Year  Plan  calls
for  national  storage  capacity  of  55  to  60  bcm  by  2025,  and  Chi-
nese  shipbuilders  are  increasing  production  of  large  LNG  carriers
from 7 percent of global orders in 2021 up to 30 percent in 2022.221
Analysis  coauthored  by  hearing  witness  Dr.  Downs  predicts  China
will  seek  to  secure  a  baseline  of  domestic  production  and  pipeline
imports  while  maintaining  the  ability  to  dial  up  or  dial  down  LNG
imports in response to global gas prices.222

China Positions Itself on Clean Energy Investment

China  has  become  a  leading  manufacturer  of  clean  energy  tech-
nologies  at  the  same  time  wealthy  Gulf  states  aim  to  transition
their  economies  from  dependence  on  fossil  fuel  exports,  presenting
natural  opportunities  for  increased  integration  of  Chinese  compa-
nies  in  the  region.223  The  International  Energy  Agency  estimates
renewable  energy  capacity  to  grow  by  62  gigawatts  (GW)  between
2023 and 2028 in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region,
more than three times the growth during the previous five-year pe-
riod.224 And an estimate by UBS Investment Bank projects total an-
nual energy-related trade between China and the region to increase
by  $423  billion  by  the  year  2030,  with  renewables  accounting  for
$77 billion of this additional trade.225

Nuclear

Chinese  construction  companies  have  partnered  with  Gulf  coun-
tries to build nuclear reactors. The UAE leads the region in adopting
nuclear  power,  with  its  multi-reactor  Barakah  power  plant  coming
partially  online  in  2020. The  first  nuclear  power  plant  in  the Arab
world, it is expected to meet up to 25 percent of the country’s daily
energy  needs  once  fully  operational.226  In  May  2023,  the  Emirates
Nuclear  Energy  Corporation  reached  agreements  with  three  Chi-
nese  nuclear  energy  companies  to  support  its  nuclear  energy  pro-
gram,  and  Saudi  Arabia  is  reportedly  considering  similar  partner-
ships with China to build reactors capable of supplying 17 GWe * of
nuclear capacity by 2040.227

Batteries/Electric Vehicles

Chinese  automotive  companies  are  rapidly  expanding  market
share  in  the  region  as  adoption  of  electric  vehicles  (EVs)  is  set  to
rise. The  market  for  EVs  in  GCC  countries  is  estimated  to  be  $4.4
billion  in  2024  and  is  expected  to  grow  to  $10.4  billion  by  2029.228
Chinese carmakers of all types have made rapid inroads in the Gulf,
going  from  less  than  1  percent  market  share  for  new  vehicle  sales
in  2017  to  12  percent  in  2022,  paving  the  way  for  expansion  of  EV
sales  as  adoption  rates  increase.229  In  the  UAE,  Chinese  EV  sales
were  up  92  percent  year-over-year  during  the  first  five  months  of
2024,  admittedly  from  a  small  base.230  China’s  lithium  battery  ex-
ports  have  also  accelerated  in  recent  years  to  GCC  countries,  in-
creasing  26  percent  year-over-year  in  2022  and  another  99  percent
in the first three quarters of 2023.231 In Israel—where the EV mar-
ket  is  projected  to  grow  from  $3  billion  in  2023  to  $12.9  billion  by
2032—Chinese  EVs  accounted  for  68  percent  of  all  EV  sales  from
January to May of 2024.232

Saudi  Arabia  has  staked  out  a  path  to  become  an  EV  manufac-
turing  hub,  with  the  country’s  largest  sovereign  wealth  fund,  Pub-
lic  Investment  Fund  (PIF),  taking  a  majority  ownership  position  in
California-based luxury EV maker Lucid Motors in 2021, paving the
way  for  opening  the  first  manufacturing  facility  in  the  country  in

* GWe  is  an  abbreviation  for “gigawatt  electric,”  a  unit  of  electrical  output  equivalent  to  1,000
megawatts  or  1  billion  watts.  In  2022,  94  operable  nuclear  reactors  in  the  United  States  had  a
combined net capacity of 97.0 GWe, producing 18.6 percent of the country’s electricity; China had
56 reactors with a combined net capacity of 54.4 GWe, producing 5 percent of the country’s total
electricity. World Nuclear Association, “Nuclear Power in the World Today,” September 11 2024.

2023.233  The  UAE  has  also  moved  to  build  an  EV  manufacturing
sector through collaboration with Chinese automakers.234 In Febru-
ary,  it  was  reported  that  Shanghai-based  carmaker  Nio  had  agreed
to license its technology to Forseven, an EV startup owned and con-
trolled  by  Abu  Dhabi  investment  fund  CYVN  Holdings.235  CYVN
Holdings  became  the  single-largest  shareholder  in  Nio  after  a  $2.2
billion dollar investment in December 2023, bringing its stake in the
company to 20.1 percent.236 In July 2024, China’s largest EV maker
BYD  agreed  to  a  $1  billion  deal  to  build  a  manufacturing  plant  in
Turkey  that  reportedly  will  produce  150,000  vehicles  annually.237

ing to battery technology, see Chapter 3, “U.S. China Competition in
Emerging Technologies.”)

Solar

The  Middle  East  is  set  to  become  a  sizable  market  for  Chinese
solar exports as countries scale up deployment of renewable ener-
gy. Solar photovoltaic (PV) is expected to account for 85 percent of
increased  renewable  energy  capacity  in  the  Middle  East  between
2023  and  2028.238  China’s  Silk  Road  Fund  has  a  24  percent  eq-
uity  interest  in  the  world’s  largest  solar  energy  plant  in  Dubai,
in  partnership  with  the  Dubai  Electricity  and  Water  Authority
(DEWA).239

Clean Hydrogen

Nascent technology being funded by Gulf countries as part of their
national  transition  strategies  presents  collaborative  opportunities
for  Chinese  companies  in  new  energy  systems.  Riyadh-headquar-
tered ACWA  Power  is  a  private  company  that  is  a  major  developer
and operator of power generation and desalination plants across the
Middle  East,  including  solar  and  green  hydrogen  projects.240  The
company has a number of partnerships and joint ventures with Chi-
nese guidance funds and state-owned enterprises, including the Silk
Road  Fund,  Power  Construction  Corporation  of  China,  State  Power
Investment Corporation, and Bank of China.241

Economic Statecraft

Geographically  positioned  at  a  crossroads  for  global  trade,  the
Middle  East  has  become  a  priority  for  Chinese  transportation  and
trade  infrastructure  investment  in  recent  years.  Every  country  in
the  region  except  Israel  and  Jordan  have  signed  a  memorandum
of understanding (MOU) to participate in BRI.242 However, China’s
investments  in  the  region  extend  beyond  traditional  development
finance  and  are  intended  to  secure  access  to  energy  resources  and
trade infrastructure like ports in key locations. In testimony before
the  Commission,  Karen  Young,  senior  research  scholar  at  Colum-
bia  University’s  Center  on  Global  Energy  Policy,  described  China’s
statecraft  objective  as  follows:  “The  goal  for  China  is  not  to  be  a
security  umbrella,  a  regional  alliance  or  solely  to  gain  a  market
for  exports.  China  is  after  energy  resources  and  strategic  locations
for  its  trade  and  transport  security,  which  means  it  is  invested  in
certain choke points in the Middle East, Horn of Africa, and Indian
Ocean.” 243

Port and Special Economic Zone Investments

In efforts to become a preeminent trade and logistics hub for both
the  European  market  and  emerging  markets  in  Asia  and  Africa,
Gulf  countries  have  been  expanding  port  infrastructure  positioned
along  strategic  waterways.  Chinese  companies  have  been  increas-
ingly  involved  in  construction  and  operation  of  port  infrastructure
throughout the region. Notable investments include:

 • Suez  Canal  (Egypt):  Chinese  private  and  state-owned  compa-
nies  have  signed  numerous  deals  seeking  to  acquire  operating
concessions and ownership stakes in port and industrial activity
along  the  Suez  Canal,  through  which  12  percent  of  the  world’s
trade  flows  annually.244  The  Tianjin  Economic-Technological
Development  Area  (TEDA)  Suez  Economic  and  Trade  Cooper-
ation  Zone  is  a  176-square-mile  industrial  area  built  jointly  by
the  governments  of  China  and  Egypt.245  The  project  was  an-
nounced in 2000, undergoing significant expansion in 2016 with
substantial Chinese investment after being held up as a model
BRI project.246 Last year, Chinese companies signed deals worth
more than $8 billion to operate and manage assets in the Suez
Canal  Economic  Zone.247  With  respect  to  ports,  Hong  Kong-
based Hutchison Ports invested more than $1.5 billion for up to
38-year operating concessions in Egyptian ports, including oper-
ation  of  a  terminal  at Abu  Qir  Naval  Base.248  Shanghai-based
COSCO Shipping Lines Co. acquired a 20 percent stake in East
Port Said at the north end of the canal and a 25 percent stake
in a terminal at Ain Sokhna Port on the south end.249

 • Port  of  Duqm  (Oman):  Strategically  positioned  near  the  Strait
of  Hormuz  and  the  Bab-al-Mandeb,  this  port  is  owned  by  the
Government  of  Oman  and  operated  by  a  government  entity.250
The  Chinese  consortium  Oman  Wanfang  committed  to  a  $3.7
billion  investment  over  30  years  to  build  a  Special  Economic
Zone.251

 • Port of Aden (Yemen): China Merchants Port Holdings is one of

the firms involved in operations of this port.252

 • Khalifa  Port  (UAE):  In  2021,  U.S.  intelligence  agencies  warned
of  suspected  Chinese  projects  to  construct  military  facilities  at
this port 50 miles north of Abu Dhabi.253 The UAE maintained
that the construction carried out by COSCO was commercial in
nature,  though  it  announced  it  would  halt  the  project  shortly
thereafter  following  stern  warnings  from  U.S.  officials.254  (For
more  on  the  potential  use  of  dual-use  facilities  for  military
purposes,  see “China’s  Military  and  Security  Presence  in  the
Region” later in this chapter.) In 2024, the China Harbor Engi-
neering Company was awarded a contract to upgrade the Ras al
Khaimah Saqr Port, another UAE port north of Dubai.255

RMB and Alternative Payments Make Inroads, Albeit Minor

China  seeks  to  protect  itself  from  exposure  to  potential  future
U.S.  sanctions  and  views  energy  markets  and  trade  with  countries
in  the  Middle  East  as  one  avenue  through  which  it  might  dislodge
the  U.S.  dollar’s  dominance  in  international  finance.  (For  more  on

363

China’s  efforts  to  create  an  alternative  to  the  dollar-based  trade
and  financing  system,  see  Chapter  7,  “China’s  New  Measures  for
Control, Mobilization, and Resilience.”) In the run-up to the 25-year
strategic  partnership  agreement  signed  in  2021,  the  central  bank
of  Iran  listed  the  renminbi  (RMB)  as  the  Islamic  Republic’s  main
reserve  currency.256  The  adoption  of  the  RMB  by  Iran  for  a  sub-
stantial  portion  of  its  foreign  exchange  reserves  and  cross-border
payments  is  unique  given  the  imposition  of  harsh  sanctions  ban-
ning Iranian banks from the SWIFT payment system since 2018.257
There are currently practical limits to these efforts, however. China
has  pushed  RMB-denominated  oil  contracts,  cross-border  payment
agreements,  and  currency  swap  lines  with  countries  in  the  region,
most  recently  signing  a  three-year  currency  swap  agreement  with
Saudi Arabia  worth  nearly  $7  billion.258 The  currencies  of  all  GCC
countries  except  Kuwait  are  pegged  to  the  dollar,  and  this  along
with  China’s  capital  controls  and  the  decades-old  oil-for-security
partnership  with  the  United  States  creates  a  strong  incentive  for
Arab  Gulf  countries  to  continue  pricing  their  energy  exports  and
accruing foreign exchange reserves in dollars.259 According to testi-
mony from Dr. Downs before the Commission, no country in the re-
gion besides Iran has accepted RMB for payment for energy exports,
though  Iraq  and  the  UAE  have  both  shown  interest  in  introducing
the RMB for non-oil private sector cross-border payments.260

BRI  and  Development  Finance  Expands,  Bucking  Global

Trend

As  China  has  pulled  back  development  financing  globally  in  re-
cent  years,  in  the  Middle  East  such  investment  has  continued  and
in some places increased (see also the “Digital Silk Road” section be-
low). Between 2005 and 2022, 266 projects were initiated across the
region under the umbrella of BRI, according to data collected by the
International  Institute  for  Strategic  Studies.261  With  its  extensive
oil reserves and participation in BRI, Iraq has become a top destina-
tion  for  Chinese  energy  and  infrastructure  investment.262  In  2021,
Iraq was the top recipient of BRI funding, receiving about $10.5 bil-
lion.263 Iraqi oil exports to China increased 47.5 percent from 2021
to 2022, and as of the start of this year, two-thirds of Iraq’s current
oil production is operated and overseen by Chinese companies.264

The  United  States  has  coordinated  a  program  to  counter  Chi-
na’s  BRI  and  establish  alternate  trade  routes  through  the  Mid-
dle  East.  The  Partnership  for  Global  Infrastructure  and  Invest-
ment  (PGII)  was  announced  at  the  G7  summit  in  Japan  in  May
2023.265 Under the auspices of this framework, the United States,
India, the EU, France, Germany, Italy, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE
signed an MOU five months later to build two economic corridors
connecting  South  Asia  and  Europe  via  the  Middle  East,  brand-
ed  the  India-Middle  East-Europe  Economic  Corridor  (IMEC).266
The  proposal  calls  for  building  rail  and  shipping  lines  to  connect
existing  infrastructure  to  move  goods  between  India,  the  UAE,
Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Israel, and Europe.267 Telecommunications
lines,  undersea  cables,  and  a  clean  hydrogen  pipeline  are  also
envisioned  in  the  proposal.268

China-Middle East Technology Relations

As  the  technology  competition  between  the  United  States  and
China has intensified, the Middle East is emerging as a key stake-
holder and potential conduit for Chinese end users to gain access
to  leading-edge  technology.  Chinese  technology  companies  have
had  market  presence  in  the  region  for  decades  and  are  working
to  deploy  telecommunications  equipment  and  other  underlying
technology  infrastructure  across  the  region  in  both  wealthy  and
underdeveloped countries. Emerging technologies like AI and ad-
vanced  computing  play  a  central  role  in  the  ambitious  national
strategies of GCC countries as they seek to diversify their econo-
mies  away  from  reliance  on  fossil  fuel.  Countries  like  Saudi Ara-
bia,  the  UAE,  and  Qatar  have  dedicated  massive  investment  to
build  up  domestic  technology  industry  and  innovation  hubs.  As
demand  for  technology  rises—including  sensitive  tech  subject  to
U.S.  export  restrictions—the  United  States  and  China  will  be  in
competition  for  market  access  and  network  effects  across  the  re-
gion.

Digital Silk Road

The Middle East is integral to China’s Digital Silk Road (DSR),
a  BRI  initiative  that  seeks  to  entrench  Chinese  technology  com-
panies  in  foreign  markets  and  digital  infrastructure.269  The  no-
tion  was  first  presented  as  the “information  silk  road”  in  a  2015
white paper outlining an expanded vision of BRI that would seek
to construct cross-border fiberoptic cables and telecommunication
networks, intercontinental underwater cables, and satellite infor-
mation  channels.270  The  DSR  has  since  evolved  to  cover  5G  cel-
lular infrastructure, cloud computing and data centers, smart city
technology, and e-commerce and digital payment services.271 Con-
sistent  with  its  approach  to  BRI,  China  broadly  defines  DSR  by
design  in  order  to  lump  a  range  of  overseas  investment  projects
and initiatives under the umbrella of a seemingly coherent devel-
opment strategy. Mohammed Soliman, director of the Middle East
Institute’s  Strategic  Technologies  and  Cyber  Security  Program,
observed,  “By  utilizing  technology  statecraft,  Beijing  aims  to  es-
tablish China’s geopolitical footprint in the region without resort-
ing  to  conventional  military  expansion.” 272  As  of  late  2023,  at
least 17 countries have signed formal MOUs to join the DSR glob-
ally,  among  them  Egypt, Turkey,  Saudi Arabia,  and  the  UAE.273

Huawei and Others Deeply Embed in Technology Infrastructure
Chinese  telecommunications  companies  Huawei  and  ZTE  have
moved aggressively to expand their presence in the Middle East and
developing countries more broadly since coming under scrutiny from
the  United  States  and  its  allies  and  partners  over  data  security
concerns.275 As of early 2023, Huawei had contracts with 11 Middle
Eastern  countries  to  build  out  5G  infrastructure,  including  Egypt,
Turkey, Iran, Lebanon, Jordan, and all six GCC countries.276 Devel-

oping countries seeking to modernize their telecommunications net-
works have been attracted to the low-cost products offered by Huawei
and  ZTE  that  still  perform  relatively  well  compared  to  equipment
from non-Chinese competitors.277 Huawei has been deeply involved
in  Egypt  for  decades,  establishing  its  North  African  headquarters
in  Cairo  in  1999.278  In  2018,  Huawei  and  state-controlled  Telecom
Egypt  signed  a  $200  million  financing  agreement  backed  by  the
Bank  of  China  and  China  Export  &  Credit  Insurance  Corporation
(Sinosure)  to  fund  the  establishment  of  a  national  4G  network.279
And  despite  previous  false  starts,  in  2024  Telecom  Egypt  secured
the  exclusive  license  from  the  government  worth  $150  million  to
provide 5G services enabled by Huawei technologies.280 Huawei has
signed  similar  agreements  to  collaborate  on  5G  buildout  with  Zain
in Saudi Arabia, Etisalat in the UAE, Turk Telekom in Turkey, and
VIVA in Kuwait.281

Beyond  cellular  networks,  Chinese  firms  have  been  involved  in
the  construction  of  another  critical  piece  of  the  IT  infrastructure
in  the  region:  data  centers. The  Gulf  still  lags  behind  the  United
States,  Europe,  and Asia  in  terms  of  total  data  centers  and  data
center capacity. Saudi Arabia currently has 60 data centers oper-
ating  with  123  megawatts  (MW)  of  capacity,  while  the  UAE  has
52  centers  operating  with  235  MW  as  of  the  end  of  2023.282  For
comparison,  as  of  2022  Germany  has  1,060  MW  of  data  center
capacity,  China  has  4,818  MW,  and  the  United  States  has  17,000
MW.283  However,  both  Saudi  Arabia  and  the  UAE  are  moving
to  rapidly  expand  capacity.  In  late  2021,  Saudi  Arabia’s  Minis-
try  of  Communications  and  Information Technology  set  a  goal  of
reaching  1,300  MW  of  data  center  capacity  by  2030,  and  in  the
UAE  another  343  MW  of  capacity  is  currently  planned  or  under
construction.284  Chinese  companies  Huawei,  Lenovo,  and  Inspur
have  served  as  IT  infrastructure  providers  for  equipment  used
in  data  centers,  and  cloud  service  providers Alibaba  and Tencent
have  staked  out  operation  of  data  facilities  in  both  countries.285
(For  a  discussion  of  total  compute,  including  cloud  services,  as  a
key facet of U.S.-China technology competition in AI, see Chapter
3, “U.S.-China  Competition  in  Emerging Technologies.”)

Emerging Technology

The  expanding  collaborative  regional  innovation  landscape
around  emerging  technologies  like  AI,  advanced  computing,  and
biotechnology  has  increased  the  potential  for  transfer  of  cut-
ting-edge,  dual-use  technology.  Wealthy  Gulf  states  in  particular
view  increased  technological  linkages  with  China  as  an  opportu-
nity  to  accelerate  digital  initiatives  posited  in  economic  diversi-
fication  plans  like  Saudi  Arabia’s  Vision  2030.286  Gulf  sovereign
wealth  funds  have  been  major  investors  in  tech  startups  around
the  world  for  over  a  decade,  yet  now  they  have  set  goals  to  de-
velop  domestic  technology  industries  modeled  on  Silicon  Valley
as  part  of  their  national  diversification  strategies.287  China  may
be  able  to  use  its  role  as  a  partner  in  building  these  burgeoning
ecosystems  to  both  expand  its  influence  in  the  region  and  evade
export  controls  imposed  by  the  United  States  and  other Western
countries  to  obtain  sensitive  dual-use  technology.

Artificial Intelligence Opens New Front of Tech Competition

Technology  partnerships  between  Chinese  companies  of  concern
and AI startups in the Middle East present a new vector of vulner-
ability of sensitive technology and data transfer.* The wealthy Arab
Gulf  countries  have  made  clear  their  ambition  to  become  AI  lead-
ers,  allocating  massive  investment  into  planned  construction  of  AI
infrastructure  and  regional  innovation  hubs.  The  consultancy  PwC
estimates  the  economic  contribution  of  AI  will  be  13.6  percent  of
gross domestic product (GDP) in the UAE and 12.4 percent in Saudi
Arabia by 2030, behind only China and the United States.288 Of the
96  strategic  goals  included  in  Saudi  Arabia’s  Vision  2030,  some  70
percent  involve  using  data  and AI.289 The  UAE  stood  up  an Artifi-
cial Intelligence and Advanced Technology Council in January 2024
to  guide  AI  policy,  and  the  following  month  the  country’s  largest
listed  firm,  International  Holding  Co.,  appointed  an  AI  chatbot  to
an  observer  post  on  its  board.290  The  sheer  amount  of  resources—
both capital and energy—required to build data processing capacity
that enables cutting-edge applications of AI are only accessible to a
handful of actors worldwide, yet they are two resources abundant in
Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Qatar.

Gulf Sovereign Wealth Funds Make Big Bets on AI

A  frenzy  of  deal-making  has  commenced  between  Gulf  funds  and
AI  companies  in  China  and  elsewhere  since  the  launch  of  ChatGPT-3
in  November  2022.  Saudi Arabia’s  Public  Investment  Fund  (PIF)  was
the most active  investor among the world’s sovereign  wealth funds in
2023, investing $31.6 billion across 49 separate deals, an increase of 33
percent from 2022.291 As of March 2024, the PIF had $925 billion in as-
sets under management, up from $480 billion in 2022 and putting it on
track to meet its ambitious target of $2 trillion by 2030.292 Investing in
emerging technology has been a central pillar of the PIF’s strategy to
grow its portfolio and advance priorities outlined by Vision 2030.293 In
2017, the PIF was the top investor in the SoftBank Vision Fund—the
world’s  largest  technology  venture  capital  fund—providing  $45  billion
of  the  initial  $100  billion  in  capital  alongside  other  investors  such  as
Japan’s SoftBank, the Emeriti sovereign wealth fund Mubadala, Apple,
Foxconn,  and  Qualcomm.294 The Vision  Fund  has  recently  announced
it  is  pivoting  toward  strategic  investment  in  AI  and  semiconductors,
with  SoftBank  executives  pronouncing  their  size  will  enable  them  to
create an ecosystem of AI startups that can pool resources and rapidly
scale to outcompete other investors.295 Notable investment deals relat-
ing to China include:

 • Prosperity7  Ventures  investment  in  Zhipu  AI:  In  May  2024  the
Financial  Times  reported  that  the  technology  venture  capital
division  of  Saudi  Aramco  called  Prosperity7  had  invested  in
Chinese  generative  AI  startup  Zhipu  AI.296  Though  details  of
the deal were not made public by either party, Prosperity7 was
reportedly  a  minority  investor  in  a  $400  million  funding  round
that  valued  Zhipu  at  roughly  $3  billion.297 This  is  the  first  in-
stance  of  a  foreign  investor  backing  a  Chinese  generative  AI

company  endeavoring  to  rival  industry  leaders  like  OpenAI.298
According to Gregory Allen, the director of the Center for Stra-
tegic  and  International  Studies  Wadhwani  Center  for  AI  and
Advanced Technologies, the deal also raises questions on wheth-
er  Zhipu  will  be  able  to  access  advanced  compute  powered  by
leading-edge  semiconductors  through  operations  in  Saudi  Ara-
bia.299  Founded  in  2019,  Zhipu  AI  is  one  of  the  more  notable
startups  in  generative  AI  and  first  to  secure  Chinese  govern-
ment  approval  for  roll-out  of  its  products,  with  backing  from
Alibaba Group and Tencent.300

 • Alat  partnerships  in  AI  and  semiconductor  industry:  Alat  is  a
$100  billion  investment  firm  launched  by  the  PIF  in  February
2024  with  the  stated  mission  of  developing  Saudi Arabia’s  pro-
duction  and  manufacturing  of  advanced  technology  industries,
including AI and semiconductors.301 Since then it has announced
a  number  of  deals  with  Chinese  companies,  including  a  $2  bil-
lion partnership with Lenovo to set up a regional headquarters
and a new manufacturing base and a $200 million joint venture
with  surveillance  company  Dahua  to  develop  its  first  overseas
manufacturing  operations.302  In  recognition  of  the  increasing-
ly  precarious  position  his  firm  occupies  amid  the  intensifying
U.S.-China technology competition, Alat CEO Amit Midha made
clear that partnering with U.S. firms was a top priority, stating
that  the  fund  would  be  willing  to  unwind  its  Chinese  invest-
ments if asked by U.S. officials.303

U.S. Expands Technology Transfer Restrictions to Region

Increased  concern  surrounding  Chinese  end  users’  ability  to  by-
pass  U.S.  export  controls  through  third  countries  has  led  to  an  ex-
pansion of the list of restricted markets for leading-edge products. In
October  2023,  the  Commerce  Department  expanded  semiconductor
export  controls  to  require  licenses  for  sale  of  cutting-edge  NVIDIA
and  AMD  chips  to  certain  Middle  Eastern  countries,  including  the
UAE  and  Saudi Arabia,  consistent  with  prior  rules  to  prevent  Chi-
nese military end use.304 In July 2023, the Financial Times reported
the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS)
was investigating a planned $3 billion investment by the Abu Dhabi
sovereign  wealth  fund  Mubadala  to  buy  a  majority  stake  in  New
York-based  Fortress  Investment  Group  over  concerns  of  technology
transfer due to close ties between the emirate and China.305

Group 42 Exemplifies Challenges and Possible Approach
to Technological Disentanglement

One  of  the  leading AI  companies  in  the  Middle  East  moved  to
sever ties with Chinese firms in favor of expanded access to U.S.
technology  following  pressure  from  both  the  Administration  and
Congress.  Founded  in  2018,  Group  42  (G42)  serves  as  a  central

Group 42 Exemplifies Challenges and Possible Approach
to Technological Disentanglement—Continued
and  chaired  by  Sheikh Tahnoon  bin  Zayed,  national  security  ad-
visor and brother to Abu Dhabi’s crown prince.

In  November  2023,  the  New  York  Times  first  reported  on  con-
cerns raised by U.S. intelligence officials over G42’s extensive ties
with Chinese companies, including underlying hardware provided
by  Huawei,  cooperation  with  BGI  on  genetic  sequencing,  and  a
$100  million  stake  in  ByteDance  carried  out  by  its  $10  billion
private  equity  investment  arm  42XFund.307  High-level  officials
in  the Administration  reportedly  told  their  Emirati  counterparts
that when it came to cutting-edge emerging technologies, the UAE
needed  to  choose  between  partnership  with  the  United  States  or
China.308  In  January  2024,  the  House  Select  Committee  on  the
CCP  called  for  the  Commerce  Department  to  make  a  determi-
nation  on  whether  G42  and  its  subsidiaries  should  be  added  to
the  Entity  List  due  to  potential  transfer  of  dual-use  technology
to Chinese military end users.309 Prior to the Select Committee’s
letter,  G42’s  CEO  said  in  an  interview  that  his  company  cannot
work  with  both  sides,  and  in  February  it  had  sold  holdings  in
Chinese  companies  and  broken  ties  with  hardware  suppliers,  in-
cluding Huawei.310

Microsoft  and  G42  announced  a  $1.5  billion  “strategic  invest-
ment”  agreement  in April  16,  2024,  following “close  consultation”
with both the U.S. and Emirati governments.311 The deal afforded
access  to  Microsoft  cloud  services  for  AI  applications,  a  seat  for
Microsoft  Vice  Chair  and  President  Brad  Smith  on  the  board  of
G42, and commitments by both parties to adhere to shared stan-
dards  on AI  development  and  technology  sharing  in  the  develop-
ing  world.312  Mr.  Soliman  said  in  testimony  before  the  Commis-
sion  that  the  agreement  could  serve  as  a  model  for  engagement
with the technology goals and companies of Middle East countries
while establishing guardrails for U.S. technology and intellectual
property  in  the  region.313  The  UAE’s  ambassador  to  the  Unit-
ed States said after the deal that the two country’s governments
were  aligned  in  their  vision  for  AI  and  would  be  “partners  at
the  leading  edge  of  advanced  computing  technologies.” 314  White
House  technology  advisor  Tarun  Chhabra  described  the  deal  as
generally  positive,  saying  the  United  States  has  an  interest  in
moving  countries  in  the  Middle  East  away  from  close  ties  with
companies like Huawei.315

Smart Cities and Surveillance Technology

The expertise of Chinese companies in deploying low-cost surveil-
lance  technologies  at  scale  has  presented  an  enticing  value  propo-
sition  for  authoritarian  regimes  seeking  innovative  ways  to  tighten
state  control. The  collective  term “smart  cities”  commonly  refers  to
the application of digital technologies in an urban setting to collect
and  analyze  data  in  order  to  optimize  municipal  management  and
services.316  While  smart  city  technology  can  greatly  improve  effi-
ciency and accelerate development in emerging market economies, it

370

also raises concerns over privacy and the export globally of China’s
repressive  mass  surveillance  model  used  in  Xinjiang  Province  and
elsewhere throughout the country.317

Digital transformation of society has become a central pillar of the
national diversification strategies of wealthy Gulf nations like Saudi
Arabia,  the  UAE,  and  Qatar,  who  partner  with  a  variety  of  foreign
technology  firms  and  providers  of  smart  city  technology.318 Accord-
ing  to  the  2023  Smart  City  Index,  a  ranking  of  141  cities  along  a
variety  of  infrastructure  and  technology  metrics, Abu  Dhabi  placed
13th  in  the  world,  Dubai  17th,  and  Riyadh  30th.319  Projects  under
development  like  Saudi  Arabia’s  planned  futuristic  city  NEOM  on
the Red Sea intend to expand the integration of data to ease friction
in daily life of residents, with city planners stating that the city will
make use of 90 percent of collectible data, in comparison to current
smart  cities  that  typically  utilize  around  1  percent.320  Huawei  has
signed contracts to provide cloud services for NEOM, as has Chinese
AI company SenseTime.321 In early 2024, Saudi fund Alat (a subsid-
iary  of  the  PIF)  announced  a  $200  million  partnership  with  Dahua
Technology,  a  leading  Chinese  surveillance  equipment  maker  that
was  added  to  the  Commerce  Department’s  Entity  List  in  2022  for
its role in surveillance of Uyghurs.322 Elsewhere in the region, Chi-
nese  technology  is  being  embedded  in  Egypt’s  New  Administrative
Capital,  a  planned  city  for  6.5  million  residents  under  construction
with  sizable  contribution  from  China  State  Construction  Engineer-
ing  Corporation  (CSCEC).323  Furthermore,  in  both  Qatar  and  the
UAE, Huawei is involved in new smart city development projects.324

China’s  Military  and  Security  Presence  in  the

Middle  East

China has slowly been expanding its security footprint in the Mid-
dle East. It has built a military outpost in the region, is carrying out
counterpiracy  activities,  participating  in  peacekeeping  operations,
and conducting military exercises and port calls with regional part-
ners. Some analysts argue that China may view dual-use ports as a
potential  way  to  expand  its  security  options  in  the  region,  as  well.
Although its military presence in the region remains limited and it
has  shown  little  interest  in  playing  a  larger  role  in  regional  secu-
rity,  these  activities  allow  Beijing  to  bolster  the  PLA’s  operational
experience and its reputation as a security partner. Lastly, China is
targeting  customers  in  the  Middle  East  arms  market,  particularly
through  the  sale  of  drones,  to  establish  itself  as  an  alternative  op-
tion to the United States and Russia.

PLA  Activities  in  the  Middle  East  Boost  Operational

Experience

China’s military footprint in the Middle East is relatively small at
present,  especially  compared  to  the  United  States’  presence,  but  it
enables China to gain operational experience and could lay the foun-
dation  for  a  larger  military  presence  in  the  region  in  the  future.325
In  recent  years,  one  of  China’s  top  military  objectives  in  the  region
has been protecting its investments.326 Toward this end, China has
deployed PLA assets to participate in UN peacekeeping efforts, and
it  has  potentially  begun  scoping  locations  for  formal  military  bases

371

and  commercial  ports  where  the  PLA  Navy  can  dock  its  ships.327
The  PLA’s  efforts  to  operate  more  frequently  in  the  Middle  East
could  enhance  China’s  efforts  to  project  power  and  compete  with
the U.S. military on a global scale.328 At this point in time, though,
Chinese military operations in the region are marginal compared to
those of the United States.

China Could Expand Basing Footprint in the Future

Though  there  are  currently  no  official  Chinese  military  bases  in
the  Middle  East,  a  logistics  facility  in  Djibouti  already  serves  as  a
PLA  military  outpost,  supporting  regional  military  operations  and
representing  a  potential  model  for  expanding  its  security  footprint
in  the  future.329  While  the  Djibouti  installation  is  China’s  only  of-
ficial  military  outpost,  Beijing  could  establish  similar  facilities  in
the  future.* 330  A  2022  report  on  China’s  global  basing  ambitions
by  RAND  Corporation  researchers  Cristina  L.  Garafola,  Stephen
Watts,  and  Kristin  J.  Leuschner  analyzed  the  desirability  and  fea-
sibility of potential PLA basing and access locations, assessing that
countries  including  Bahrain,  Kuwait,  Oman,  Qatar,  Saudi  Arabia,
and  the  UAE  were  likely  highly  desirable  locations  for  PLA  bas-
ing  and  access  points,  although  the  feasibility  of  these  varied.331
The  U.S.  Department  of  Defense’s  2023  report  on  Military  and  Se-
curity  Developments  Involving  the  PRC  notes  that  China “probably
also  has  considered  other  countries  as  locations  for  PLA  military
logistics  facilities,”  including  the  UAE.332 Additionally,  according  to
a  2020  study  written  for  the  Commission  by  the  open  source  in-
telligence  company  Jane’s,  two  of  the  18  sites  that  could  serve  as
potential  overseas  PLA  bases  are  located  in  the  Middle  East  (both
in Oman).333

Some  analysts  have  argued  that  whether  or  not  it  adds  actual
bases,  China  may  be  able  to  rely  on  access  to  critical  infrastruc-
ture in the Middle East as a way of expanding its power projection
capabilities in the region.334 Grant Rumley, the Meisel-Goldberg-
er fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, argues
that  China  will  likely  continue  to  augment  its  security  presence
in  the  Middle  East  through  “a  combination  of  modest  military
deployments  and  investments  in  critical  infrastructure.” 335  Chi-
na’s  2016  National  Defense  Transportation  Law  gives  the  PLA
legal  authority  to  commandeer  civilian  facilities,  such  as  ports,
in  times  of  crisis.336  As  noted  by  Conor  Kennedy,  an  assistant
professor  at  the  China  Maritime  Studies  Institute,  the  2016  law
requires  Chinese  transportation  enterprises  overseas  to  provide
logistical  support  for  PLA  forces  operating  overseas.337  PLA  ex-
perts  have  discussed  the  importance  of  “strategic  strongpoints,”
a  term  that  “generally  refers  to  potential  dual-use  overseas  fa-
cilities,  including  foreign  commercial  ports  over  which  the  PRC

* China primarily uses its Djibouti base to conduct antipiracy and freedom of navigation activi-
ties that are aimed at securing trade corridors in the region. The PLA Navy has utilized Djibouti
as a logistics hub for its anti-piracy missions in the Gulf of Aden since 2008, and evacuated Chi-
nese  and  foreign  civilians  there  in  2015  during  a  surge  of  violence  in Yemen,  after  which  China
and Djibouti reached an agreement to build a permanent base in January 2016. Mordechai Chazi-
za,  “China’s  Military  Base  in  Djibouti,”  Begin-Sadat  Center  for  Strategic  Studies,  August  2018;

expects  to  exert  some  degree  of  control”  and  that  are  primarily
useful  for  peacetime  operations,  “enabling  PLA  Navy  port  calls,
joint  exercises,  and  antipiracy  operations  in  distant  theaters.” 338
A  host  country’s  willingness  to  support  the  PLA’s  operations
is  more  important  than  Chinese  law,  however,  as  longstanding
U.S.  experience  demonstrates  significant  constraints  imposed
by  host  countries,  particularly  during  times  of  increased  global
tensions.339  In  the  Middle  East,  Chinese  firms  have  port  operat-
ing  agreements  with  Egypt,  Israel,  Iraq,  Kuwait,  Saudi  Arabia,
Turkey,  and  the  UAE.* 340  (See “Port  and  Special  Economic  Zone
Investments” above for a more detailed discussion of certain Chi-
nese  port-related  investments  in  the  region.)

Beijing  Leverages  Counterpiracy  Task  Force

to  Gain

Experience Operating Overseas

While China has used antipiracy operations in the Middle East
to  protect  its  trade  and  gain  operational  experience,  these  oper-
ations  do  not  seem  connected  to  aforementioned  regional  efforts
dealing  with  Houthi  rebels.  In  December  2008,  China  responded
to  the  rise  in  piracy  in  the  Red  Sea  and  Gulf  of Aden,  primarily
from Somalia, by dispatching a Naval Escort Task Force (NETF),
or counterpiracy task force, to the Gulf of Aden.341 The NETF has
mostly  sustained  the  same  configuration  of  vessels:  two  surface
combatants  and  a  refueling  ship,  although  the  task  force  has  oc-
casionally  augmented  its  presence  with  other  capabilities  such
as  the  Song-class  diesel-electric  submarine.342  Since  2008,  China
has  maintained  its  counterpiracy  missions,  gaining  operational
experience  and  escorting  a  number  of  commercial  ships  through
the  Red  Sea.343  Chinese  state  media  claims  that  since  2008,  the
PLA Navy has escorted more than 7,000 commercial ships.344 Ac-
cording to an August 2024 report by independent analyst Dennis
J.  Blasko,  since  December  2008,  the  PLA  Navy  has  deployed  46
counterpiracy  escort  task  forces  to  the  Gulf  of Aden  on  a  UN-au-
thorized  mission.345  Mr.  Blasko  asserts  that  until  recently,  the
PLA Navy had normally dispatched three task forces per year at
roughly  four-month  intervals,  but  the  45th  and  46th  task  forces
departed  from  China  on  five-month  intervals,  potentially  indi-
cating  a  shift  in  deployment  patterns.346  Mr.  Blasko  states  that
the  more  onerous  requirements  for  its  surface  fleet  in  operations
around Taiwan and the South China Sea may be forcing the PLA
Navy to draw forces away from the Gulf of Aden mission, while it
also may be possible that the PLA Navy is trying to keep its ships
clear  of  waters  threatened  by  Houthi  terrorists.347

* According  to  Isaac  B.  Kardon,  a  senior  fellow  for  China  studies  at  the  Carnegie  Endowment
for  International  Peace,  Chinese  firms  partially  owned  or  operated  20  ports  in  the  Middle  East
and  North Africa  region  as  of  February  2020. These  ports  may  allow  the  PLA  Navy  to  perform
valuable  military  functions  for  logistics,  intelligence,  and  communications  without  the  estab-
lishment  of  formal  PLA  facilities  and  permissions.  Isaac  B.  Kardon,  written  testimony  for  the

Despite the NETF’s longstanding presence, the PLA Navy has ig-
nored  distress  calls  from  commercial  vessels  under  attack  in  the
Red  Sea  in  contravention  of  customary  and  international  maritime
law,  content  to  free-ride  on  U.S.-led  international  counterpiracy  op-
erations.349 For instance, in November 2023, a Liberian-flagged ves-
sel targeted by Iran-aligned Houthi rebels with missiles put out an
SOS  call  in  the  Gulf  of  Aden,  but  the  three  PLA  Navy  vessels  in
the area did not respond.350 Despite being heavily reliant on access
to  and  safe  transit  of  the  Red  Sea  for  trade  with  Middle  Eastern
partners,  Chinese  leaders  continue  to  avoid  any  outright  critique
of  the  Houthis.351 At  a  January  2023  press  conference  in  Cairo,  for
example,  Minister Wang  simply  called  for  an  end  to  the  attacks  on

mentioning the terrorist group.352 Instead, China continues to bene-

rebels.† 353

Chinese Maritime Shipping Free-Rides on
U.S.-Provided Security

The  spillover  from  the  conflict  in  Gaza  has  highlighted  the
limits  of  China’s  willingness  to  play  an  active  security  role  in
the  region.354  As  noted  above,  although  China  has  participat-
ed  in  counterpiracy  patrols  in  the  Gulf  of  Aden  since  2008,  it
has avoided participating in efforts to protect Red Sea shipping
lanes as the threat of Houthi attacks forces ships to reroute.355
The fallout has been particularly harmful to Egypt, where Chi-
na  has  billions  of  dollars’  worth  of  loans  and  investments.356
While  Minister Wang  called  for  the  end  to  the “harassment  of
civilian ships in the Red Sea” in January, he also said strikes on
Yemen were unauthorized by the UN and that the crisis was a
“spillover of the conflict in Gaza.” 357 U.S. officials have pressed
China to influence Iran into discouraging Houthi attacks, with
China  reportedly  doing  so  in  January  2024  following  meetings
between  U.S.  Secretary  of  State Antony  Blinken,  U.S.  National
Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, and head of the CCP’s Interna-
tional Department Liu Jianchao.358 China reportedly discussed
the  matter  with  Iran  at  meetings  in  Beijing  and  Tehran  in
January 2024.359 Still, China’s lack of material support for the
U.S. effort to keep shipping lanes safe for all commercial tran-
sits  may  stem  from  the  fact  that  in  March  2024  China  and
Russia reportedly made a deal with the Houthis to refrain from
attacking  their  ships.‡ 360  Chinese  ships  had  reportedly  been
signaling their identity to avoid attack in previous months, al-
though  one  was  struck  in  what  was  likely  a  mistake.361  Chi-
na  has  maintained  a  stance  of  neutrality  between  the  Yemeni
government and its Saudi Arabian supporters, and the Houthis
and  their  Iranian  backers.362

* China is balancing its need to protect Chinese commercial vessels with its response to the Is-
rael-Palestine conflict. As a result, China has not joined the U.S.-led Operation Prosperity Guard-
ian  coalition  to  help  protect  commercial  traffic  in  the  Red  Sea.  The  coalition  includes  Bahrain,
Britain, Canada, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Seychelles, and Spain. Zhao Ziwen and

† Chinese state media has attempted to undermine the credibility of the task force and question
its  motives.  For  instance,  Xinhua,  a  state-run  media  outlet,  claimed  in  a  December  2023  article
that “many allies are unwilling to publicly announce their joining, or even to get involved at all.”
The same article asserted that the task force is an attempt by the United States “to get its allies
to  share  the  escort  costs,  or  even  drag  its  allies  into  the  conflict.”  Xinhua,  “Awkward!  United

Beijing  Seeks  to  Use  Peacekeeping  Operations  to  Bolster  Its

Image as a Contributor to Regional Security

China  participates  in  various  UN  peacekeeping  operations  that
are  intended  to  bolster  its  image  and  provide  PLA  personnel  with
overseas  military  experience.363  China  has  participated  in  UN
peacekeeping operations for more than three decades, primarily de-
ploying  peacekeepers  to  African  countries  where  China  has  signif-
icant  investments.* 364  In  the  Middle  East,  China  maintains  more
than  400  peacekeepers,  almost  all  of  whom  are  in  south  Lebanon
supporting the UN Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL).† 365 Chinese
peacekeepers in Lebanon conduct trainings and exercises with UNI-
FIL, which may give them insight into the training practices of mil-
itaries from other countries and help them hone skills that could be
used  in  operations  elsewhere.366  For  instance,  in  February  2023,  a
deputy captain within China’s peacekeeping team told Chinese state
media  that  their  recent  UNIFIL  exercise  had  focused  on  defending
their  base  camp,  rescue  operations,  psychological  counseling,  and
the  resettlement  of  people.367 According  to  China’s  Ministry  of  For-
eign Affairs, Chinese peacekeepers in Lebanon also provide medical
assistance to the locals, helping to boost China’s image in the coun-
try  and  among  other  UN  member  states.368  As  of  late  June  2024,
China also has five military observers in Israel who have joined the
UN Truce  Supervision  Organization  (UNTSO).369 The  UNTSO  was
established in 1948 during the Arab-Israeli War as the UN’s first-ev-
er  peacekeeping  operation  and  helps  maintain  a  ceasefire  and  su-
pervise the application of the armistice agreements.‡ 370

Joint  Exercises  and  Port  Calls  Help  Build  Operational

Experience and Military Image

In recent years, China has conducted joint military exercises with
and  made  port  calls  to  several  Middle  Eastern  countries,  including
both U.S. partners and adversarial states like Iran, in order to gain
operational  experience  and  build  the  PLA’s  image.  At  the  first  Chi-
na-Arab States Summit in Riyadh in December 2022, General Secre-
tary Xi delivered a speech to the 21 members of the Arab League in
which  he  proposed  “eight  major  initiatives  on  China-Arab  practical
cooperation,”  including  an  “initiative  on  security  and  stability.” § 371

* China  had  a  large  peacekeeping  presence  in  the  Democratic  Republic  of  the  Congo,  where  it
has  carried  out  mining  operations,  as  well  as  South  Sudan,  where  a  Chinese  oil  company  was
part of a consortium that extracted South Sudan’s oil. China has also placed peacekeeping forces
in  Mali  and  Liberia  to  protect  critical  infrastructure  projects  and  Chinese-funded  enterprises,
respectively. U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, 2020 Annual Report to Con-
gress, December 2020, 174–175.

† UNIFIL was created by the UN Security Council in March 1978 to confirm Israeli withdrawal
from  Lebanon  and  to  assist  the  Lebanese  government  in  restoring  its  effective  authority  in  the
area. In 2006, China sent its first peacekeeping contingent to UNIFIL. Comparatively, Indonesia
has 1,232 peacekeepers and India has 894. The United States does not currently have any peace-
keepers  in  Lebanon.  United  Nations  Peacekeeping, “Troop  and  Police  Contributions,”  March  31,

§ Chinese  state  media  said  the  initiative  will  focus  on  strengthening  strategic  dialogues  be-
tween  the  defense  departments  and  military  forces  of  China  and  the  partner  countries;  con-
ducting  exchanges  between  military  units  and  academies;  deepening  cooperation  on  maritime
security, international peacekeeping and “professional techniques”; and expanding joint exercises
and  training. As  part  of  this  initiative,  China  will  train  1,500  personnel  from  partner  countries

During the inaugural summit, all sides agreed to further cooperation
between  their  militaries,  including  in  joint  exercises.372  According
to Mr. Rumley, some of China’s exercises and port calls appear to be
more  symbolic  than  practical,  while  others  are  more  sophisticated
and have led to reciprocal exercises in China.373 Mr. Rumley asserts
that  China’s  exercises  with  Middle  East  partners  are  “designed  to
showcase the capabilities of the Chinese military, build up PLA ex-
perience, and improve China’s image as a security partner.” 374

In  recent  years,  China  conducted  several  military  exercises  with
Arab countries that seek in part to improve China’s operational ex-
perience and military image:

 • UAE: In August 2023, China and the UAE held their first joint
exercise, Falcon Shield 2023, in Xinjiang.375 Associate professor
at the Near East South Asia Center for Security Studies David
Des  Roches  describes  the  joint  exercise  as  an  “unfortunate  de-
velopment” and suggests that the UAE is trying to demonstrate
to  the  United  States  that  it  has  alternative  options  for  securi-
ty  partners.376  The  most  recent  iteration  of  the  training  exer-
cise  took  place  in  July  2024,  again  in  Xinjiang.377  During  both
exercises,  the  UAE  deployed  its  Dassault  Mirage  2000-9DAD/
EAD  fighters,  an  aircraft  also  operated  by  Taiwan’s  air  force,
potentially  giving  the  PLA  Air  Force  an  opportunity  to  gather
information on its capabilities.378

 • Saudi Arabia: China has also conducted joint naval exercises with

edition  of  the  Blue  Sword  exercises  was  held  in  2019  near  Saudi
Arabia’s  Jeddah  port,  and  the  second  edition  was  held  in  2023  in
Zhanjiang, China, at a naval brigade camp.380 Following the most
recent  event,  Chinese  media  suggested  these  exercises  were  now
“routine”  and  offered  both  countries  an  opportunity  to  learn  from
each other’s strengths, highlighting that China’s military training
system is different from Saudi Arabia’s Western-style training doc-
trine.381 The exercises focus on counterpiracy operations, including
basic training, professional training, and exercises involving simu-
lated rescue operations.* 382

 • Iran: China has also participated in military exercises with Iran.
Most recently, in March 2024, China conducted naval drills with
Iran and Russia in the Gulf of Oman.383 These exercises began
in  2018  and  are  in  their  sixth  iteration,  but  the  2024  iteration
was  the  first  time  other  countries,  including  Oman,  Pakistan,
India, and others, have been allowed to observe.384 Mr. Rumley
notes that China’s exercise with Iran and Russia is one example
of Beijing focusing on a more symbolic rather than practical op-
eration.385 During the exercise, the three militaries conducted a

China’s Growing Role in the Middle Eastern Arms Market

Although  it  is  a  relatively  small  supplier  of  arms  to  the  Middle
East  relative  to  the  United  States,*  China  has  sought  to  create
deeper  inroads  into  Middle  Eastern  countries  through  the  transfer
of  arms  and  dual-use  technologies  in  order  to  establish  itself  as  an
alternative  security  partner  in  the  region.387  China  has  attempt-
ed  to  compete  in  this  market  due  to  its  relatively  low-cost  options,
affordable  services,  and  a  lack  of  geopolitical  conditions  placed  on
sales,  among  other  factors.388  In  particular,  China  has  stood  out  as
an  exporter  of  military  drones  to  countries  such  as  Saudi  Arabia
and the UAE.389

China Targets Middle East as Market for Arms Sales

China’s sale of arms and dual-use technologies in the Middle East
simultaneously serves its own commercial interests and strengthens
its position as an alternative regional security partner at the Unit-
ed  States’  expense.  In  the  last  decade,  China  has  begun  to  refocus
arms  exports  to  the  Middle  East.† 390  Notably,  China’s  2016  Arab
Policy  Paper  called  for  increased  cooperation  between  China’s  mil-
itary  and  Arab  countries  and  to  “deepen  cooperation  on  weapons,
equipment and various specialized technologies, and carry out joint
military  exercises.” 391  General  Michael  Kurilla,  the  commander  of
U.S. Central Command, told the Senate Armed Services Committee
in  March  2023  that  China’s  arms  sales  to  the  Middle  East  had  in-
creased  by  80  percent  over  the  previous  ten  years.392  Still,  China’s
arms  sales  to  the  region—and  globally—remain  low  relative  to  the
United States and other arms exporters.‡ 393

China  markets  aircraft  as  well  as  air  and  missile  defense,  an-
ti-tank, and anti-drone systems in the region. For example, in Febru-
ary  2024,  36  Chinese  companies,  including  China  North  Industries
Corporation  and  China  National  Aero-Technology  Import  and  Ex-
port Corporation, attended the World Defense Show in Saudi Arabia
to market their services.394 Chinese companies displayed fighter jet
models,  long-range  air  and  missile  defense  systems,  and  anti-tank
systems, among other equipment.395 The PLA Air Force also demon-
strated  J-10  fighter  jets—the  first  time  China  has  displayed  them
at an international  expo.396 No new deals were publicly  announced
in 2024 for Chinese fighter jet purchases, but in 2023 the UAE gov-
ernment  signed  a  deal  to  purchase  12  Chinese  L-15A  advanced  jet
trainers.397  In  2022,  China  delivered  the  Silent  Hunter  air  defense
system  to  Saudi  Arabia.398  This  is  an  anti-drone  weapons  system
intended  to  protect  Saudi  Arabia  against  loitering  munitions  and

* According  to  data  from  the  Stockholm  International  Peace  Research  Institute,  the  United
States  constituted  the  largest  share  of  arms  export  to  the  Middle  East  between  2019  and  2023,
accounting  for  38  percent  of  total  exports.  Pieter  D.  Wezeman  et  al.,  “Trends  in  International
Arms Transfers, 2023,” Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, March 2024, 3.

† China’s  arms  exports  to  the  region  have  varied  over  time;  in  1986,  it  sent  almost  95  percent
of its arms exports to Middle East countries, but this percentage dropped significantly throughout
the 1990s and early 2000s as China reoriented its arms sales to Asian customers. Maria Mary Pa-
pageorgiou, “China’s Growing Presence in the Middle East’s Arms Race and Security Dynamics,”

the Global Arms Trade?” Center for Strategic and International Studies, May 27, 2021.

‡ Between 2019 and 2023, three of the top ten arms importers were in the Middle East: Saudi
Arabia,  Qatar,  and  Egypt.  The  United  States  remains  the  top  supplier  of  arms  to  the  region,
followed by France, Italy, and Germany. Pieter D. Wezeman, et al., “Trends in International Arms
Transfers, 2023,” Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, March 2024, 11.

Iran-backed  Houthi  drones.399  In  2017,  the  UAE  purchased  Blue
Arrow  7  anti-tank  missiles  from  China  to  arm  its  Wing  Loong-2
drone fleet.400 China delivered these purchases to the UAE in 2020,
and the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute estimates
there were around 500 missiles in the delivery.401

China Has Emerged as the Main Supplier of Military-Grade Drones

in the Middle East

China  has  positioned  itself  as  the  primary  supplier  of  drones  to
the  region,  including  to  longstanding  U.S.  security  partners  Saudi
Arabia and the UAE.402 Maria Papageorgiou, a lecturer at the Uni-
versity of Exeter, testified before the Commission that between 2016
and 2020, China’s arms sales to Saudi Arabia increased by 386 per-
cent and to the UAE by 169 percent.403 During this period, the main
types of weapons purchased from China were drones, specifically the
Wing  Loong-1  and  the  Wing  Loong-2  (see  Table  3  below).404  Sau-
di Arabia  is  also  expected  to  receive  the Wing  Loong-10,  a  high-al-
titude  drone  capable  of  carrying  several  munitions,  sometime  in
2024.405 In April 2024, Iraq received a delivery of Caihong-5 (CH-5)
unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).406 According to news reports, the
Iraqi Army Aviation  Command  had  expressed  interest  in  acquiring
CH-5  drones  since  April  2023.407  China’s  CH-5  drones  can  carry
heavier  payloads  and  have  a  longer  range  and  endurance  life  than
their  predecessors  (CH-4s).408  These  features  could  allow  for  more
effective strike missions or intelligence gathering.409

Chinese military drones are more accessible to foreign militaries,
as they are priced at roughly half the cost or less of their U.S. coun-
terparts.411  Dr.  Papageorgiou  suggests  that  the  Gulf  states  in  par-
ticular are attracted to Chinese armed drones because of their lower
cost.412 Although Chinese drones are typically of a lesser quality, the
lower  price  point  allows  countries  in  the  region  to  purchase  them
in larger quantities—an advantage in conflict zones where they can
be quickly shot down.413 Additionally, Mr. Rumley explains that re-
gional actors are incentivized to buy Chinese armed drones because
it  will  give  them  access  to  Chinese  drone  technology.414  According
to  the  U.S.  Department  of  Defense,  China  entices  countries  in  the
Middle East to buy its weapons systems, especially drones, by offer-
ing flexible payment options, gifts, and donations to the purchasing
country.415

Implications for the United States

The Middle East continues to be a volatile region where factional
and  sectarian  conflict  can  quickly  spill  over  and  threaten  the  secu-
rity and commercial interests of the United States and its allies and
partners.  While  China  does  not  yet  appear  intent  on  replacing  the
United  States  as  the  dominant  outside  power  in  the  region,  it  acts
opportunistically  to  undermine  U.S.  influence.  China’s  approach  to
the  region  is  mixed,  seeking  to  strike  a  balance  between  undertak-
ing  efforts  that  may  undermine  the  influence  of  the  United  States
while  maintaining  a  threshold  of  stability  necessary  to  ensure  un-
abated commercial activity. China may also believe that it benefits if
continued  regional  turmoil  deflects  some  U.S.  energy  and  attention
away from its own immediate periphery. However, China’s substan-
tial  economic  and  commercial  interests  in  the  region,  and  its  reli-
ance  on  key  trade  routes  that  pass  through  it,  leave  it  exposed  to
potential  disruption  if  a  significant  conflict  among  regional  powers
were to break out.

Diplomatically, the Middle East presents an opportunity for China
to promote its vision of global leadership. First, China is developing
deeper  relations  with  both  U.S.  partners  and  rivals  in  the  region.
Second, Beijing uses its three initiatives, the Global Security Initia-
tive,  Global  Development  Initiative,  and  Global  Civilization  Initia-
tive, to engage Arab states and to present an alternative vision that
appeals  to  the  region’s  autocratic  governments.  Lastly,  China  uses
multilateral forums, such as the China-Arab States Cooperation Fo-
rum,  to  spread  narratives  and  gain  support  for  issues  such  as  its
human  rights  abuses  in  Xinjiang  or  bolster  its  territorial  claims  in
the South China Sea or Taiwan.

Iran is also a crucial element of China’s efforts to undermine the
United States and the rules-based international order it leads. Chi-
na  and  Iran  harbor  a  shared  sense  of  grievance  toward  the  U.S.-
led world order. By sustaining Iran—and, indirectly, its proxy forces
throughout  the  region—Beijing  complicates  the  security  landscape
for  the  United  States  and  supports  an  effective  counterweight  to
rising  regional  powers  on  the Arabian  Peninsula.  Chinese  purchas-
es  of  sanctioned  Iranian  crude  oil  have  increased  dramatically  in
recent  years,  to  the  point  where  China  now  purchases  nearly  90
percent  of  Iranian  oil  and  in  doing  so  has  established  a  network  of

380

logistical and financial institutions to bypass U.S. and international
sanctions  regimes  against  Iran.416  This  evolving  and  increasingly
sophisticated  sanctions  circumvention  scheme  is  eroding  the  eco-
nomic leverage the United States and the international community
can  bring  to  bear  not  only  to  contain  Iran  but  also  to  use  against
other adversarial states like Russia and North Korea, who together
with  China  are  forming  what  researchers  at  the  Atlantic  Council
have dubbed the “axis of evasion.” 417 However, China’s partnership
with Iran has limits, as China acts exploitatively to purchase Irani-
an oil that cannot easily be sold to other buyers due to sanctions at
below-market  prices,  all  while  signaling  Beijing’s  unwillingness  to
enmesh  too  deeply  for  fear  of  souring  relations  with  Saudi  Arabia,
the UAE, and other important actors.418

Another area of increasing concern for the United States pertains
to  China’s  ability  to  acquire  cutting-edge  U.S.  technology  subject  to
export controls given the presence of Chinese technology companies
in  the  region’s  digital  infrastructure,  particularly  in  the Arab  Gulf.
Huawei, ZTE, and other companies on the Commerce Department’s
Entity  List  have  been  instrumental  in  the  buildout  of  telecommu-
nications and cloud infrastructure across the region. With the rapid
advent of generative AI and the ambition of Saudi Arabia, the UAE,
and other wealthy Gulf states to become AI leaders, there is acceler-
ating demand for dual-use hardware and software supplied by lead-
ing  tech  companies.  In  October  2023,  the  Commerce  Department
expanded  semiconductor  export  controls  to  require  licenses  for  sale
of cutting-edge chips to certain Middle Eastern countries, including
the  UAE  and  Saudi  Arabia,  consistent  with  prior  rules  to  prevent
Chinese  military  end  use.419  Microsoft  and  the  UAE’s  leading  AI
firm  Group  42  reached  a  landmark  agreement  in  April  2024  that
followed the latter’s commitment to untangle ties with Chinese tech
companies,  including  Huawei.  This  case  is  informative  regarding
how  best  to  incentivize  key  partners  with  whom  the  United  States
maintains close security relationships to effectively constrict poten-
tial conduits of technology transfer to China.

Lastly, though China maintains a modest maritime security pres-
ence in the Middle East operating out of its base in Djibouti, it has
yet to forward-deploy the forces necessary to conduct military oper-
ations that could rival the U.S. security architecture in the region. It
appears  for  now  that  Beijing  is  content  to  free-ride  off  the  security
that U.S. counterpiracy operations, counterterrorism operations, and
broader security partnerships provide in the region. China may also
be considering options for new bases in the region; for example, the
U.S. Department of Defense asserted in 2023 that China has proba-
bly considered the UAE for a PLA logistics facility.420 This and sim-
ilar port construction projects undertaken by Chinese companies in
areas of strategic importance should be closely monitored, as should
arms sales and increasing military ties between the PLA and coun-
tries in the region.

CHAPTER 6: KEY ECONOMIC STRATEGIES FOR
LEVELING THE U.S.-CHINA PLAYING FIELD

Abstract

Many of China’s economic, technological, and military policies are
at  the  expense  of  and  contrary  to  U.S.  and  allied  interests.  Today,
China continues to flood global markets with exports in an attempt
to  boost  its  domestic  economic  growth  while  simultaneously  pursu-
ing  the  development  of  emerging  technologies  to  assert  its  global
geopolitical  interests  and  spur  military  modernization.  In  response,
the  United  States’  economic  approach  toward  China  is  evolving  to
combat  China’s  state-led,  non-market  practices. The  United  States’
toolkit  for  addressing  these  challenges  includes  trade  policy  tools,
such  as  tariffs  on  imports  from  China,  controls  on  the  transfer  of
technology,  and  restrictions  on  inbound  and  outbound  investment
that  might  advance  China’s  development  of  sensitive  technologies.
At  the  same  time,  there  remains  a  lack  of  consensus  on  the  scope
and  implementation  of  these  measures.  Lacking  an  overarching  set
of objectives and a comprehensive strategy for achieving them, some
policies  are  implemented  at  cross-purposes,  weakening  the  United
States’  approach  to  economic  competition  with  China.  Unlike  the
National  Security  Strategy  (NSS),  the  United  States  does  not  yet
have a unified strategy organizing its approach to economic security.
The  effectiveness  of  the  United  States’  economic  security  strategy
faces  further  limits  at  present  from  a  lack  of  data  and  analytic  ca-
pabilities  as  well  as  a  lack  of  adequate  alignment  of  policies  with
key allies and partners.

Key Findings

 • U.S.  trade  policy  is  a  key  tool  for  defending  against  China’s
non-market economic practices, diversifying U.S. supply chains,
and preserving U.S. economic security.

 • Efforts  to  de-risk  supply  chains  are  undermined  by  a  lack  of  a
cohesive  trade  policy  as  well  as  the  continued  presence  of  Chi-
nese value-added content in non-Chinese imports.

 • As  China  increasingly  asserts  itself  as  a  significant  military
power,  export  controls  have  emerged  as  a  central  tool  in  U.S.
efforts  to  deny  China  direct  access  to  critical  dual-use  goods
and  advancements  in  national  security-sensitive  technologies.
However,  a  number  of  operational  challenges  diminish  their
effectiveness,  including  lack  of  coordination  among  key  allies,
compliance challenges, and uneven enforcement.

 • While  Congress  in  2018  strengthened  the  U.S.  inbound  invest-
ment screening mechanism, it considered but did not implement
matching rules on outbound investments. In the last few years,

(403)

404

policymakers  have  actively  explored  creating  an  outbound  in-
vestment screening mechanism. Such a mechanism would curb
important  U.S.  economic  support  to  China’s  advanced  technol-
ogy  ambitions,  such  as  the  transfer  of  management  expertise,
know-how, and capital that is unaddressed by the United States’
existing toolkit, including a yet-to-be-implemented executive or-
der (EO).

 • A  lack  of  adequate  detailed  data  on  U.S.  trade  and  investment
flows  poses  an  acute  challenge  to  effective  policy  scoping  and
implementation.

 • Economic  partners  in  the  G7  and  other  developed  markets
have  implemented  trade  measures  to  address  trade  distortions
caused  by  China’s  state-led  economy;  these  measures  continue
to  evolve.  They  are  also  exploring  parallel  export  controls  and
outbound  investment  screening  policies  to  limit  the  flow  of  key
technologies. At  times,  the  United  States  has  had  difficulty  ob-
taining alignment with allies, which can undercut the effective-
ness of U.S. policy and put U.S. companies at a disadvantage.

Recommendations
The Commission recommends:

 • Congress  consider  legislation  to  eliminate  federal  tax  expendi-
tures  for  investments  in  Chinese  companies  on  the  Entity  List
maintained  by  the  U.S.  Department  of  Commerce,  or  identified
as  a  Chinese  military  company  on  either  the  “Non-Specially
Designated  National  (SDN)  Chinese  Military-Industrial  Com-
plex Companies List” maintained by the U.S. Department of the
Treasury  or  the  “Chinese  military  companies”  list  maintained
by the U.S. Department of Defense. Among the tax expenditures
that would be eliminated prospectively are the preferential cap-
ital gains tax rate, the capital loss carry-forward provisions, and
the treatment of carried interest.

 • To enhance the effectiveness of export controls, Congress should:
 ○ Improve the analytic and enforcement capabilities of the U.S.
Department  of  Commerce’s  Bureau  of  Industry  and  Security
(BIS) by providing resources necessary to hire more in-house
experts;  establish  a  Secretary’s  Fellows  Program  to  more  ef-
fectively attract interagency talent; expand partnerships with
the  national  labs;  increase  access  to  data  and  data  analysis
tools,  including  the  acquisition  of  proprietary  datasets  and
modern data analytic systems; and hire additional agents and
analysts for the Office of Export Enforcement.

 ○ Amend the Export Control Reform Act to require that within
30  days  of  granting  a  license  for  export  to  entities  on  the
Entity List, including under the Foreign Direct Product Rule,
BIS  shall  provide  all  relevant  information  about  the  license
approval to the relevant congressional committees, subject to
restrictions on further disclosure under 50 U.S.C. § 4820(h)(2)
(B)(ii).

 ○ Direct the president to:

405

  Designate  a  senior  official  to  coordinate  efforts  across  the
Administration to prioritize bilateral and multilateral sup-
port for U.S. export control initiatives; and

  Establish a Joint Interagency Task Force, reporting to and
overseen by the national security advisor and with its own
budget and staff, to assess ways to achieve the goal of lim-
iting  China’s  access  to  and  development  of  advanced  tech-
nologies  that  pose  a  national  security  risk  to  the  United
States.  The  task  force  should  include  designees  from  the
U.S.  Departments  of  Commerce,  Defense,  State,  Treasury,
and Energy; the intelligence community; and other relevant
agencies.  It  should  assess  the  effectiveness  of  existing  ex-
port controls; provide advice on designing new controls and/
or  using  other  tools  to  maximize  their  effect  while  mini-
mizing their negative impact on U.S. and allied economies;
and  recommend  new  authorities,  institutions,  or  interna-
tional  arrangements  in  light  of  the  long-term  importance
of U.S.-China technology competition.

 ○ Codify  the  “Securing  the  Information  and  Communications
Technology  and  Services  Supply  Chain”  Executive  Order  to
ensure that as the authority is used more robustly, challenges
to  its  status  as  an  executive  order  will  not  constrain  BIS’s
implementation decisions or delay implementation.

 • Congress  direct  the  Administration  to  create  an  Outbound  In-
vestment  Office  within  the  executive  branch  to  oversee  invest-
ments  into  countries  of  concern,  including  China.  The  office
should  have  a  dedicated  staff  and  appropriated  resources  and
be tasked with:
 ○ Prohibiting outbound U.S. investment through a sector-based
approach  in  technologies  the  United  States  has  identified  as
a threat to its national or economic security;

 ○ Expanding the list of covered sectors with the goal of aligning
outbound investment restrictions with export controls. The of-
fice should identify and refine the list of covered technologies
in coordination with appropriate agencies as new innovations
emerge; and

 ○ Developing a broader mandatory notification program for sec-
tors where investment is not prohibited to allow policymakers
to accumulate visibility needed to identify potential high-risk
investments  and  other  sectors  that  pose  a  threat  to  U.S.  na-
tional or economic security. In addition to direct investments,
the  notification  regime  should  capture  passive  investment
flows to help inform debates around the expansion of prohibi-
tions to cover portfolio investment.

 • Congress repeal Permanent Normal Trade Relations (PNTR) for
China. The PNTR status allows China to benefit from the same
trade terms as U.S. allies, despite engaging in practices such as
intellectual property theft and market manipulation. Repealing
PNTR  could  reintroduce  annual  reviews  of  China’s  trade  prac-
tices,  giving  the  United  States  more  leverage  to  address  unfair
trade  behaviors. This  move  would  signal  a  shift  toward  a  more

406

assertive  trade  policy  aimed  at  protecting  U.S.  industries  and
workers from economic coercion.

 • Congress  direct  relevant  departments  and  agencies  to  expand
their  data  collection  and  transparency  initiatives  into  the  vol-
ume  and  types  of  investment  flowing  into  China  by  taking  the
following actions:
 ○ Amending  the  International  Investment  and  Trade  in  Ser-
vices  Survey  Act  to  require  the  Bureau  of  Economic  Analy-
sis within the U.S. Department of Commerce to publish more
detailed  sectoral  breakdowns  of  U.S.  direct  investment  in
China  on  a  nationality  basis  and  the  U.S.  Department  of  the
Treasury to publish annual sector breakdowns of U.S. portfo-
lio  investment  in  China  on  a  nationality  basis.  The  portfolio
investment sectors should be more specific than those provid-
ed  by  the  Commerce  Department  for  direct  investment.  Ad-
ditionally, Congress should require the Treasury Department
to publish quarterly updates—without sector breakdowns—of
nationality-based portfolio investment in China.

 ○ Requiring  the  U.S.  Department  of  Commerce  to  produce  a
report  on  the  feasibility  and  methodology  for  publishing  na-
tionality-based  results  for  direct  investment,  where  offshore
tax  havens  and  locales  of  incorporation  would  not  be  said  to
receive  hundreds  of  billions  of  dollars  and  true  destinations
of the capital would be accurately identified.

 • Congress  direct  the  Administration  to  impose  sanctions  on
Chinese  financial  institutions  that  violate  sanctions,  includ-
ing  those  that  are  proven  to  be  working  with  or  supporting
the Russian military industrial base or facilitating purchases
of  Iranian  oil.

 • In  light  of  the  periodic  and  increasingly  frequent  removal  of
some of these materials from Chinese websites, Congress direct
the  executive  branch  to  fund  the  creation  and  operation  of  a
regularly  updated,  permanent  data  archive,  in  effect  a  series
of  snapshots  of  portions  of  the  Chinese  internet.  In  the  past
decade,  foreign  analysts  have  made  use  of  open  source  Chi-
nese-language  materials  to  gain  insight  into  various  aspects  of
current  policy  as  well  as  internal  (but  unclassified)  discussions
of  future  military,  diplomatic,  and  economic  strategy.  Informa-
tion  would  be  stored  in  the  permanent  data  archive,  accessible
to both government and private analysts.

 • Congress  consider  legislation  to  set  priorities  and  goals  for
U.S.-China economic relations. These policy priorities and goals
should include:
 ○ Updating  existing  trade  and  economic  tools  to  ensure  their
timely  application,  utility,  and  effectiveness  in  countering
China’s non-market economic policies;

 ○ Limiting  U.S.  economic  and  security  dependence  on  supply
chains  in  critical  and  emerging  products,  technologies,  and
services  provided  by  companies  controlled,  operating  in,  or
subject to the influence of China;

407

 ○ Enhancing the accountability of the executive branch to Con-
gress and increasing the transparency of its actions to ensure
coordinated  governmental  action  and  respect  for  Congress’s
constitutional Article I, Section 8 authority;

 ○ Prioritizing  domestic  production  and  employment  while  also
recognizing  the  need,  as  appropriate,  to  coordinate  and  align
policies with friends and allies;

 ○ Acting  to  address  production  overcapacity  fueled  by  Chinese

policies and actions; and

 ○ Advancing the resilience of the U.S. economy and ensuring its

access to key inputs and technologies.

 • Congress  pass  legislation  eliminating  the  ability  of  entities  op-
erating  in  U.S.  Foreign-Trade  Zones  (FTZs)  to  qualify  for  zero
or lower tariffs on products imported from China or Chinese-af-
filiated or -invested entities into the FTZ and then reexported.

 • The  relevant  committees  of  Congress  hold  hearings  to  assess
the  desirability  and  feasibility  of  creating  a  trade  defense  coa-
lition with other like-minded countries to forestall the risk of a
second  China  shock.  Such  a  grouping  would  seek  to  align  poli-
cies for responding to the recent acceleration in China’s exports
of subsidized, underpriced materials and manufactured goods.

Introduction

In recent years, U.S. policymakers have begun to rethink many of
the  assumptions  that  undergirded  the  previous  several  decades  of
trade and economic engagement with China. While China undertook
some  measures  to  reform  its  economy  in  ways  to  promote  private
enterprise and foreign investment, such measures invariably proved
secondary  to  the  Chinese  Communist  Party’s  (CCP)  core  goals  of
remaining  in  power,  strengthening  its  economy  and  military  power
and  growing  China’s  global  influence.  The  CCP  never  intended  to
cede control of China’s economy to market forces.

Early  indications  suggest  that  attempts  by  the  United  States  to
limit  China’s  access  to  and  development  of  certain  dual-use  and
foundational technologies, promote de-risking, and address econom-
ic distortions and unfair trade practices from China have had some
success.  But  even  as  a  growing  array  of  policy  tools  are  being  de-
ployed  to  evolve  U.S.  economic,  trade,  and  related  national  security
policy  toward  China,  the  U.S.  economy  remains  deeply  intertwined
with  China’s.  There  is  a  need  for  a  more  comprehensive  policy  re-
alignment—including  a  review  of  trade  tools,  export  controls,  and
investment  restrictions—as  well  as  a  significantly  greater  effort  to
align these measures with those of allies and like-minded countries
in order to ensure their efficacy.

This chapter begins with a review of how China continues to pur-
sue  its  economic  interests  in  ways  inconsistent  with  global  norms
of  fair  trade. The  chapter  then  reviews  the  United  States’  response
to  China’s  action  across  three  arenas:  trade  policy,  export  controls,
and  investment  screening. The  chapter  draws  on  the  Commission’s
May  2024  hearing  on  “Key  Economic  Strategies  for  Leveling  the

408

U.S.-China  Playing  Field:  Trade,  Investment,  and  Technology,”  con-
sultations with experts, and open source research and analysis.

Economic  Security  as  a  Whole-of-Government

Approach

Over  the  past  three  decades,  U.S.  economic  policy  toward  China
was  substantially  developed  and  implemented  in  functional  silos.
The United States tailored policy approaches based on explicit con-
cerns—such  as  specific  market  access  challenges,  intellectual  prop-
erty (IP) theft, or steel and aluminum overcapacity—so as not to de-
rail broader economic cooperation or to slow what was widely hoped
to be a process of liberalization by China.1

Given  this,  U.S.  strategy  and  implementation  of  its  key  econom-
ic  tools  were  also  siloed.  U.S.  officials  were  aware  that  China’s
non-market economic practices frequently advantaged Chinese com-
panies  at  the  expense  of  U.S.  firms  and  workers  and  resulted  in
significant  shifts  in  supply  chains.  However,  optimism  that  a  com-
plex  and  interdependent  global  economy  would  deter  conflict  and
liberalize  China  tempered  the  U.S.  response  and  kept  the  focus  on
more narrow industry-specific issues or better enforcement of exist-
ing trade rules.2 Similarly, despite periodic concerns that technology
transfers might be assisting the People’s Liberation Army’s military
modernization drive, until very recently this was viewed as an issue
for  narrow  export  controls  on  weapons  and  dual-use  products,  not
a reason to broadly challenge China’s innovation ecosystem or limit
flows  of  U.S.  capital  and  know-how  that  helped  build  up  China’s
technological capabilities in critical and emerging technologies.3

Many policymakers have come to believe that the size, scale, and
complexity  of  China’s  challenge  to  U.S.  interests  requires  more  in-
tense  coordination  between  economic  and  national  security  goals.4
The  United  States,  however,  has  not  reshaped  its  architecture  of
economic  tools  accordingly  despite  a  consensus  that  China  is  now
a  whole-of-government  problem.5 While  the  United  States  has  pur-
sued  numerous  actions  to  refine  and  improve  the  tools  it  uses  to
address  the  trade,  technology,  and  investment  challenges  it  faces
from China, its actions remain fundamentally siloed.

U.S.  export  controls  on  advanced  chips  illustrate  the  risks  of  the
current approach. The U.S. government restricts advanced semicon-
ductor  technologies  aimed  to  limit  China’s  military  modernization.
Whatever  their  impact  on  China’s  ability  to  achieve  progress  on
artificial  intelligence  (AI)  and  supercomputing,  U.S.  export  controls
have  evidently  pushed  Chinese  chip  makers  to  focus  additional  ef-
forts  on  legacy  chip  production.6  However,  trailing-edge—or  lega-
cy—chips are also critical to U.S. and allied commercial and military
supply chains.7 Chinese dominance of the sector is thus incongruent
with  U.S.  strategic  goals.8  Expanding  export  controls  would  likely
be ineffective for this problem. China has secure access to the tech-
nology  necessary  for  legacy  production  and  already  accounts  for  30
percent  of  worldwide  manufacturing  capacity.9  Instead,  other  tools
will  be  needed  to  address  the  United  States’  strategic  objectives  of
maintaining  an  edge  in  the  most  advanced  semiconductors  while
avoiding excessive dependence on China for legacy chips.10

The  United  States  publishes  a  comprehensive  National  Security
Strategy  (NSS)  that  helps  provide  guiding  principles  and  goals,  co-
herence,  and  coordination  across  disparate  government  efforts  for
myriad U.S. national security policies.11 The NSS also helps provide
important messaging and coordination with key allies and partners.
The  most  recent  NSS  repeatedly  mentioned  economic  issues  vis-
à-vis  U.S.  competition  with  and  the  national  security  threat  from
China. These  issues  span  China’s  non-market  abuses  and  economic
coercion,  China’s  partially  closed  economy  and  growing  technolog-
ical  capabilities,  and  China’s  global  economic  importance  and  the
benefits  it  reaps  from  the  open  international  economic  order.12  Yet
even  with  this  recognition  of  China-related  challenges,  there  is  no
comparable  strategy  on  the  economic  side  that  defines  a  clear  set
of  principles  and  goals  to  guide  restructuring  of  the  United  States’
economic  relationship  with  China,  foster  coordination  across  varied
departments  and  policy  tools,  and  drive  development  of  the  tools
that will be needed.

Deploying Tariffs and Other Trade Measures
Emerging  Consensus  on  Trade  Policy  Objectives  toward

China

Key priorities of U.S. trade policy since 1945, according to the Con-
gressional  Research  Service,  have  included  “(1)  fostering  economic
growth  and  securing  more  open,  equitable,  and  reciprocal  market
access for U.S. exports and investment; (2) protecting U.S. producers
from unfair foreign trade practices and rapid surges in fairly traded
imports;  and  (3)  strengthening  the  rules-based  multilateral  trading
system  to  help  achieve  the  above  objectives  and  further  U.S.  for-
eign policy.” 13 Since 2017, however, the focus of U.S. trade policy has
shifted  in  significant  ways  as  the  United  States  pivoted  to  address
what it saw as rising economic challenges and flaws in the previous
policy  framework,  particularly  vis-à-vis  China.14 The  United  States
has  increasingly  deployed  its  trade  policy  instruments  to  address
three areas in the U.S.-China economic relationship:

 • China’s  harmful  economic  practices:  Since  China  joined  the
WTO, the United States has largely sought to address the costs
to the U.S. economy from China’s non-market practices through
bilateral  engagement  and  multilateral  mechanisms.  Beijing’s
harmful  policies  include  unfair  subsidies,  access  to  free  or  sub-
sidized credit, and other non-trade barriers; coercive IP transfer
and  theft;  and  protectionism  and  market  access  restrictions.15
Distortions in China’s system have often led to significant over-
capacity,  which,  when  combined  with  the  open  international
trading  system,  has  enabled  China’s  export-led  growth  model
and  injured  market-based  producers  in  other  countries.16  In
2018,  Section  301  tariffs  were  unilaterally  imposed  to  make
progress  on  these  issues.  This  marked  a  shift  from  a  previous
approach based on bilateral and multilateral frameworks.17
 • Supply chain resilience: In response to growing geopolitical ten-
sions and, later, shocks related to the COVID-19 pandemic, the
United States has intensified its efforts to address supply chain
risks  and  reduce  reliance  on  Chinese  production. As  economist

410

Emily  Blanchard  observes,  governments  are  no  longer  just  in-
terested  in  what  goods  and  services  enter  or  are  sold  within
their borders but also are looking to reshape patterns of produc-
tion  occurring  outside  their  borders  and  even  before  domestic
firms may be involved, an approach that was not deeply consid-
ered when the WTO framework was established.18

 • The  intersection  of  economic  and  national  security:  In  recent
years, U.S. trade policy has aimed to address the United States’
persistent and massive trade deficit with China, the loss of U.S.
jobs and industry, and potential national security concerns aris-
ing from trade-related harm to domestic industries such as steel
and  aluminum.19  Ongoing  policy  debates  center  on  how  to  de-
ploy  trade  measures  to  ensure  the  United  States  does  not  lose
critical industries to low-cost, state-supported, and non-market-
based competition from China.

Recent U.S. Trade Measures

Since 2017, the United States has promulgated a complex web of
trade  measures  to  mitigate  harms  from  Chinese  imports  in  an  at-
tempt to create a more level playing field. Authorities under Section
301  of  the Trade Act  of  1974  were  used  to  undertake  an  expansion
in tariffs that was unprecedented in recent history. Alongside these
actions,  the  United  States  also  turned  to  Section  201  of  the  Trade
Act  of  1974  and  Section  232  of  the Trade  Expansion Act  to  protect
domestic  industry,  including  from  harmful  Chinese  economic  prac-
tices. At the same time, U.S. industry expanded use of quasi-judicial
trade remedy tools such as antidumping investigations, which were
the source of most pre-2017 additional tariffs on imports from China
following its accession to the WTO.20 By the end of 2020, the United
States’ trade-weighted average tariff on Chinese products (including
antidumping  duties)  was  26.7  percent,  compared  to  8.4  percent  at
the start of 2018.* 21

Section 201 Action on Washing Machines and Solar Panels

On February 7, 2018, the United States placed duties on imports
of washing machines and solar cells and modules under Section 201
of  the Trade Act  of  1974,  the  first  imposition  of  Section  201  tariffs
since  2001.22  According  to  economic  historian  Douglas  Irwin,  Sec-
tion 201 was meant to be “the principal means by which industries
harmed by imports could receive temporary relief from foreign com-
petition.” 23 If the U.S. International Trade Commission (USITC) de-
termines  following  an  investigation  that  a  product’s  import  volume
is  a  “substantial  cause  of  serious  injury,  or  the  threat  thereof,  to
the domestic industry,” the U.S. president can then decide to impose
trade  restrictions.24  Relief  under  Section  201  is  meant  to  serve  as
a  temporary  “global”  safeguard,  meaning  import  restrictions  for  a
particular product or industry are applied to imports from all coun-

* The  antidumping  and  countervailing  duties  (AD/CVD)  assessed  by  the  United  States  tended
to  be  substantially  higher  than  tariffs  under  Section  301. The  average  tariff  without  accounting
for these trade remedies rose from 3.1 percent in January 2018 to 19.3 percent in December 2020,
reflecting that Section 301 and other trade authorities were the primary drivers of the increase.

national Economics, April 6, 2023.

tries.* 25 Although  these  safeguard  duties  enable  the  United  States
to  deal  with  temporary  import  surges  in  a  way  that  is  compliant
with the WTO’s safeguard provisions, the authority has seen limited
use. This is partially because the standard of “substantial cause” has
proven difficult to establish, while its requirement of “serious injury”
entails  a  much  more  onerous  burden  of  proof  than  the  equivalent
standard  in  antidumping  and  countervailing  duties  (AD/CVD)  pro-
ceedings.26

After the USITC concluded two investigations on imports of wash-
ing machines and solar products, the U.S. government placed tariffs
of  up  to  50  percent  on  residential  washers  and  initial  tariffs  of  30
percent  on  certain  solar  cells  and  modules.† 27  Though  the  Section
201  duties  on  residential  washers  ended  in  February  2023,‡  the
measures  on  solar  products  were  renewed  in  February  2022  to  last
until 2026 (see textbox below).28

Overlapping Trade Measures in the Solar Industry
The  numerous  trade  measures  covering  solar  cells  and  mod-
ules  illustrates  the  wide-ranging  playbook  the  United  States  is
employing  to  counter  unfair  Chinese  trade  practices.  Christian
Roseland, an analyst at Clean Energy Associates, identifies seven
separate  U.S.  trade  actions  (including  repeated  use  of  AD/CVD
statutes)  covering  solar  products  that  remain  in  effect.29  These
measures include:

 • AD/CVD orders: The United States now enforces three sepa-
rate AD/CVD orders related to Chinese solar production, and
an  additional  investigation  was  launched  in  2024.  In  2012,
the U.S. Department  of Commerce placed AD/CVD  on all  so-
lar  cells  from  China.30  In  2015,  the  Commerce  Department
issued  a  new  AD/CVD  order  covering  solar  modules  assem-
bled  in  China,  regardless  of  where  the  solar  cells  originat-
ed,  and  it  also  placed  an  antidumping  order  on  Taiwan  in
response  to  Chinese  companies  establishing  manufacturing
facilities on the island.31 In 2022, the Commerce Department
found  that  Chinese  companies  were  routing  covered  solar
products  through  Cambodia,  Malaysia,  Thailand,  and  Viet-
nam  to  circumvent  the  AD/CVD  order,  although  additional
duties on these imports were waived until June 2024.32 Most
recently,  in  May  2024,  the  Commerce  Department  initiated,
at  the  request  of  petitioners,  a  new  AD/CVD  case  aimed  at
imports from various Southeast Asian countries that are not
otherwise  subject  to  the  circumvention  finding.33  The  inves-

* As  a  result,  Section  201  duties  generally  cannot  be  evaded  through  transshipment,  an  illicit
activity that undermines other trade authorities like AD/CVD orders, which target imports on a
country-specific basis. Specific countries are sometimes exempted from Section 201 duties.

† As temporary measures, both tariffs were scheduled to be gradually phased out over a number
of  years.  In  addition,  the  Administration  used  tariff-rate  quotas,  which  allow  a  limited  number
of goods to enter at a lower tariff rate. U.S. Trade Representative, Fact Sheet: Section 201 Cases:
Imported Large Residential Washing Machines and Imported Solar Cells and Modules.

‡ In its statutorily required evaluation of the Section 201 washing machine duties, the USITC
assessed that the duties led to a decline in imports of residential washers and an increase in U.S.
industry’s  market  share  and  financial  performance  between  2018  and  2022,  with  LG  Electron-
ics  USA,  Inc.  and  Samsung  Electronic  Home Appliance America,  LLC  emerging  as  the  primary
beneficiaries. U.S. International Trade Commission, Large Residential Washers: Evaluation of the

tigation includes alleged instances of transnational subsidies
provided  by  Chinese  policy  banks.34  Prior  to  2024,  the  Unit-
ed  States  did  not  countervail  subsidies  provided  by  a  gov-
ernment  to  firms  operating  in  another  country.35  (For  more
on  the  Commerce  Department’s  changing  approach  to  trans-
national  subsidies,  see  Chapter  4,  “Unsafe  and  Unregulated
Chinese  Consumer  Goods:  Challenges  in  Enforcing  Import
Regulations and Laws.”)

 • Safeguard duties: In January 2018, the United States placed
a tariff-rate quota on imports of solar cells and modules from
all  countries—though  China  was  among  the  largest  sourc-
es  of  covered  products—for  an  initial  period  of  four  years,
which  was  extended  for  another  four-year  period  in  2022.36
Between  2019  and  2024,  bifacial  (i.e.,  two-sided)  solar  cells,
a  product  predominantly  used  in  large-scale  utility  projects,
were granted an exclusion from the safeguard action; the U.S.
government  terminated  the  moratorium  in  May  2024  after
imports of the product continued to surge.* 37

 • Section 301: Solar cells and modules were included in the du-
ties  imposed  after  the  Section  301  investigation  into  China’s
technology transfer, IP, and innovation policies. In May 2024,
the U.S. government announced that it would double the tar-
iffs on certain solar products from 25 percent to 50 percent as
part  of  the  Office  of  the  U.S. Trade  Representative’s  (USTR)
four-year review of the Section 301 action.38

 • Uyghur  Forced  Labor  Prevention  Act  (UFLPA):  The  UFLPA
creates  a  rebuttable  presumption  that  goods  produced  in
Xinjiang  are  made  using  forced  labor  and  therefore  barred
from  importation.39 The  United  States  has  used  the  UFLPA
to  seize  over  a  thousand  shipments  of  solar  products,  pre-
sumably  because  they  use  polysilicon  originating  from  the
region.40

In total, imports subject to these trade measures face an effec-
tive tariff between 91 percent and 286 percent.41 Other products,
such  as  steel,  aluminum,  and  semiconductors,  are  also  subject  to
duties under multiple authorities.† 42

* The Trump Administration also attempted to revoke the exclusion at the end of 2020, one year
after introducing it. However, the U.S. Court of International Trade ruled in 2021 that revocation
fell outside of the president’s authority and reinstated the exclusion. President Joe Biden elected
to  maintain  the  exclusion  in  2022  when  extending  the  safeguard  measures.  In  2023,  a  federal
appeals  court  overturned  the  Court  of  International  Trade’s  finding,  ruling  that  the  president
does  have  authority  to  terminate  exclusions  from  the  tariff.  Jennifer A.  Dlouhy, “Biden  Seeks  to
Bolster Solar Manufacturers with Tax and Trade Moves,” Bloomberg, May 16, 2024.

† These overlapping measures, however, create a complex regulatory environment, and industry
representatives  have  asserted  that  uncertainty  about  future  duties  undermines  efforts  to  create
resilient  supply  chains.  Clean  Energy  Associates  and  American  Council  on  Renewable  Energy,

Section 232

Another  trade  policy  tool  the  United  States  has  deployed  is  Sec-
tion  232  of  the  1962  Trade  Expansion  Act,  which  authorizes  ac-
tions  when  the  quantity  or  circumstances  of  specific  imports  pose
a  threat  to  U.S.  national  security.* 43  Between  2001  and  2017,  no
Section 232 investigations were conducted.† 44 Since 2017, however,
nine  new  investigations  have  been  initiated  into  imports  of  steel,
aluminum, automobiles and automobile parts, and other metals and
components.45  In  seven  of  these  cases,  the  Commerce  Department
determined that subject imports posed national security threats, but
because Section 232 remedies are viewed as extraordinary, only two
of  these  investigations  led  to  tariff  actions.46  The  steel  and  alumi-
num Section 232 investigations resulted in import tariffs of 25 per-
cent and 10 percent, respectively.‡ 47

Section 301

To  date,  Section  301  of  the Trade Act  of  1974  has  been  the  most
versatile  and  significant  tool  for  responding  to  China’s  non-market
policies.  Section  301  of  the  Trade  Act  of  1974  provides  the  USTR
broad  discretion  to  suspend  trade  agreement  concessions  or  impose
import  restrictions  if  a  U.S.  trading  partner  is  found  violating  com-
mitments or engaging in an act, practice, or policy that is “unreason-
able  or  discriminatory  and  burdens  or  restricts  [U.S.]  commerce.” 48
Prior  to  2017,  Section  301  had  largely  fallen  out  of  use  as  a  trade
remedy  tool,  with  119  investigations  having  occurred  from  1975  to
2000  and  only  five  between  2000  and  2016.§ 49  The  USTR  initiat-
ed  a  broad  Section  301  investigation  in  August  2017  into  China’s
technology  transfer,  IP,  and  innovation  policies.  That  investigation
ultimately became the basis for the United States to impose signif-
icant  tariffs  on  two-thirds  of  all  imports  from  China  in  four  waves
of  tariff  actions  between  July  2018  and  September  2019,  impact-
ing  $335  billion  in  trade ¶  with  duties  ranging  between  7.5  percent

* Although a wide variety of actors may trigger the initiation of a Section 232 investigation—in-
cluding any “interested party,” the head of “any department or agency,” and the secretary of com-
merce—investigations have historically been rare. Brock Williams of the Congressional Research
Service  notes  that  prior  to  the  2017  investigations  under  the  Trump  Administration,  Section
232 action was last taken in 1986, with a total of just 26 investigations and six actual trade en-
forcement action occurring before 2017. Brock R. Williams, “Trump Administration Tariff Actions:
Frequently Asked Questions,” Congressional Research Service CRS R 45249, May 18, 2021, 5.

† The  use  of  Section  232  gives  the  Commerce  Department  and  the  president  broad  authority
to  examine  imports  that  may  threaten  national  security  but  otherwise  would  not  be  prohibited
under  the  terms  of  existing  trade  agreements  or  the  WTO.  The  majority  of  the  Section  232  in-
vestigations took place during the height of the Cold War in response to increased threats facing
U.S.  national  security.  Doug  Palmer, “The  Cold War  Origins  of Trump’s  Favorite Trade Weapon,”
Politico, July 5, 2018.

‡ The tariffs were not just aimed at China; initially they were imposed on most steel and alumi-
num imports into the United States. Various countries, including the EU, Japan, and the United
Kingdom,  later  negotiated  tariff  suspensions  on  set  volumes  of  imports.  China  along  with  other
trading  partners  raised  a WTO  case  against  the  Section  232  tariffs  in  2018. The  initial  findings
of  the  panel  concurred  that  the  Section  232  tariffs  went  beyond  the  scope  of  allowed  national
security measures under the WTO, and the United States has appealed the case, effectively stop-
ping  further  developments  in  the  decision-making  progress. Alan  H.  Price  et  al., “United  States

§ Among  the  five  Section  301  investigations,  in  2010  the  Obama  Administration  launched  an
investigation into China’s policies affecting green technologies, following industry petition. Office

¶ These  figures  are  relative  to  2017  levels,  and  the  targeted  products  amounted  to  66  percent
of  all  imports  from  China. The  United  States  announced  plans  to  implement  tariffs  on  another

414

and  25  percent.* 50  Between  July  2018  and  May  2024,  the  United
States assessed $215 billion in duties under the Section 301 action,
or roughly $36 billion per year.51 For comparison, U.S. Customs and
Border Protection collected $35 billion in duties across all countries
and  trade  authorities  in  fiscal  year  (FY)  2017.52  According  to  Ja-
mieson  Greer,  a  partner  in  the  International  Trade  team  at  King
&  Spalding,  these  tariffs  were  a  key  piece  of  a  new  approach  and
enforcement  posture  toward  China  that  aimed  to “level  the  playing
field  and  potentially  create  an  environment  where  negotiations  for
improved terms of trade were possible.” 53

In  May  2024,  the  United  States  modified  the  Section  301  tariffs
to  respond  to  emerging  sources  of  Chinese  overcapacity.  Following
the  completion  of  a  review  of  the  2018–2019  tariffs,  the  USTR  de-
termined  to  continue  the  Section  301  duties  already  in  place  while
announcing new tariffs on products that “are targeted by China for
dominance  or  are  sectors  where  the  U.S.  has  recently  made  signif-
icant  investments.” 54  These  tariffs  notably  included  a  100  percent
tariff  on  made-in-China  electric  vehicles  (EVs),  effectively  doubling
the  cost  of  importing  an  EV  from  China.† 55  The  EV  duties  are
intended  to  align  with  ongoing  U.S.  efforts  to  boost  domestic  EV
production  and  promote  EV  production  jobs  in  the  United  States,
which  could  otherwise  be  uncompetitive  with  low-cost  vehicles  sold
by BYD and other Chinese EV automakers that have benefited from
years  of  heavy  subsidies.56  Additional  tariffs  were  also  placed  on
imports of Chinese EV batteries, personal protective equipment, cer-
tain  critical  minerals,  semiconductors,  and  ship-to-shore  cranes.57
These  actions  placed  tariffs  on  an  additional  $18  billion  in  imports
from  China,  though  many  have  extended  phase-in  periods.58  As  a
reflection of Section 301’s newly elevated role in U.S. trade strategy
toward  China,  the  USTR  is  considering  the  need  for  further  action
under the statute. In April 2024, the USTR launched a new Section
301  investigation  into  China’s  practices  in  the  shipbuilding,  mari-
time, and logistics sectors.‡ 59

The “Phase One” Trade Deal

The  Section  301  tariffs  became  the  basis  for  broad  negotiations
with China over a variety of trade issues. In January 2020, these ne-
gotiations culminated in a trade agreement with China, often called
the  “Phase  One”  Economic  and  Trade  Deal,  wherein  China  agreed
to address key U.S. concerns in exchange for a reduction in Section
301  tariffs.§ 60  China  agreed  to  enhance  IP  protections,  terminate

roughly $151 billion in goods in December 2019, but it suspended this action because of ongoing
trade negotiations with Beijing. Chad P. Bown, “The U.S. China Trade War and Phase One Agree-
ment,” Peterson Institute for International Economics, February 2021, 13, 28.

* The list of Section 301 tariffs issued in September 2019 applied an initial duty of 10 percent

trade agreement. Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, United States and China Reach Phase
One Trade Agreement, December 13, 2019.

policy  support  caused  Chinese  shipbuilders  to  increase  their  global  market  share  by  40  percent.

policies  that  force  technology  transfer  from  U.S.  companies,  and
increase  purchases  of  certain  U.S.  products  by  specified  amounts,
among other commitments.

While the COVID-19 pandemic created global disruptions that re-
sulted in a significant change to economic conditions, China fell far
short of fulfilling its commitment to purchase an additional $200 bil-
lion worth of U.S. products over 2017 levels before the end of 2021.
According  to  calculations  by  economist  Chad  Bown,*  China’s  pur-
chases  of  covered  products  reached  only  58  percent  of  its  purchase
commitments by the end of 2021.61 Even aside from the purchasing
commitments, however, the USTR assessed that China has failed to
meet  many  of  its  Phase  One  obligations.  Though  China’s  2020  im-
plementation of the Foreign Investment Law and 2021 amendments
to  the  Copyright  Law,  Patent  Law,  and  Criminal  Law  partially  met
or fulfilled some of the elements of the Phase One deal, many tech-
nology  transfer-related  policies  continue.  In  its  Statutory  Four-Year
Review  of  the  Section  301  measures,  the  USTR  stated,  “Instead  of
pursuing fundamental reform, the Chinese government largely took
superficial  measures  aimed  at  addressing  negative  perceptions  of
its  technology  transfer-related  acts,  policies,  and  practices.  At  the
same  time,  China  has  persisted  and  even  become  more  aggressive,
particularly through cyber intrusions and cybertheft, in its attempts
to acquire and absorb foreign technology.” 62

Effects and Consequences of U.S. Trade Action on China

U.S. trade policy since 2017 has had wide-ranging impacts on the
U.S. economy and promoted specified trade objectives to varying de-
grees.  In  its  statutory  review  of  the  China  Section  301  tariff  action
in  2024,  the  USTR  assesses  that  the  Section  301  tariffs  were  “ef-
fective  in  encouraging  China  to  take  steps  toward  eliminating  the
investigated technology transfer-related acts, policies, and practices,
and in counteracting such policies. The Section 301 tariffs have also
been  effective  in  reducing  the  exposure  of  U.S.  persons  and  compa-
nies  to  China’s  technology  transfer-related  acts,  policies,  and  prac-
tices.” 63  Following  the  tariffs,  China’s  share  of  total  U.S.  imports
declined  steadily,  falling  from  20  percent  in  2017  to  13.1  percent
in the first eight months of 2024.† 64 Across sectors covered by Sec-
tion 301 tariffs, the USITC estimates that tariffs caused imports to
decline  on  average  by  13  percent  between  2018  and  2021.65  Oth-
er  economies,  including  Mexico  and  Vietnam,  are  emerging  as  key
suppliers of intermediate and final goods for the U.S. economy. (For
more on the emerging signs of supply chain diversification from Chi-
na, see Chapter 1, “U.S.-China Economic and Trade Relations (Year
in Review).”)

There  are  differing  assessments  on  the  employment  and  broader
economic  impact  of  the  tariffs.  The  USTR  notes  that  the  U.S.  tar-

cent,  while  other  products  subject  to  the  China  Section  301  action  kept  a  25  percent  duty.  Chad

iffs  and  Chinese  counter-tariffs “have  had  small  negative  effects  on
U.S. aggregate economic welfare, positive impacts on U.S. production
in  the  10  sectors  most  directly  affected  by  the  tariffs,  and  mini-
mal  impacts  on  economy-wide  prices  and  employment.” * 66  Though
the  tariffs  increased  costs  for  some  U.S.  businesses  and  consumers,
when averaged across the entire U.S. economy, the effect was small †
and  overwhelmed  by  inflationary  pressures  stemming  from  the
COVID-19  pandemic.67  The  USITC  estimated  that  the  tariffs  were
responsible  for  a  0.2  percent  increase  in  the  price  of  covered  prod-
ucts produced domestically between 2018 and 2021, although prices
increased by as much as 15–25 percent in a select number of sectors,
including  textiles,  semiconductors,  and  motor  vehicle  parts.‡ 68 The
USITC’s  modeling  also  found  that  the  Section  301  tariffs  caused
domestic  production  to  expand  by  between  1.2  and  7.5  percent  in
the  ten  sectors  most  directly  affected  by  the  tariffs.69 As  Mr.  Greer
highlighted  in  testimony  before  the  Commission,  total  U.S.  manu-
facturing  employment  grew  by  500,000  workers  between  2016  and
2019.70 Though this increase in employment occurred after years of
stagnant  manufacturing  jobs  growth  prior  to  the  tariffs,  there  are
differing  assessments  on  employment  effect  of  the  tariffs.71  For  in-
stance,  in  the  steel  sector,  the  Economic  Policy  Institute  highlights
how  investments  announced  following  the  Section  232  steel  action
in 2018 directly created 3,200 jobs.72 However, other estimates show
net job losses when accounting for employment in industries down-
stream from the steel sector. Economists Kadee Russ and Lydia Cox
calculate  that  the  March  2018  tariffs  on  steel  and  aluminum  led
to  75,000  fewer  jobs  in  manufacturing  by  mid-2019.73  Nonetheless,
the United States added nearly 250,000 manufacturing jobs in 2018
and  at  the  fastest  growth  rate  since  the  1980s.74  Various  studies
find  that  the  overall  impact  of  the  tariffs  and  China’s  retaliatory
measures was mixed and may have had a small negative impact on
overall  employment  in  2018  and  2019,  although  total  U.S.  employ-
ment  continued  to  grow  during  those  years.75  If  there  was  short-
term  pain,  in  Mr.  Greer’s  assessment,  it  should  be  weighed  against
the  “cost  of  doing  nothing  or  underestimating  the  threat  posed  by
China.” 76

Circumvention  of  U.S.  Tariffs  Likely  Weakened  Their

Effectiveness

The  success  of  U.S  trade  policies  against  China  was  at  least  par-
tially  undermined  by  Chinese  exporting  firms  using  various  tac-
tics  to  circumvent  or  evade  the  increased  tariffs.  These  measures
include:  (1)  transshipment  or  re-routing  of  products  through  third
countries  to  avoid  China-specific  duties,  (2)  fraudulently  underval-

* The  USTR  did  not  conduct  its  own  economic  analysis  of  the  tariffs  and  instead  synthesized

‡ The  import  data  used  in  the  USITC’s  models  do  not  account  for  shipments  valued  under

the de minimis exception, their exclusion from USITC’s model could bias their price coefficients,
particularly in industries like textiles where cross-border e-commerce trade has grown rapidly.

uing or mis-invoicing imports to U.S. customs to lower the assessed
duty,  and  (3)  increased  use  of  duty-free  entry  for  small  e-commerce
shipments  under  the  de  minimis  exception.  (For  more  on  the  in-
creased usage of these channels and the resulting problems for U.S.
customs  and  regulatory  officials,  see  Chapter  4,  “Unsafe  and  Un-
regulated  Chinese  Consumer  Goods:  Challenges  in  Enforcing  Im-
port Regulations and Laws.”) The extent of tariff avoidance through
these tactics is unclear due to limited data and enforcement capac-
ity.  However,  in  its  four-year  review  of  the  Section  301  tariffs,  the
USTR acknowledged the challenge posed by customs duty evasion.77
China also took other actions to mitigate some of the impact of trade
tensions on Chinese firms (see textbox below).

China’s Efforts to Offset the Economic Impact of
Trade Actions

China  designed  its  retaliation  against  U.S.  trade  measures  to
maximize impact on the United States while minimizing harm to
Chinese  exporters.  China’s  retaliatory  tariffs  covered  roughly  60
percent of U.S. imports relative to 2017 levels, raising the average
tariff on U.S. goods to 21.1 percent.78 A number of studies provide
evidence  that  China  strategically  targeted  U.S.  products  in  what
it  viewed  to  be  politically  sensitive  areas.* 79  China’s  retaliato-
ry  action  most  notably  included  tariffs  on  nearly  all  U.S.  agri-
culture  products,  but  China  also  raised  duties  on  a  broad  range
of  U.S.  intermediate  inputs  used  by  its  manufacturing  sector.80
By  2020,  Chinese  retaliatory  tariffs  covered  roughly  38  percent
of  U.S.  manufactured  goods  imports,  equivalent  to  $30  billion  in
2017  terms.81  However,  China  refrained  from  placing  tariffs  on
aviation components and semiconductor products and equipment,
suggesting  it  avoided  raising  tariffs  on  key  products  related  to
its own technological development priorities.82 Instead, China ap-
peared  to  target  products  that  had  alternative  suppliers  to  the
United  States,  ensuring  China-based  firms  could  substitute  out
U.S.  inputs  impacted  by  China’s  retaliatory  measures.†  China
also reduced its most-favored-nation tariff across a range of prod-
ucts  from  all  other  countries  shortly  after  the  start  of  the  trade
war,  further  incentivizing  China-based  firms  to  shift  away  from
the  United  States.83  China’s  average  tariff  on  goods  from  other
countries fell from 8 percent to 6.5 percent since 2018.‡ 84

* There  is  some  evidence  that  China’s  retaliatory  tariffs  introduced  in  2018  were  correlated
with Republican candidates losing vote share in the 2018 House elections relative to the results
in 2016. However, the magnitude of this impact varies across different studies based on different
econometric modeling decisions. Emily J. Blanchard, Chad P. Bown, and Davin Chor, “Did Trump’s
Trade War Impact the 2018 Election?” Journal of International Economics 148 (2024): 1–23; Da-
vid  Autor  et  al.,  “Help  for  the  Heartland?  The  Employment  and  Electoral  Effects  of  the  Trump
Tariffs in the United States,” NBER Working Papers, January 2024.

† Economists  Davin  Chor  and  Bingjing  Li  find  that  China’s  imports  of  intermediate  goods
picked up from the rest of the world in the first few months after China imposed retaliatory mea-
sures  on  the  United  States,  suggesting  that  other  economies  filled  in  for  tariffed  U.S.  products.

‡ China’s  most-favored  nation  cuts  substantially  overlapped  with  the  list  of  U.S.  products  sub-
ject  to  Chinese  retaliatory  tariffs,  suggesting  these  reductions  aimed  to  further  incentivize  Chi-
nese  firms  to  switch  away  from  U.S.  suppliers.  Between  January  2018  and  June  2019,  China
reduced  the  most-favored  nation  tariff  for  4,646  product  lines,  nearly  three-quarters  of  which
were covered by China’s retaliatory duties on the United States. Chad P. Bown, Euijin Jung, and

China’s Efforts to Offset the Economic Impact of
Trade Actions—Continued

China implemented other measures to lessen the impact of the
trade tensions on China’s economy. China’s government absorbed
some of the cost of the U.S. tariffs by reducing taxes on domestic
export manufacturers. China decreased the gross value-added tax
(VAT)  rate  from  17  percent  in  2018  to  13  percent  by  the  end  of
2020  while  also  increasing  the  VAT  rebate  on  exports  over  the
same  time  period.85  The  share  of  Chinese  exports  that  faced  an
effective  VAT  rate  of  zero  increased  from  5  percent  in  2017  to
about  50  percent  by  the  end  of  2020.86  China  also  made  it  eas-
ier  for  firms  to  access  its  processing  trade  regime,  under  which
manufacturers  approved  by  Chinese  authorities  can  import  in-
puts duty free, provided they are used to produce exports.87 After
2018, the share of U.S. imports that entered China as processing
trade rose sharply, suggesting that firms made greater use of the
customs arrangement to negate the impact of tariffs; notably, the
processing  trade  share  of  imports  from  other  countries  remained
largely  unchanged.88  Nevertheless,  the  sum  of  China’s  responses
led  to  a  diversion  of  imports  away  from  the  United  States—by
2023,  the  United  States  was  the  source  for  just  6.5  percent  of
China’s total imports, down from 7.3 percent before 2018.89

The existing U.S. tariff architecture is not well-suited to deter the
import  of  products  made  in  other  countries  using  Chinese  compo-
nents,  creating  an  opportunity  for  Chinese  exporters  to  continue
accessing the U.S. market by moving final assembly outside of Chi-
na.  The  Section  301  tariffs  on  China  are  designed  to  duty  imports
directly from China-based producers. However, under the methodol-
ogy  typically  used  to  determine  duty  rates,  the  tariffs  generally  do
not  apply  to  exporters  based  outside  of  China  that  utilize  Chinese
components, provided that the inputs are modified in such a way to
meet  the  customs  standard  for  the  applicable  rule  of  origin  (often
requiring a “substantial transformation”).90 This creates a situation
where the United States may continue to import Chinese value-add-
ed  content  embedded  via  third-country  supply  chain  linkages.  A
number of recent studies note that trade data suggest producers in
third countries, such as Vietnam, relied at least in part on Chinese
inputs  to  ramp  up  their  exports  to  the  United  States  since  2018.91
Chinese  EV  makers  are  reportedly  seeking  to  set  up  production  in
Mexico,  which  could  enable  them  to  use  Mexico-based  operations
as  a  backdoor  to  import  low-cost  vehicles  into  the  U.S.  market  and
avoid  the  100  percent  duties  on  Chinese  EVs  under  Section  301.92
By  statute,  Section  301  duties  apply  only  to  the  trading  partner  in
question  and  do  not  cover  products  produced  in  third  countries.*

Eva (Yiwen) Zhang, “Trump Has Gotten China to Lower Its Tariffs. Just Toward Everyone Else,”
Peterson Institute for International Economics, June 12, 2019.

* Other  U.S.  trade  authorities  enforced  against  China  account  for  this  dynamic.  Section  201
duties  are  assessed  on  imports  regardless  of  country  of  origin,  while  the  Section  232  steel  and
aluminum  duties  were  assessed  on  other  countries  that  processed  unrefined  products  made  in
China  for  the  U.S.  market.  In  the  AD/CVD  context,  the  U.S.  Commerce  Department  can  also
conduct scope and circumvention inquiries to determine and implement remedies if producers in
third countries rely on products subject to an AD/CVD order.

419

Though  Mr.  Greer  acknowledges  that  even  incremental  movements
of  supply  chains  represent  an  improvement  over  the  status  quo,  he
notes that third-country workarounds can be addressed by “extend-
ing  the  effect  of  the  measures  to  imports  from  Chinese  headquar-
tered companies or adjusting the rules of origin for goods subject to
the  Section  301  tariffs.” 93 Tools  to  accomplish  this  include  utilizing
rules of origin requirements in U.S. free trade agreements with oth-
er trading partners.

Challenges  in  Aligning  Tariff  Measures  with  Strategic

Objectives

The  findings  of  the  China  Section  301  investigation  into  China’s
technology  transfer  practices  have  been  used  to  justify  tariffs  on  a
range  of  products  that  extend  well  beyond  the  original  scope  of  the
investigation,  leading  some  to  assess  that  the  trade  measures  lack
strategic clarity. Mr. Greer testified before the Commission that the
China  Section  301  tariffs  were  designed  to  target  products  relat-
ed  to  the  Made  in  China  2025  strategy,  a  national  industry  policy
strategy released in 2015 to promote ten high-tech industries.94 An
analysis  by  Mary  Lovely  and Yang  Liang  at  the  Peterson  Institute
of  International  Economics  compared  the  products  included  in  the
initial Section 301 tariff action—which was implemented on July 6,
2018, and covered $34 billion in Chinese imports—to a list of sectors
identified by the Commerce Department as patent-intensive.95 They
found that 80 percent of the products in the initial tariff action fell
within  these  industries,  consistent  with  the  technologies  the  USTR
identified  as  subject  to  extensive  Chinese  technology  transfer  prac-
tices  in  its  Section  301  investigation.96  However,  subsequent  tariff
waves were scoped much more broadly. According to Dr. Lovely, these
Section 301 actions placed greater focus on less knowledge-intensive
and  more  labor-intensive  sectors.97  Because  of  the  expansive  scope
of  the  measures,  she  assessed  in  testimony  before  the  Commission
that “U.S. trade policy objectives have not been clearly linked to the
trade  policy  instruments  we  currently  deploy.” 98  Some  argue  that
such a broad approach is necessary to respond to the pervasiveness
of  China’s  non-market  practices,  while  others  advocate  for  focusing
U.S.  trade  restrictions  on  a  set  of  products  with  national  security
implications and removing barriers to trade with China in less stra-
tegically important areas.99 Following the USTR’s 2024 Section 301
review,  the  U.S.  government  maintained  and  selectively  reviewed
the  existing  broad-ranging  tariff  measures,  and  it  also  selectively
expanded  the  tariff  measures  to  industries  where  surging  Chinese
manufacturing  capacity  posed  a  clear  threat  to  ongoing  efforts  to
bolster U.S. domestic production.100

The China Section 301 tariffs impacted foreign firms in China and
raised  production  costs  for  U.S.-based  firms  with  Chinese  supply
chains, reflecting the challenge of targeting tariffs solely at Chinese
producers  that  benefit  from  state  support.  In  their  review  of  the
Section 301 tariff list, Dr. Lovely and Dr. Liang found that products
targeted  for  tariffs  were  primarily  sourced  from  foreign  affiliates
operating in China, with the exception of tariffs on China’s chemical
sector (see textbox on “Chinese Supply Chains Are Reducing Depen-
dence on Foreign-Invested Enterprises (FIEs)”).101 In the aggregate,

420

total  U.S.  trade  with  China  only  amounted  to  3.2  percent  of  U.S.
gross domestic product (GDP) in 2018, meaning most U.S. economic
activity  had  limited  reliance  on  China.* 102  The  Section  301  tariffs
did  increase  production  costs  for  U.S.  firms  using  China  as  an  ex-
port  production  platform  or  using  intermediate  inputs  from  China.
Costs for U.S.-based producers that relied on supply chains linked to
China also rose. By 2020, 93 percent of Chinese intermediate goods
imports  were  subject  to  higher  duties,  compared  to  69  percent  of
consumer  goods  and  47  percent  of  capital  equipment.103  One  study
found that for U.S. exporting firms with supply chain links to China,
the tariffs on imported inputs effectively acted as a 2 percent tariff
on their exports.† 104 The USTR engaged in an exclusion review pro-
cess  to  mitigate  these  effects.  In  addition,  an  increased  number  of
U.S.-based  exporters  applied  to  operate  within  a  U.S.  foreign  trade
zone (FTZ), which provides lower tariffs for imported inputs incorpo-
rated into exported products. The share of U.S. merchandise imports
from China entering under special duty provisions for warehousing
or an FTZ increased from 11 percent in 2017 to 17 percent in 2023,
with a total of $75 billion in inputs entering these zones.‡ 105

Chinese Supply Chains Are Reducing Dependence on
Foreign-Invested Enterprises (FIEs)

Foreign (non-Chinese) firms in China have historically been an
important  source  of  China’s  exports.  Recently,  however,  domestic
Chinese firms have overtaken them as China’s leading exporters.
In  2014,  foreign-invested  enterprises  (FIEs)—which  include  sub-
sidiaries of multinational enterprises, Sino-foreign joint ventures,
and Hong Kong and Macau-funded enterprises—accounted for 46
percent of China’s total exports.106 In 2014, 60 percent of China’s
U.S.-bound exports originated from FIEs, reflecting the higher re-
liance on China as a hub for offshore production within U.S. sup-
ply chains.107 Though more recent data on China’s exports to the
United  States  by  FIEs  are  unavailable,§  FIEs’  share  of  China’s

* Though China is the largest supplier of imported inputs for manufacturing, most of the goods
used in U.S. manufacturing are sourced domestically. One study estimates that the average U.S.
manufacturing  sector  sources  88  percent  of  manufactured  inputs  by  value  added  from  within
the  United  States.  Richard  Baldwin,  Rebecca  Freeman,  and Angelos Theodorakopoulos, “Hidden
Exposure: Measuring U.S. Supply Chain Reliance,” Brookings, September 27, 2023, 16.

† In some cases, U.S. manufacturers face a tariff inversion, where tariffs on inputs used in man-
ufacturing exceed the value of the finished good, disadvantaging domestic production compared to
imports. For example, the CEO of the U.S.-based television producer Element asserts that it faces
an inverted tariff due to U.S. duties on LCD panels from China, and it is challenged to compete
on  price  with  televisions  assembled  in  Mexico  or  other  countries  and  imported  into  the  United
States. David Baer, written testimony for U.S. Senate Finance Committee, Hearing on U.S.-China
Relations: Improving U.S. Competitiveness Through Trade, April 22, 2021, 10.

‡ In  contrast,  the  share  of  U.S.  imports  from  all  other  countries  that  entered  a  warehouse  or
FTZ  fell  from  10  percent  in  2017  to  7  percent  in  2023.  U.S.  Census  Bureau,  USA Trade  Online,
September 9, 2024.

§ China  only  publishes  data  on  total  exports  by  FIEs  and  does  not  release  data  that  show  ex-
ports by destination. The 2014 estimate on exports by FIEs to the  United States was calculated
using  microdata  from  China’s  customs  agency.  Commission  staff  were  unable  to  locate  updated
calculations  based  on  these  data.  U.S.  trade  data  on  imports  from  related  parties,  where  the
importer  has  some  form  of  a  corporate  relationship  with  the  China-based  exporter,  suggest  the
role  of  FIEs  in  China’s  U.S.-bound  exports  followed  the  trend  in  its  overall  exports,  though  the
related  party  data  only  captures  a  portion  of  all  FIE  transactions  given  its  focus  on  U.S.-based
multinational  enterprises  and  exporters  and  importers  frequently  leaving  this  data  field  empty
on  customs  forms.  U.S.  imports  from  related  parties  in  China  fell  from  29  percent  in  2014  to  20
percent in 2023. U.S. Census Bureau, Imports and Exports by Related Parties, July 3, 2024; Mary

Chinese Supply Chains Are Reducing Dependence on
Foreign-Invested Enterprises (FIEs)—Continued
total exports have fallen over the past decade. Between 2014 and
2023,  FIEs’  share  of  China’s  overall  exports  fell  from  46  percent
to 28 percent.108 This decline was likely even sharper within ad-
vanced  technology  products;  FIEs’  share  of  exports  of  “high-tech
new  products”—a  category  defined  by  China’s  National  Bureau
of  Statistics—dropped  from  84  percent  in  2011  to  59  percent  in
2020.* 109 Though foreign multinationals and global supply chains
continue  to  play  a  significant  role  in  China’s  exporting  sector,
particularly  for  advanced  technology  products,  domestic  Chinese
firms are driving a growing share of China’s export activity.

Export Controls

China  asserts  itself  as  a  significant  military  power,  and  export
controls have emerged as the United States’ policy tool of choice for
denying China access to critical dual-use technologies and hindering
China’s  capacity  to  develop  such  technologies  on  its  own.  Adding
to  the  complexity  of  crafting  export  control  policy  toward  China  is
the country’s military-civil fusion policy, which blurs the distinction
between  Chinese  commercial  enterprise  and  China’s  military. With
mounting concerns over China’s military modernization, growing ag-
gressiveness  in  the  South  China  Sea,  and  posture  toward  Taiwan,
the question of how to restrict sensitive technologies that could give
China a military edge has taken on added urgency in recent years.†
China  has  capitalized  on  years  of  broad  and  mostly  unfettered
access  to  U.S.  and  allied  foundational  technologies  by  making  sig-
nificant leaps in its domestic capabilities. As U.S. policymakers have
shifted  their  assessment  of  the  threat  from  China  and  recognized
the  growing  importance  of  certain  types  of  technologies  like  ad-
vanced  semiconductors,  export  controls  have  taken  on  new  signifi-
cance  for  their  potential  ability  to  help  the  United  States  maintain
its  technological  and  military  edge. The  evolution  in  export  control
policies  faces  added  challenges  of  carefully  identifying  controlled
technologies, a fast-moving technological landscape, and fragmented
supply chains. New export controls must contend with questions on
scope, enforcement, and structure to optimize their effect.

At the same time, in the Export Control Reform Act, Congress re-
quired export controls to be evaluated on an ongoing basis to ensure
they do not inadvertently harm U.S. technological leadership, which
“requires that United States persons are competitive in global mar-
kets.” 110  Congress  has  further  stated  as  export  control  policy  that
“[e]xport controls applied unilaterally to items widely available from
foreign  sources  generally  are  less  effective  in  preventing  end-users

* Chinese  statistics  distinguish  the  high-tech  exports  from  firms  invested  by  Hong  Kong,  Ma-
cau,  and Taiwan  entities  from  those  of  all  other  foreign-invested  firms. The  latter  groups’  share

from acquiring those items. Application of unilateral export controls
should  be  limited  for  purposes  of  protecting  specific  United  States
national security and foreign policy interests.” 111 To underscore the
importance of this statement of policy, Congress requires the secre-
tary of commerce to report annually on the impact of export controls
on U.S. scientific and technological leadership.112

Changing Design of Export Controls

The United States’ approach to export controls has evolved as the
country’s  traditional  commitments  to  the  principles  of  open  trade
have  collided  with  the  realities  of  adversarial  nations  seeking  to
use U.S. technology to further their military aims. The Export Con-
trol  Reform  Act  (ECRA)  of  2018,  motivated  by  increasing  concerns
regarding the dual-use technology trade between the United States
and  China,  forms  the  foundation  of  the  current  U.S.  export  control
regime  toward  China.113  ECRA  gives  expansive  authority  to  the
president  to  control  the  export,  reexport,  and  transfer  of  items  by
U.S. or foreign nationals and corporations. It also provides “U.S. per-
sons” authority to limit the ability of U.S. individuals and companies
to  provide  support  for  certain  foreign  military-focused  activities.114
Unlike  prior  export  control  statutes,  ECRA  explicitly  regards  eco-
nomic  security  as  a  component  of  national  security  and  has  no  ex-
piration date.* 115

U.S. Export Control Infrastructure

The  Export  Administration  Regulations  (EAR)  implement
U.S. export control policy for goods and destinations, the license
applications  process  used  by  exporters,  and  the  Commerce
Control  List.† 116  Much  of  the  EAR’s  infrastructure  predates
ECRA,  though  ECRA  expanded  and  implemented  notable  re-
forms within the EAR.‡ 117 ECRA created the statutory author-
ity  for  the  Entity  List,  a  list  of  foreign  persons  and  end  uses
that  are  determined  to  be  a  threat  to  U.S.  national  security.
Exports to persons on the Entity List broadly require licensing
for  all  items  subject  to  the  EAR.  Most  persons  on  the  list  face
a  presumption  of  denial  for  licenses.118  In  recent  years,  the
Entity  List  has  been  increasingly  used  to  target  key  Chinese
firms  with  direct  ties  to  the  People’s  Liberation Army,  such  as
semiconductor  manufacturer  SMIC.§ 119

* The  act  also  mandates  a  review  of  export  license  requirements.  The  review  strengthens  the
licensing  process  for  countries  subject  to  a  comprehensive  U.S.  arms  embargo,  like  China,  and
mandates  as  part  of  the  licensing  process  an  assessment  of  the  impact  of  granting  a  license  on
the U.S. defense industrial base.

† The  Commerce  Control  List  is  a  list  of  dual-use  technologies  subject  to  controls  under  the
EAR. The  Bureau  of  Industry  and  Security  (BIS)  within  the  Department  of  Commerce  adminis-
ters the EAR. Paul K. Kerr and Christopher A. Casey, “The U.S. Export Control System and the
Export Control Reform Act of 2018,” Congressional Research Service CRS R 46814, June 7, 2021.
‡ Separate  regulations  control  nuclear  materials  and  technology  and  defense  articles  and  ser-
vices. U.S. law has expanded to prohibit arms sales to China since 1989. The United States also
maintains a policy of denial for exports of satellite and space equipment to China. Karen M. Sut-
ter  and  Christopher A.  Casey, “U.S.  Export  Controls  and  China,”  Congressional  Research  Service

§ While  the  Entity  List  is  the  primary  list  containing  parties  of  concern,  BIS  also  maintains
a  Denied  Persons  List,  which  contains  entities  that  are  fully  denied  export  privileges,  and  an
Unverified  List,  which  contains  entities  that  cannot  receive  license  exceptions  and  require  addi-
tional  scrutiny.  U.S.  Department  of  Commerce  Bureau  of  Industry  and  Security,  Denied  Persons

U.S. Export Control Infrastructure—Continued

The  EAR  also  regulates  the  transfer  of  controlled  technologies
to a foreign person within the United States, often called “deemed
exports,”  by  requiring  a  license.  Such  licenses  are  typically  used
by  universities,  advanced  technology  research  and  development
institutions,  biochemical  firms,  and  the  medical  and  advanced
computing  sectors,  which  often  rely  on  highly  trained  foreign
persons to support their research and development (R&D) activi-
ties.120 Some concerns have been raised that China is seeking to
take advantage of the United States’ open research environments
to  circumvent  export  controls,  heightening  the  importance  of  the
deemed export rules.121

A powerful but—until recently—rarely used tool is the Foreign
Direct  Product  Rule  (FDPR),  which  regulates  the  reexport  and
transfer of any foreign-made items if their production directly in-
volves  certain  technology,  software,  or  equipment  that  originates
from  the  United  States,  even  if  the  item  was  produced  outside
of  the  United  States  by  a  foreign  entity.122  The  Commerce  De-
partment has recently utilized the FDPR in conjunction with the
Entity  List  to  limit  the  ability  of  targeted  entities  to  sidestep
U.S. controls by sourcing restricted products from companies out-
side  the  United  States.  For  example,  the  department  used  the
rule  against  China  in  2020  to  help  improve  and  expand  the  ef-
fectiveness of controls targeting Huawei.* Specifically, Commerce
used  the  FDPR  to  expand  controls  that  restricted  direct  exports
of  U.S.  semiconductors  by  also  controlling  exports  to  Huawei  of
products  made  with  U.S.  technology  (even  products  made  whol-
ly  outside  the  United  States  by  foreign  firms)  that  support  the
manufacture of semiconductors.123 (For more on Huawei, see “Ef-
fects  of  Export  Controls”  later  in  this  chapter.)  In  mid-2024,  the
Department  of  Commerce  announced  an  expansion  of  the  FDPR
rules,  albeit  with  exclusions  for  key  semiconductor  manufactur-
ing  equipment-producing  countries  like  Japan,  the  Netherlands,
and South Korea, by (1) prohibiting exports to more Chinese end
users and (2) lowering the percentage of U.S. content required to
trigger the rule.† 124

ECRA  tasked  the  Administration  with  creating  an  interagen-
cy  process  to  define  and  place  controls  on  emerging  and  foun-
dational  technologies.‡  However,  the  Commission’s  2023  Annual

* Before the FDPR was updated, Huawei was able to maintain access to the supply of advanced
foreign  chips  because  it  could  still  purchase  chips  produced  by  non-U.S.  firms  made  using  U.S.
technology  (e.g.,  semiconductor  manufacturing  equipment).  Given  the  widespread  prevalence  of
U.S. technology at some level in most steps of the semiconductor design and manufacturing pro-
cess, the expanded FDPR rule significantly expanded the practical scope of the controls. Gregory

Report  identified  that  “despite  increasing  the  number  of  specif-
ically  named  Chinese  entities  barred  from  receiving  technology,
the  Department  of  Commerce’s  Bureau  of  Industry  and  Security
(BIS)  has  made  limited  progress  in  expanding  the  scope  of  tech-
nologies  controlled.  In  2018,  ECRA  tasked  the  agency  with  iden-
tifying  ‘emerging  and  foundational’  technologies  and  imposing
controls  where  necessary,  but  BIS  has  not  identified  any  founda-
tional technologies.” 125 In a May 2022 statement, BIS announced
it  would  no  longer  attempt  to  distinguish  between  emerging  and
foundational  technologies.126  Instead,  BIS  would  refer  to  such
technologies  as  Section  1758  technologies  since  there  were  defi-
nitional  challenges  to  distinguishing  between  the  two  and  there
were few practical implications of the distinction, noting that “the
categorization of the technologies has sometimes delayed the im-
position  of  controls.” 127  In  his  written  testimony  to  the  Commis-
sion, partner at the law firm Akin and a former Assistant Secre-
tary  of  Commerce  for  Export  Administration  in  BIS  Kevin  Wolf
stated  that  “BIS  has  published  the  first  unilateral  controls  on
[emerging  and  foundational  technologies]  with  its  October  2022
[semiconductor-related] rule described above, which clearly meets
the spirit and purpose of Section 1758, although not the letter of
the section.” 128

Controls  on  advanced  semiconductors  reflect  a  realization  that
because  certain  technologies  are  so  foundational  to  advanced  mili-
tary capabilities, they need to be controlled more broadly than pre-
viously  envisioned  for  dual-use  technologies.  In  testimony  before
the  Commission,  nonresident  fellow  at  the  Carnegie  Endowment
for International Peace Peter Harrell commended the October 2022
semiconductor  controls.  He  argued  that  they  leveraged  chokepoints
effectively,  delineated  clear  objectives,  and  were  devised  to  reduce
diversions  and  workarounds,  reflecting  lessons  learned  from  previ-
ous controls targeting specific Chinese firms.129 BIS export controls
on semiconductors expanded in 2022 from an approach that covered
a  small  number  of  companies  in  China  to  broader  country-based
controls  on  both  semiconductors  and  semiconductor  manufacturing
equipment.  BIS  expanded  semiconductor  controls  again  in  October
2023 to cover additional types of semiconductors and semiconductor
manufacturing  equipment.  Mr.  Harrell  sees  the  flexibility  and  iter-
ative  approach  shown  by  BIS  as  strengths  that  allow  the  United
States to “address gaps and workarounds as they are identified” and
“reduce the odds of unintended consequences.” 130 A similar iterative
process  could  be  used  to  expand  controls  as  future  emerging  tech-
nologies  take  on  stronger  national  security  implications,  including
quantum  information  science,  AI  (to  the  extent  not  covered  by  ex-
isting controls on advanced semiconductors needed for AI systems),

communication  and  networking  technologies,  directed  energy,  financial  technologies,  human-ma-
chine interfaces, hypersonics, networked sensors and sensing, quantum information technologies,
renewable  energy  generation  and  storage,  semiconductors  and  microelectronics,  and  space  tech-
nologies and systems. John P. Barker et al., “White House Releases Updated Critical and Emerg-
ing Technologies List,” Arnold & Porter, February 28, 2024.

robotics, and biotechnology. (For more on U.S.-China technology com-
petition in these sectors, see Chapter 3, “U.S.-China Competition in
Emerging Technologies.”)

While  recent  attention  has  focused  on  advanced  technology  prod-
ucts,  particularly  the  most  advanced  semiconductors  and  semicon-
ductor  manufacturing  equipment,  some  experts  have  recommended
that  the  United  States  review  more  traditional  dual-use  technolo-
gies to identify whether other sensitive chokepoints exist that could
hinder  China’s  ability  to  develop  or  advance  its  own  dual-use  in-
dustries—for  example,  civilian  aerospace.  China’s  leadership  has
repeatedly expressed anxiety about its reliance on certain high-end
electronic components and specialized steel alloys that are manufac-
tured  by  a  small  number  of  U.S.  or  allied  companies;  these  inputs
currently have no viable high-end Chinese competitors and will like-
ly take years or more to duplicate.131

Plurilateral vs. Unilateral Export Controls

Due  to  the  interconnected  nature  of  the  global  trade  ecosystem
and  the  lack  of  tangible  methods  to  track  or  control  the  final  des-
tinations  of  physical  goods,  the  effectiveness  and  sustainability  of
export controls relies on the cooperation of allies and partners. The
United States has traditionally preferred to take a multilateral ap-
proach  to  export  controls  for  three  reasons.132  First,  this  approach
ensures  maximum  effectiveness  of  controls  since  the  controls  block
trade from a broader range of potential sources of the technology for
the  targeted  country  or  entity.133  Second,  a  multilateral  approach
improves  enforcement;  absent  geolocation  solutions  that  could  re-
motely shut off technology if it travels outside of a proscribed area,
preventing  reexport  of  restricted  goods  relies  on  allied  cooperation,
tracking,  and  enforcement  systems.134  Third,  broad  adherence  to  a
uniform set of controls ensures that firms in other countries do not
merely “backfill”  U.S.  exports,  which  would  both  limit  the  effective-
ness of the controls and potentially harm U.S. interests by redirect-
ing  revenue  needed  to  sustain  R&D  away  from  U.S.  firms  to  their
international competitors.135 In the long run, unilateral controls can
create  a  structural  regulatory  and  economic  incentive  for  U.S.  com-
panies and their foreign competitors to develop technologies outside
the United States with non-U.S. technology and content. This would
undercut  the  U.S.  export  control  goal  of  maintaining  the  country’s
technological leadership.

Experience, however, indicates that U.S. leadership on export con-
trols via unilateral implementation can convince allied countries to
follow.  Allied  countries  contend  with  their  own  domestic  interests
that  are  concerned  about  losing  access  to  profitable  markets. When
the  United  States  implements  export  controls  ahead  of  allied  coun-
tries,  this  can  help  allied  governments  overcome  domestic  political
constraints.136  Plurilateral  controls  also  face  constraints  based  on
the  varying  legal  powers  of  foreign  governments  and  the  resources
available  to  devote  to  enforcement  and  ongoing  international  coop-
eration.137

The  October  2022  controls  on  advanced  semiconductor  and  semi-
conductor  manufacturing  equipment  exports  to  China  provide  an
example.138  While  U.S.  companies  design  some  of  the  most  sophis-

426

ticated  semiconductors  and  are  among  the  leaders  in  semiconduc-
tor  manufacturing  equipment,  companies  in  Europe  and  East  Asia
also play critical roles in the production of the chips themselves and
certain  high-end  chip-making  equipment.139  Initially,  the  October
2022  rules  were  imposed  unilaterally  by  the  United  States,  though
they  did  expand  restrictions  and  licensing  requirements  on  some
foreign-produced  items.140 Aware  of  the  need  to  multilateralize  the
rules for effectiveness, the United States designed the rules in con-
sultation  with  key  allies  and  worked  to  bring  them  along.  Japan
and  the  Netherlands,  home  to  a  number  of  companies  key  to  ad-
vanced  semiconductor  production,  have  since  imposed  similar  con-
trols based on the U.S. rollout.141 By moving first, the United States
was  able  to  quickly  target  China’s  ability  to  purchase  key  semicon-
ductor  manufacturing  equipment  supplied  by  the  United  States,
which  could  have  enabled  more  advanced  domestic  semiconductor
manufacturing capability.142 With the United States having demon-
strated  commitment  to  sacrificing  some  short-term  economic  gain
for  longer-term  security,  the  Netherlands  and  Japan  also  agreed  to
limit their own exports of advanced equipment to China and to ab-
stain from developing products that would have otherwise filled the
gap  left  by  U.S.  firms.143  In April  2024,  Japan  expanded  its  export
controls to include additional types of semiconductor manufacturing
equipment,  following  the  United  States’  lead  in  its  October  2023
expansion of its semiconductor controls.144

Still, most other countries have not imposed export controls to the
same  extent  as  the  United  States.  Many  countries  currently  lack  a
legal regime that allows them to target controls to specific entities of
concern  versus  broader  country-targeted  controls,  which  have  been
the  traditional  approach  of  multilateral  regimes.  Other  countries
have  also  been  hesitant  to  adopt  analogues  to  the  “U.S.  persons”
controls,  which  limit  the  ability  of  U.S.  individuals  and  companies
to  support  Chinese  semiconductor  development  and  ongoing  servic-
ing  of  certain  equipment.  While  Japan’s  enhanced  export  controls
on  semiconductor  equipment  apply  to  all  exports,  not  just  China’s,
and Japan does implement catch-all end user restrictions related to
the exports of certain technologies, it does not prohibit non-resident
Japanese persons from servicing existing semiconductor machinery.
The  United  States  has  pressed  both  Japan  and  the  Netherlands
to  implement  restrictions  on  ongoing  maintenance  and  servicing
of  chip-making  equipment  already  in  China,  without  which  their
ongoing  ability  to  produce  cutting-edge  chips  would  deteriorate.145
This  concern  is  significant  given  the  capabilities  and  large  amount
of semiconductor manufacturing equipment China procured both be-
fore  the  controls  were  announced  and  between  the  announcement
and when it went into effect.146

Traditional  multilateral  frameworks  for  export  controls,  set  up
to  control  conventional  and  nuclear  weapons,  have  not  adapted
well to modern challenges of dual-use technologies and changes in
geopolitical  realities.*  The  four  existing  multilateral  export  con-
trol  regimes  are  informal  arrangements  whereby  member  coun-
tries  can  coordinate  policies  and  exchange  information  and  best

practices for various types of weapons-related products and tech-
nologies.147  Each  regime  is  consensus-based  and  does  not  have
legally binding rules. Some regimes have only limited self-report-
ing  on  adherence.  Additionally,  a  drawback  of  consensus-based
regimes  is  that  a  single  state  can  veto  important  decisions  like
admitting new members or updating the control lists. Since 2021,
Russia  has  effectively  neutralized  new  decisions  under  the  Was-
senaar  Arrangement,  which  serves  to  control  dual-use  items  in
addition  to  conventional  arms.148

Bilateral and mini-lateral coordination could provide one solution,
particularly  for  technologies  with  only  a  few  commercial  producers.
Negotiations and controls could move faster, be nimbler, and poten-
tially  involve  higher  levels  of  coordination  by  having  fewer  coun-
tries  involved.149  As  the  United  States  has  conferred  with  nations
in  smaller  settings,  a  new  consensus  has  emerged  on  the  need  to
control  items  such  as  semiconductors. The  informal  cooperation  be-
tween  the  United  States,  Japan,  and  the  Netherlands  with  respect
to  semiconductor  and  semiconductor  manufacturing  equipment
controls  provides  an  example  of  the  benefits  of  and  possibilities  for
mini-lateral  approaches.  In  a  statement  after  a  trilateral  meeting
with representatives from Japan and South Korea, the Department
of Commerce affirmed the national security significance of semicon-
ductors  and  referenced  the  role  of  the  trilateral  U.S.-Japan-Repub-
lic  of  Korea  Disruptive  Technology  Protection  Network,  launched
in  April  2024,  in  combating  illicit  technology  transfer.150  Another
example  is  the Trilateral  Security  Partnership  between  the  United
States, the United Kingdom, and Australia (AUKUS). In June 2023,
the  United  States  announced  formal  collaboration  with  its AUKUS
partners—the  UK  and  Australia—on  export  control  enforcement,
which  would  involve  knowledge  sharing  and  other  cooperation.151
This effort has helped spur AUKUS countries to align their relevant
lists  of  controlled  equipment  and  technology  and  permit  exceptions
where needed to ensure that trade in these goods between the three
countries  faces  fewer  restrictions.152  Even  with  a  small  number  of
countries,  challenges  can  emerge  when  export  control  policy  is  not
aligned or allied governments lack the legal authority to impose the
types  of  controls  used  by  the  United  States.  Progress  in  AUKUS
has  reportedly  been  slowed  by  the  gap  between  the  United  States’
controls and those of the UK and Australia.153

Export Control Outcomes at the U.S.-EU Trade and
Technology Council

The  U.S.-EU  Trade  and  Technology  Council  (TTC)  has  helped
advance  transatlantic  communication  on  export  controls  in  some
aspects,  such  as  evasion  and  diversion  efforts  in  exports  to  Rus-
sia  and  Iran,  but  significant  challenges  remain  in  coordinating
controls  on  sensitive  technology  flows  to  China.  In  June  2021,
the  United  States  and  the  EU  established  the  TTC  in  an  effort
to deepen ties and coordination on approaches to trade, technolo-
gy, and security.154 The TTC hosts ten working groups, including
groups  on  export  control  cooperation  and  investment  screening

Technology Council—Continued
cooperation.*  Although  China  is  not  explicitly  mentioned  in  the
TTC’s  outlined  mission,  addressing  China’s  increasing  influence
is  a  point  of  focus  for  the  TTC.  Toward  that  end,  the  TTC  has
produced  tangible  policy  developments,  including  plans  to  oper-
ationalize  a  joint  early  warning  mechanism  for  disruptions  in
semiconductor  supply  chains  and  the  development  of  a  joint  AI
Roadmap.155 The  United  States  and  EU  have  also  set  up  a  plat-
form  to  share  information,  including  about  export  control  licens-
es.156

In  addition  to  EU-level  efforts  on  a  broad  set  of  issues,  indi-
vidual  European  countries  have  also  partnered  with  the  Unit-
ed  States  to  confront  China’s  growing  challenge.  For  example,
in  March  2023,  the  Netherlands  joined  the  United  States  in  re-
stricting  exports  of  semiconductor  manufacturing  technology  to
China.157

However,  despite  a  broad  commitment  to  “promote  convergent
control  approaches  on  sensitive  dual-use  technologies,”  the  TTC
has not resulted in concrete goals or timelines for fundamentally
reforming  the  multilateral  export  control  system  or  creating  a
unified  approach  to  export  controls  on  China.  In  fact,  it  remains
unclear  if  the  TTC  can  be  leveraged  in  this  way.158  Particularly,
there is no EU level uniform export control policy, and EU mem-
ber states retain autonomy over matters of national security and
investment.159

Bringing Allies and Partners on Board

As  Mr.  Wolf  testified,  broad  plurilateral  controls  will  only  be
agreed  to  if  allies  believe  the  controls  are  in  their  national  securi-
ty  interests,  which  requires  outreach  and  engagement  on  the  part
of  the  United  States.  In  testimony  before  the  Commission  in  May
2024,  regional  experts  on  industry  and  trade  policies  argued  that
many allies and partners in the Asia Pacific, Latin America and the
Caribbean, and Europe still do not understand or agree with the na-
tional  security  justification  for  U.S.  controls.160 To  the  extent  allies
believe  export  controls  are  about  giving  the  United  States  an  eco-
nomic advantage rather than addressing national security concerns,
they  are  less  likely  to  implement  parallel  domestic  export  controls.
In  written  testimony  for  the  Commission,  Mr.  Wolf  articulated  his
view that “if ever the justification for a new control is solely to help
U.S.  industry  succeed  economically,  it  will  always  eventually  result
in  precisely  the  opposite  outcome  because  no  ally  is  going  to  agree
to a plurilateral control just to help U.S. industry.” 161 Furthermore,
based  on  dialogues  with  foreign  governments,  think  tanks,  indus-
try, and media, Mr. Wolf believes many countries outside the United

States take the view that only items with a “direct and immediately
identifiable relationship to the development, production, or use of a
weapon” should be subject to export controls.162

Outreach to help countries better understand burgeoning national
security threats has proven effective. The United States used exten-
sive outreach efforts to expose the security threat of Chinese compo-
nents in global telecommunications networks. Former U.S. Undersec-
retary of State for Economic Growth, Energy, and the Environment
Keith Krach led a team working with allied countries’ governments
and telecom corporations to reduce the presence of equipment man-
ufactured  by  Chinese  firm  Huawei  in  telecom  infrastructure.163  In
addition  to  helping  other  nations  understand  the  national  security
justifications for new controls on Huawei equipment, U.S. efforts at
coordination with allies and like-minded countries also helped over-
come fears of Chinese retaliation; by being a part of a wider group,
each country had a buffer against Chinese pressure.164

Effects of Export Controls

U.S.  and  allied  export  controls  have  slowed  China’s  technologi-
cal  advancement  and  made  it  more  difficult  for  Russia  to  procure
components  for  weapons  systems.  Maintaining  and  improving  the
effectiveness of export controls has required cooperation with allies,
continuous adjustments and additions to the export control  regime,
and coordination with other economic tools like sanctions. However,
experts  continue  to  raise  concerns  over  how  long  these  initial  suc-
cesses will last as China focuses its efforts on becoming a self-suffi-
cient manufacturer of legacy and high-end chips.

Enforcement in the United States and other countries has encoun-
tered  a  number  of  difficulties.  Chinese  firms  stockpiled  equipment
from  key  Dutch  and  Japanese  firms  in  the  period  between  when
export  controls  were  announced  and  when  they  went  into  effect.165
Even after the effective date of the controls, China continues to be a
major  buyer  of  lower-end  semiconductor  manufacturing  equipment
not  subject  to  current  controls.  ASML’s  equipment  sales  to  China
surged  in  2024.166  Industry  experts  have  claimed  that  South  Ko-
rean *  and  Japanese †  firms  also  continue  to  sell  machines,  compo-
nents,  spare  parts,  and  materials  to  Chinese  firms  that  U.S.  firms
would  not  be  able  to  sell  due  to  U.S.  restrictions.167  Chinese  firms
have  also  demonstrated  the  ability  to  use  new  or  renamed  shell
companies to avoid enforcement.168

China  has  intensified  efforts  to  design  out  foreign  components  in
its  chip-making  processes. To  build  out  domestic  supply  chains,  the
Chinese government provides financial support to subsidize Chinese
chip companies using domestic technology and materials as much as
possible  in  their  production  processes.169  Huawei  itself  plays  a  key
role  in  nurturing  China’s  semiconductor  ecosystem.170  Since  being

they would seek additional incentives from the United States in exchange for further tightening

added  to  the  Entity  List  and  targeted  with  the  FDPR,  Huawei  has
doubled  down  on  developing  access  to  domestic  alternatives  for  ad-
vanced chips. Huawei has benefitted from direct subsidies and pref-
erential contracts with the Chinese government.171 These subsidies,
along  with  Huawei’s  still  flourishing  telecommunications  business,
gave  it  the  financial  resources  to  weather  the  initial  drop  in  reve-
nue  from  lost  smartphone  sales  and  continue  investing  in  R&D.172
In 2022, Huawei filed patents for proprietary ultraviolet technology,
indicating  that  it  was  trying  to  reduce  reliance  on  imported ASML
equipment.173  At  the  same  time,  China  has  focused  on  increasing
production capacity for legacy chips, which provide much of the com-
puting power needed to modernize China’s military and are critical
for a wide range of supply chains.174

Examination of Chinese domestic chip manufacturers and smart-
phone  makers  indicates  that  China’s  efforts  to  reduce  its  reliance
on  imported  semiconductors  and  chip  manufacturing  equipment
have been slowed by export controls. Although Huawei’s smartphone
business  showed  signs  of  recovery  four  years  after  the  Department
of  Commerce  tightened  export  controls,  it  is  clear  that  China’s
technology  still  lags  behind  the  leading  global  chip  producers.175
In  2023,  Huawei  released  a  new  smartphone  powered  by  high-end
Chinese-made  chips,*  but  these  chips  trailed  the  world’s  most  ad-
vanced chips in size, energy efficiency, and cost.176 Huawei’s smart-
phones demonstrated increased self-sufficiency in the percentage of
Chinese  components  in  new  models  released  in  2024,  but  the  pace
of  advancement  in  semiconductor  technology  appeared  to  slow.177
Huawei  reportedly  will  soon  release  a  new  AI  chip  to  replace  U.S.
chips blocked from export to China by export controls.178 Equipment
stockpiles  helped  but  likely  did  not  solve  constraints  in  fabrication
capacity,  and  China  remains  dependent  on  foreign  lithography
equipment.179

Coordination between the United States and Europe has played a
key role in the effectiveness of export controls on Russia.180 Export
controls  and  sanctions  have  been  used  in  concert  to  increase  their
effectiveness  in  safeguarding  national  security,  particularly  when
export  controls  alone  are  not  enough  to  deter  aggressive  action  by
an adversary. In late 2021 and early 2022, the G7 sought to use the
threat of sanctions and export controls to deter Russia from attack-
ing  Ukraine.181  While  this  effort  was  ultimately  unsuccessful,  the
imposition of export controls after Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, cou-
pled with sanctions that limited the country’s access to financial re-
sources,  have  degraded  Russia’s  military  industrial  base  by  forcing
it  to  pivot  away  from  Western  technology.182  After  the  G7  imposed
export  controls  on  Russia,  Russia  shifted  to  China  and  other  coun-
tries, such as Turkey and Iran, to procure replacement goods.183

However, Chinese firms are playing a role in helping Russia evade
export  controls  and  procure  controlled  inputs  for  weapons  systems
used  against  Ukraine. A  battlefield  report  on  export  controls  found
that  of  2,800  different  non-Russian  components  that  experts  recov-
ered  from  Russian  weapons  in  Ukraine,  almost  all  of  the  compo-

nents—95  percent—originated  from  Western  firms.184  To  address
the  flow  of  dual-use  goods  from  these  countries  to  Russia,  in  De-
cember  2023  the  Administration  issued  an  EO  authorizing  sanc-
tions against third country banks that facilitate the sale of dual-use
goods to Russia.185 At the same time, continued transshipment from
China  and  Hong  Kong  in  particular  has  eroded  these  export  con-
trols  and  allowed  controlled  materials  to  end  up  on  the  battlefield.
(For  more  on  China’s  support  for  Russia’s  war  effort,  see  Chapter
2,  “U.S.-China  Security  and  Foreign  Affairs  (Year  in  Review).”  For
more on Hong Kong’s role in export control evasion, see Chapter 10,
“Hong Kong.”) Russia has also been attempting to grow its domestic
production capacity for military and dual-use goods, often with Chi-
nese technical support.186

Investment Screening

Like trade, investment flows between the United States and Chi-
na have become inextricably linked with national security concerns.
Cross-border  investment  can  be  broken  into  two  categories:  direct
investment  and  portfolio  investment.  Portfolio  investment  covers
transactions involving equity or debt securities of an enterprise but
typically does not translate into direct management oversight or in-
put into the business beyond shareholder voting rights. In contrast,
direct  investment  typically  involves  transactions  that  provide  own-
ership  of  10  percent  or  more,  establishing  a  lasting  interest  in  and
a significant degree of influence over an enterprise.

Chinese  investment  into  the  United  States  has  the  potential  to
be  a  conduit  for  technology  transfer  and  can  provide  China  with
leverage over key sectors of the U.S. economy.187 Yet from the other
direction,  U.S.  investment  into  China  can  provide  needed  funding
and transfer intangible benefits—such as managerial expertise and
broader awareness and sophistication about technology markets and
business models—to advanced technology companies, which in turn
have  the  potential  to  enhance  Chinese  military  capabilities.188  To
ensure  that  cross-border  investments  do  not  imperil  national  secu-
rity, the United States has expanded its inbound investment screen-
ing  regime  to  further  scrutinize  Chinese  direct  investment  into  the
United  States.  It  is  now  also  pursuing  the  creation  of  an  outbound
investment screening regime that may look at both direct and port-
folio investment.

Inbound Investment Screening

Chinese  inbound  direct  investment  in  the  United  States  has  de-
clined  substantially  since  2017.*  U.S.  Bureau  of  Economic Analysis
(BEA) data show that new Chinese foreign direct investment (FDI)
peaked  in  2016  at  $27.4  billion  before  plummeting  97.7  percent  to
$621  million  in  2023.† 189  As  of  2023,  Chinese  entities  held  $62.4

* Unless  otherwise  noted,  assume  any  data  on  investment  stock  or  flows  involving  China  in-

clude investment originating from or directed to Hong Kong and Macau.

† This  trend  matches  alternative  data  sources  such  as  those  compiled  by  Rhodium  Group,  an
independent  research  provider,  though  they  capture  a  higher  overall  value  for  investment  and
find that annual investment has dropped from $46 billion in 2016 to less than $5 billion in 2022.
The discrepancy in values between the BEA and Rhodium Group data is partially the result of of-
ficial data being distorted by companies’ usage of holding companies, offshore vehicles, and other
complex ownership structures to take advantage of favorable tax policies. Complicated deal struc-
tures  with “indirect”  holdings  also  make  it  difficult  for  statistical  agencies  to  correctly  separate

432

billion  of  FDI  stock  in  the  United  States.190  Policy  changes  in  both
the  United  States  and  China  contributed  to  the  fall.  Starting  in
2016  and  continuing  through  2017,  China  directed  its  domestic  in-
vestors  to  reduce  certain  foreign  holdings  and  tightened  the  coun-
try’s  capital  controls.191  In  2018,  the  United  States  passed  the  For-
eign  Investment  Risk  Review  Modernization  Act  (FIRRMA),  which
expanded  the  jurisdiction  of  the  Committee  on  Foreign  Investment
in  the  United  States  (CFIUS)  to  block  sensitive  investments,  most
notably from China.192

CFIUS is an interagency committee chaired by the U.S. secretary
of  the  treasury  that  reviews  certain  FDI  transactions  in  the  U.S.
economy  to  ensure  they  do  not  impair  U.S.  national  security.*  FIR-
RMA strengthened and modernized CFIUS’s capacity to take a more
assertive  role  in  scrutinizing  U.S.  inbound  investment  by  broaden-
ing  the  scope  of  transactions  CFIUS  can  or  must  review,  shifting
the filing requirement from voluntary to mandatory in certain more
sensitive  transactions,  expanding  the  range  of  national  security  is-
sues  to  be  considered,  and  providing  more  staff  and  funding  to  the
organization.193 While  the  new  scrutiny  enabled  by  FIRRMA  likely
contributed  to  a  drop  in  Chinese  direct  investment  into  the  United
States,  it  has  not  changed  the  United  States’  role  as  the  largest
global  recipient  of  FDI.194  From  2013  to  2017,  prior  to  FIRRMA’s
passage, the United States accounted for 17.4 percent of global FDI
inflows.195 From 2018 to 2023, the United States’ share rose to 19.1
percent of global inflows.196

FIRRMA helped trigger a global expansion of inbound investment
review regimes, restricting Chinese access to key technologies across
a range of different economies. The act directed the U.S. Department
of the Treasury to “facilitate the harmonization of action” on inbound
investments by conferring favored status within CFIUS on countries
with  their  own  reliable  screening  mechanisms.197  In  part  because
of  this,  at  least  37  countries  now  have  regulatory  frameworks  for
screening investments on national security grounds, including most
EU members, the UK, and Japan.198

Outbound Investment Screening

While  negotiating  FIRRMA,  policymakers  debated  the  merits  of
restricting or screening U.S. outbound investments to China.199 Pro-
ponents  hoped  to  address  many  of  the  same  concerns  that  drive
existing  restrictions,  such  as  export  controls—namely  to  prevent
U.S.  resources  from  helping  an  adversary  country  advance  tech-
nologically.  Critics  feared  new  restrictions  would  undermine  the
United  States’  position  as  the  preeminent  global  capital  market.200
Ultimately,  a  proposed  outbound  investment  program  was  excluded
from  FIRRMA.201  Since  FIRRMA’s  enactment,  policymakers  have

FDI  from  portfolio  investment  stakes  in  the  surveys  they  use  to  collect  their  data.  Alternative
data  providers  like  Rhodium  Group  attempt  to  rectify  this  by  taking  a  transactional  approach
that tracks and captures individual transactions. Thilo Hanemann, Armand Meyer, and Danielle

returned to outbound investment issues, in part in response to con-
tinued concerns over U.S. investment into China.202

The Scale of U.S. Outbound Investments into China

Inadequate  official  U.S.  government  data  collection  and  publica-
tion  obscures  the  scale  and  sectoral  allocation  of  U.S.  investments
into  China.  Publicly  accessible  official  U.S.  government  data  do  not
show  U.S.  investor  positions  based  on  the  ultimate  destination  of
their  direct  and  portfolio  investments;  instead,  they  permit  the  re-
porting  of  trillions  of  dollars  of  investment  in  the  Cayman  Islands
or other Caribbean islands. The data that is accessible is categorized
too  broadly  to  discern  the  technologies  or  industries  that  U.S.  in-
vestment benefits. Private data providers can address some of these
issues,  but  drawbacks  in  their  collection  methods  mean  they  still
present an imperfect picture at best. Nevertheless, both official and
private  data  sources  suggest  that  while  total  U.S.  outbound  invest-
ment flows to China have substantially declined in recent years, di-
rect investment in particular has become increasingly concentrated
in innovative sectors with implications for U.S. national security.203

Official U.S. Data on U.S. Outbound Investments into China

At  the  end  of  2023,  U.S.  official  data  showed  the  total  U.S.  di-
rect  investment  stock  in  mainland  China  to  be  $126.9  billion.204
Including  Hong  Kong  and  Macau,  U.S.  direct  investment  rises  to
$218.5 billion, or 3.3 percent of total U.S. direct investment stock.205
As  of  2022,  the  most  recent  year  with  complete  data,  accumulated
U.S. portfolio investment stock in mainland China was a much more
sizable $712 billion.206 Including Hong Kong and  Macau, U.S.  port-
folio  investment  stock  rises  to  $910  billion  ($860  billion  in  equity
investments and $50 billion in bonds), or 8.5 percent of U.S. foreign
investment stock.207

In  recent  years,  the  growth  of  U.S.  direct  investment  into  China
has steadily declined. From 2008 until 2018, U.S. FDI into China in-
creased by an average of $10.4 billion a year. From 2019 to 2023, the
growth rate nearly halved, falling to $5.6 billion a year.208 Since the
end of 2020, the value of U.S portfolio stock has been falling, though
a significant portion of that likely resulted from a reduction in Chi-
nese company valuations rather than a reduction in volume.* 209 In
2022, the value of U.S. portfolio investment stock fell by $258.7 bil-
lion compared with 2021.210

Limitations of Official U.S. Data Sources on Outbound Investment

A  key  challenge  that  has  plagued  discussions  around  a  U.S.  out-
bound  investment  mechanism—and  the  broader  U.S.-China  finan-
cial  relationship—has  been  a  lack  of  reliable,  official  data  released
by  the  U.S.  government.  The  Bureau  of  Economic  Analysis  (BEA)
under the Commerce Department and the Treasury Department are
the  primary  government  bodies  responsible  for  collecting  and  pub-

around  the  collection  and  public  reporting  of  U.S.  outbound  invest-
ment  statistics  likely  obscure  the  ultimate  scale  of  these  flows  and
prevent  a  detailed  assessment  of  U.S.  direct  and  portfolio  invest-
ment in China.212

U.S.  direct  investment  statistics  reflect  the  place  of  incorporation
of  the  immediate  investment  counterpart,  which  is  not  necessarily
the country that domiciles the ultimate beneficial owner (UBO).† 214
As  a  result,  the  $700  billion  in  reported  direct  investment  stock  in
offshore  tax  havens  such  as  Caribbean  island  non-banking  holding
companies  and  financial  firms,  for  example,  likely  masks  consider-
able additional investment flowing into China.215 Legal restrictions
within  the  International  Investment  and Trade  in  Services  Survey
Act—which  governs  how  the  BEA  is  able  to  collect  outbound  direct
investment  data—protect  the  confidentiality  of  the  data  that  is  re-
leased.216

These  privacy  restrictions  mean  the  sectoral  breakdowns  of  U.S.
official data are also too broad to discern investment shifts into sec-
tors  most  relevant  for  national  security.  It  is  impossible  to  figure

* Every five years, through the Benchmark Survey of U.S. Direct Investment Abroad, the BEA
collects data on the universe of foreign affiliates of U.S. entities, including detailed balance sheet
and ownership information. By combining the data collected in the Benchmark Survey with data
from  the  BEA’s  Quarterly  Survey  of  U.S.  Direct  Investment Abroad,  BEA  researchers  have  pro-
posed a methodology to reallocate the U.S. direct investment abroad position to the countries and
industries  where  it  is  ultimately  invested.  This  reallocation  suggests  substantial  U.S.  outbound
investment flows to the Cayman Islands and other tax havens are eventually routed to China. For
example, using data from the 2019 Benchmark Survey, researchers found that in 2019 the U.S. di-
rect investment position in mainland China could be valued at $240 billion, or $140 billion dollars
more than what was estimated for that year in official BEA statistics. However, the reallocation
methods provide an  imperfect and incomplete  picture. Additional data would be needed to regu-
larly publish direct investment statistics that attribute investment to the ultimate host economy.

out  how  much  U.S.  direct  investment  is  flowing  into  China  across
areas  such  as  AI,  quantum  computing,  and  semiconductors,  given
that the most detailed U.S. data end at “manufacturing of electrical
equipment, appliances, and components,” “information,” and “profes-
sional,  scientific,  and  technical  services.” 217  The  BEA  argues  this
is  to  prevent  its  data  from  being  used  to  discern  information  about
individual transactions, though analysts have challenged this as be-
ing overly cautious.218

Data on U.S. portfolio investment in China suffer from issues sim-
ilar to those of direct investment. The Treasury Department’s Trea-
sury  International  Capital  (TIC)  system  does  not  provide  the  UBO
of  outbound  portfolio  investment  transactions.219  However,  other
parts  of  the  Federal  Government  such  as  the  Federal  Reserve  are
able  to  reconstruct  portfolio  investment  beneficial  ownership  data-
sets,  though  with  a  severe  time  lag.220  Neither  the  TIC  nor  any
other  parts  of  the  Federal  Government  publish  outbound  portfolio
investment data organized by investment sector.221

Alternative Estimates of U.S. Direct Investment into China

Private  sector  data  sources,  such  as  Pitchbook  and  fDi  Markets,
can  be  an  imperfect  solution  to  the  inadequacies  of  official  direct
investment  statistics.  However,  unlike  official  sources  such  as  the
BEA,  which  impose  mandatory  reporting  requirements,  private
data  collection  firms  must  rely  on  methods  that  are  inherently  in-
complete.*  Still,  Pitchbook,  a  private  data  provider,  can  provide  in-
sight  into  non-greenfield  (mergers  and  acquisitions,  private  equity,
and  venture  investment)  U.S.  investment,  which  captures  the  lion’s
share of U.S. direct investment to China.† According to calculations
using Pitchbook data by Sarah Baurle Danzman, associate professor
at  Indiana  University  Bloomington,  new  U.S.  investment  flows  in
companies headquartered in mainland China, Hong Kong, or Macau
peaked  in  2018  at  just  under  $190  billion—a  figure  considerably
higher  than  official  statistics.222  Investment  volumes  have  declined
every year since 2021. In 2023, U.S. non-greenfield investment flow
to  China  was  30  percent  of  its  2021  value,  or  slightly  below  $40
billion.223

While  the  absence  of  detailed,  official  U.S.  data  means  it  is  im-
possible  to  get  a  complete  picture  of  U.S.  direct  investment  into
China, alternative data providers suggest U.S. investors continue to
make  meaningful  contributions  to  technology  sectors  at  the  heart
of  U.S.-China  strategic  competition. The  United  States  remains  the
primary  global  investor  in  these  sectors  and  the  deals  U.S.  firms
make  can  generate  national  security  concerns  if  U.S.  investors  pro-
vide  capital  and  expertise  that  help  China  advance  its  capabilities
in sensitive technologies.224

* Pitchbook, for example, relies on systematic  web  crawling and is therefore unable to capture
investments  that  have  not  been  reported  in  regulatory  filings,  news  articles,  or  press  releases.
Michael R. Ryan, “Pitchbook Database,” Texas Tech University Innovation Hub at Research Park.
† Calculations by Sarah Bauerle Danzman suggest the overwhelming majority of U.S. direct in-
vestment flows to China fall under these categories. Dr. Danzman finds U.S. investment through
mergers  and  acquisitions,  private  equity,  and  venture  capital  was  about  three  times  as  large  as
global greenfield foreign direct investment to China in 2022, with VC investment making up the
largest  portion.  Sarah  Bauerle  Danzman,  statement  for  the  record  for  U.S.-China  Economic  and

436

U.S.  non-greenfield  investment  in  strategic  sectors  such  as  semi-
conductors,  quantum  computing,  and  AI  is  a  fraction  of  U.S.  total
investment  to  China  and  is  almost  exclusively  undertaken  by  ven-
ture  capital  (VC)  firms.* 225  U.S.  investment  flows  in  semiconduc-
tors,  quantum  computing,  and  AI  peaked  in  2020  at  nearly  $17
billion  before  plummeting  to  around  $2  billion  in  2023,  though  as
discussed  below  they  grew  in  2024.226  Among  those  sectors,  U.S.
investment  is  heavily  concentrated  in  the  semiconductor  industry,
which accounted for over 90 percent of total U.S. investment in Chi-
na’s semiconductors, quantum computing, and AI sectors in 2020.227
U.S.  investors  have  also  been  historically  very  involved  with  the
Chinese  AI  industry.  An  analysis  by  the  Center  for  Security  and
Emerging Technology (CSET) found that from 2015 to 2021, U.S. in-
vestors accounted for 37 percent of the $110 billion in global funding
raised by Chinese AI firms.† 228

The  United  States  is  the  most  important  foreign  source  of  in-
vestment  to  semiconductors,  quantum  computing,  and AI  in  Chi-
na.229  U.S.  investors  consistently  contribute  more  than  double
the  capital  to  these  sectors  compared  with  all  non-U.S.  investors
combined. Despite increased government interest in an outbound
investment  regime,  U.S.  investors  remain  keenly  interested  in
supporting  and  investing  in  China’s  semiconductors,  quantum
computing, and AI sectors.230 In the first half of 2024, U.S. direct
investment in those sectors had already surpassed the total value
of  2023.231

Private  sector  data  sources  do  not  provide  estimates  of  the  total

allocation of U.S. portfolio investments in China by sector.232

Impact of Restricting U.S. Direct and Portfolio Investment

Restricting  U.S.  direct  or  portfolio  investment  would  have  differ-
ent  impacts  on  China’s  innovation  ecosystem.  Halting  the  flow  of
direct  investment  to  specific  sectors  within  the  Chinese  economy
would diminish certain companies’ access to funding and the intan-
gible  benefits  often  associated  with  venture  capital  firms  and  ear-
ly-stage investors.233

Direct  investment  often  involves  a  long-term  relationship  that
gives  control  over  or  a  significant  degree  of  influence  on  the  man-
agement  of  an  enterprise.  Historically,  China  has  enforced  strin-
gent  restrictions  on  direct  investment  flows  into  the  country  and
has  forced  U.S.  and  other  foreign  businesses  to  acquiesce  to  joint
ventures  with  Chinese  firms  and  sign  over  their  IP  and  technology
to access the Chinese market.234 Because of the strategic nature of
the  investment,  in  addition  to  providing  capital  or  technology,  U.S.
investors  often  also  provide  intangible  benefits  to  recipient  compa-
nies, including an enhanced global reputation, managerial expertise,
talent  networks,  a  deep  understanding  of  technology,  and  U.S.  mar-
ket access.235

* In calculating investment size, Dr. Danzman specifically defines these sectors to include semi-
conductors, edge computing semiconductors, generative AI, post-quantum cryptography, quantum
computing, quantum sensing, and swarm AI.

† CSET  researchers  used  Crunchbase  as  their  data  source  instead  of  Pitchbook,  which  is  the
source  of  the  other  non-greenfield  investment  statistics  referenced  earlier.  Without  an  official
source, and because private sector sources have to rely on inherently incomplete collection meth-
ods  such  as  web  scraping,  there  may  be  some  minor  divergences  in  the  data  provided  by  both
sources.

437

Intangible  benefits  can  be  especially  meaningful  for  companies
in  the  startup  or  early  growth  phase. When  working  with  founders
who are often young and inexperienced, intangible  benefits such as
how to manage complex supply chains, maintain a skilled workforce,
and develop commercial strategies can be critical in determining the
success or failure of young technology companies.236

The  scale  of  U.S.  passive  investments  into  China  has  also  gener-
ated national security concerns. The relative ease at which transac-
tions  can  happen  mean  the  value  of  U.S.  portfolio  investment  stock
in  China  was  far  larger  than  the  value  of  U.S.  direct  investment
stock.* 237 Such massive differences in magnitude can help offset the
lack  of  intangible  benefits  offered.238  Abundant  U.S.  equity  invest-
ments in Chinese markets can help Chinese companies by reducing
their costs of capital, allowing them to acquire other businesses with
company  stock,  and  attracting  and  compensating  top  talent  with
company stock and stock options.239

As  of  2022,  U.S.  portfolio  holdings  of  equity  made  up  5.3  percent
of China’s domestic market capitalization.† United States firms are
likely  the  largest  foreign  holder  of  Chinese  equities.‡ 240 Therefore,
while  nothing  blocks  other  foreign  capital  from  backfilling  any  lost
U.S. equity investments, the relative scarcity of global capital, com-
bined  with  the  weak  performance  of  Chinese  equity  markets  in  re-
cent  years,  may  mean  there  are  insufficient  alternative  sources  to
fully  make  up  for  U.S.  portfolio  investments.  The  United  States  is
by  far  the  largest  global  investor,  making  up  25.5  percent  of  total
foreign portfolio investments as of December 2023.241 Including the
United  States’  G7  allies,  which  are  also  considering  an  outbound
investment  screening  mechanism,  this  share  jumps  to  72.2  percent
of  global  foreign  equity  investments  (as  of  December  2023,  the  G7
makes up 48 percent of foreign holdings in the Chinese equity mar-
ket and 59.3 percent of the Hong Kong equity market).§ 242 This sig-

* In 2022, the official value of U.S. portfolio investment stock was 435 percent of direct invest-
ment  ($910  billion  in  portfolio  investment  stock  and  $209  billion  in  direct  investment  stock).
However,  limitations  in  official  data  collection  of  U.S.  direct  investment  likely  mean  the  true
percentage  could  be  different.  Carol  C.  Bertaut,  Beau  Bressler,  and  Stephanie  Curcuru, “Global-
ization  and  the  Geography  of  Capital  Flows,”  Board  of  Governors  of  the  Federal  Reserve  System

† This calculation was done by dividing the Federal Reserve’s estimate for U.S. holdings of Chi-
nese  and  Hong  Kong  securities  by  their  respective  stock  market  capitalization  (China  at  $11.47
trillion  and  Hong  Kong  at  $4.57  trillion).  World  Bank  Group,  “Market  Capitalization  of  Listed

‡ Based on the Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS), a voluntary data collection ex-
ercise conducted under the auspices of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the United States
is  the  largest  foreign  holder  of  Chinese  and  Hong  Kong  equities  with  nearly  double  the  assets
of  the  next-largest  foreign  holder,  Singapore.  Importantly,  however,  the  CPIS  dataset  is  reliant
on  national  sources  to  build  these  data. As  a  result,  the  IMF  reports  2022  U.S.  equity  holdings
in  China  and  Hong  Kong  as  $367  billion,  which  is  derived  from  Treasury  Department  data  on
residency. This  is  far  lower  than  the  Fed’s  nationality-adjusted  value  of  $860  billion. While  this
adjustment could mean U.S. investors are by far the largest and most important foreign investor
in  Chinese  equities,  contributing  four  times  as  much  capital  as  Singapore,  the  prevalence  of  tax
havens  and  the  imprecision  of  investment  data  likely  indicate  that  other  countries’  total  assets
are underreported as well. International Monetary Fund, “Coordinated Portfolio Investment Sur-
vey–Derived  Portfolio  Investment  Liabilities  (All  Economies)  by  Economy  of  Nonresident  Holder:

ket and Hong Kong as a foreign investor of the mainland China equity market. The calculations
exclude China and Hong Kong, respectively, as a foreign investor.

nificant share of assets means that if the G7 eventually implements
outbound  investment  restrictions  on  portfolio  investment  across  all
its  member  economies,  it  could  significantly  impact  Chinese  public
companies’  access  to  capital  and  reduce  their  ability  to  compensate
talent or conduct mergers and acquisitions.243

Ongoing Efforts to Regulate Outbound Investment Screening

Ongoing  U.S.  investment  into  China  raises  concerns  that  remain
unaddressed by existing U.S. authorities. CFIUS screens many types
of investments into the United States for national security risks, but
not  outbound  flows.  Export  controls  can  mitigate  the  risk  from  the
transfer  of  sensitive  U.S.  technologies  and  prohibit  such  transfers
as part of an investment or via R&D collaboration,  but they  do not
cover  other  risks  that  arise  from  capital  investments,  particularly
VC/FDI. Policymakers have been engaged in an active debate about
whether  to  create  an  outbound  investment  screening  mechanism,
how  broad  to  scope  it  both  in  terms  of  the  sectors  and  the  types  of
investment to be covered, and otherwise how best to structure such
a  system  to  achieve  the  desired  policy  goals  but  not  interfere  with
status of the United States as the premier global financial center. In
August 2023, the White House issued an EO directing the Treasury
Department  to  create  an  outbound  investment  review  regime,  and
debates in Congress continue.*

Implications for the United States

Economic  statecraft  has  become  the  United  States’  tool  of  first
resort  in  addressing  the  threats  China  poses  to  key  U.S.  interests.
Policymakers in Washington have turned to trade measures, export
controls  and  sanctions,  and  foreign  investment  reviews  to  address
longstanding  concerns  about  Chinese  non-market  practices,  forced
technology  transfer,  civil-military  fusion,  Chinese  technological  and
military  modernization,  and  the  specter  of  military  confrontation.
Some of these tools have not been used at scale in a generation. As a
result, the use of each needs to be reviewed regularly to ensure each
is  addressing  the  unique  challenges  posed  by  the  Chinese  economy
and its system at large.

How  the  United  States  coordinates  and  communicates  its  trade
policy  will  play  a  central  role  in  effectively  wielding  trade  instru-
ments  to  promote  resilient  and  fair  economic  relations  with  China.
Since 2017, the United States has more aggressively utilized a broad-
er range of trade authorities. However, these tariffs and other trade
tools—as blunt yet powerful instruments—have led to wide-ranging
effects on the U.S. economy, promoting trade and supply chain objec-
tives in some areas while imposing costs in others. The effectiveness
of  these  trade  policies  can  be  enhanced  through  better  calibration
of  the  policy  mix.  China’s  surging  manufacturing  capacity  and  ex-
ports  in  2024  and  its  efforts  to  develop  national  champions  in  key
technology areas further underlie the need for a dynamic and stra-
tegic  approach  to  counter  China’s  unfair  trade  practices. Above  all,
a comprehensive and coherent trade policy must start by addressing

Investment Security Program.”

439

unresolved  questions  about  U.S.  goals  and  articulating  a  vision  of
the desired future U.S.-China economic relationship.

The United States has led a number of key allies to introduce ex-
port controls on strategic technologies, most notably semiconductors
and semiconductor manufacturing equipment. Through an iterative
and collaborative process, the United States has demonstrated both
the  national  security  necessity  for  export  controls  and  that  export
controls  can  effectively  slow  the  technological  advancement  of  ad-
versarial  nations.  The  United  States  should  continue  to  anticipate
rapid  development  in  these  areas,  requiring  constant  recalibration
and coordination with allies and partners on what constitutes a cut-
ting-edge  technology.  Simultaneously,  the  United  States  should  not
lose sight of legacy chips. Chinese dominance of legacy chip produc-
tion  could  create  new  risks  for  U.S.  commercial  supply  chains  and
military  procurement.  (For  more  on  U.S.-China  technology  competi-
tion,  see  Chapter  3, “U.S.-China  Competition  in  Emerging Technol-
ogies.”)

Debate  continues  around  the  desirability  of  an  outbound  invest-
ment  mechanism  and  how  it  should  be  designed  and  implemented.
Broad  bipartisan  consensus  calls  for  a  new  tool  to  stem  the  flow  of
capital  and  nontangible  know-how  from  the  United  States’  preemi-
nent firms into advanced Chinese technology companies. The August
2023 outbound investment EO is a starting point. However, a dura-
ble mechanism will likely need to be founded in legislation. A num-
ber  of  debates  around  its  scope  also  remain,  including  the  types  of
investments that should be prohibited. A further challenge in shap-
ing the mechanism is the lack of data around U.S. investments into
China. The pervasive use of offshore tax havens and an inability to
access  granular,  sectoral  data  mean  policymakers  are  flying  blind
when determining the scale and scope of investment prohibitions.

However, the size and salience of China mean that no single U.S.
economic  statecraft  tool  will  be  a  panacea  for  the  challenges  its
economy  poses. Trade  measures,  export  controls  and  sanctions,  and
investment  restrictions  will  need  to  work  in  tandem  to  achieve  the
United States’ most ambitious and important goals. This means that
the  policy  work  cannot  end  when  each  tool  is  adopted  and  stream-
lined to address the issues in its specific domain. U.S officials must
continuously  dismantle  bureaucratic  siloes  and  compel  implement-
ing agencies to work toward a unified strategy.

Appendix  II:  Executive  Order  on  an  Outbound
Investment  Security  Program
On August 9, 2023, in response to worsening relations and the con-
tinued flow of U.S. investment into key Chinese technology sectors, the
White  House  issued  an  EO,  “Addressing  United  States  Investments
in  Certain  National  Security  Technologies  and  Products  in  Countries
of  Concern,”  establishing  an  outbound  investment  regime.245  The  EO
takes a sectoral approach focusing on U.S. investments in China across
a  narrow  set  of  technologies  related  to  semiconductors  and  microelec-
tronics, quantum information technologies, and AI systems.246 The EO
is rooted in the authority granted to the president by the International
Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA).* 247

Shortly  after  the  EO  was  released,  the  Treasury  Department  is-
sued  an  Advance  Notice  of  Proposed  Rulemaking  (ANPRM)  that
outlined the proposed outbound investment regime and sought pub-
lic  comments.248  In  July  2024,  the  ANPRM  was  followed  up  with
a  Notice  of  Proposed  Rulemaking  (NPRM),  which  detailed  the  Ad-
ministration’s current thinking on how to design and implement an
outbound investment mechanism.† 249

The  program  aims  to  limit  investment  by  U.S.  persons ‡  in  Chi-
nese entities that are involved in—or in certain circumstances may
become involved in—the development or production of covered tech-
nologies.§  It  would  do  this  by  proposing  two  categories  of  concern
for  outbound  direct  investments:  notifiable  transactions  that  could
contribute to a national security threat and prohibited transactions

* IEEPA  grants  the  president  sweeping  authority  to “nullify,  void,  prevent,  or  prohibit”  trans-
actions, 50 U.S.C. § 1702(a)(1)(B), in response to “any unusual and extraordinary threat . . . to the
national security, foreign policy, or economy of the United States,” 50 U.S.C. § 1701(a).

† While the ANPRM and the NPRM are very similar they do have a few important differences.
The  definition  of  AI  was  harmonized  to  align  with  other  EOs  such  as  EO  14110.  The  NPRM
elaborates on and refines some ambiguities around the knowledge standard (which describes the
knowledge a U.S. person must have about certain facts and circumstances related to a transaction
to trigger obligations under the proposed rule); clarifies applicability in very specific transactions
types;  provides  a  new  exception  for  transactions  involving  persons  of  third  countries  that  have
similar  measures  aimed  at  outbound  investments;  and  clarifies  the  scope  of  limited  partner  in-
vestments  that  would  be  covered  by  the  proposed  rule  and  those  that  would  be  excepted.  U.S.
Department  of  the Treasury,  Office  of  Investment  Security,  FACT  SHEET: Treasury  Department
Issues  Notice  of  Proposed  Rulemaking  on  Implementation  of  Outbound  Investment  Executive  Or-
der (E.O. 14105), June 21, 2024.

‡ The EO and NPRM impose compliance obligations on “U.S. persons,” defined as a U.S. citizen
or  lawful  permanent  resident,  as  well  as  any  entity  organized  under  the  United  States  or  any
jurisdiction  within  the  United  States,  including  those  entities’  foreign  subsidiaries.  Notably,  the
non-U.S.  entity  also  falls  under  the  jurisdiction  of  the  mechanism  if  it  has  a  majority  owner,
general  partner,  or  investment  adviser  to  a  pooled  investment  fund  that  falls  under  the  defini-
tion  of  a  U.S.  person.  Similar  to  economic  sanctions,  the  rules  would  also  prohibit  a  U.S.  person
from  making  or  substantially  participating  in  transactions  on  behalf  of  a  non-U.S.  person  that
would  be  prohibited  if  undertaken  by  a  U.S.  person.  U.S.  Department  of  the  Treasury,  “Provi-
sions  Pertaining  to  U.S.  Investments  in  Certain  National  Security Technologies  and  Products  in
Countries of Concern,” Federal Register 89:129 (July 5, 2024); Antonia I. Tzinova et al., “Treasury
Department  Issues  Long-Awaited  Proposed  Rule  on  Outbound  Investment  Screening,”  Holland
& Knight, June 26, 2024; U.S. Department of the Treasury, “Provisions Pertaining to U.S. Invest-
ments in Certain National Security Technologies and Products in Countries of Concern,” Federal
Register 89:129 (July 5, 2024).

§ The  NPRM  defines  this  as “covered  transactions,”  which  happen  when  a “U.S.  person”  trans-
acts  with  a  “covered  foreign  person.”  A  “covered  foreign  person”  is  defined  as  a  “person  of  a
country  of  concern”  that  engages  in  activity  related  to  the  technologies  specified  as  notifiable  or
prohibited  in  the  proposed  regulations. “Person  of  a  country  of  concern”  covers  any  entity  head-
quartered in, with a principal place of business in, or organized in the People’s Republic of China,
Hong  Kong,  and  Macau  (China);  an  individual  who  is  a  citizen  or  permanent  resident  of  China;
or  an  entity  that  is  directly  or  indirectly  majority-owned  by  a  Chinese  person.  U.S.  Department

ogies and Products in Countries of Concern,” Federal Register 89:129 (July 5, 2024).

that “pose  a  particularly  acute  national  security  threat”  because  of
their  potential  to  significantly  advance  the  “military,  intelligence,
surveillance,  or  cyber-enabled  capabilities”  of  countries  of  con-
cern.250 However, any notifiable transaction would be automatically
prohibited if the Chinese entity party to the transaction is listed on
any  one  of  several  U.S.  government  lists  primarily  used  for  export
controls  and  sanctions,  including  the  Entity  List  and  the  Specially
Designated Nationals (SDN) list.251

Unlike  CFIUS,  the  outbound  investment  program  would  not  op-
erate  through  a  case-by-case  review  or  preapproval  requirement.
Violations  would  be  retroactively  enforced  though  civil  and  crimi-
nal  penalties.252 While  the Administration’s  approach  to  prohibited
transactions is consistent with its “small yard, high fence” strategy,
the  regime’s  notification  requirements  are  far  broader  and  are  in-
tended  to  fill  in  critical  gaps  regarding  the  United  States’  under-
standing of the nature and scale of domestic investments in Chinese
high-tech  sectors.  (For  more,  see  “Limitations  of  Official  U.S.  Data
Sources on Outbound Investment” in this chapter.) 253

The  Administration’s  program  specifically  covers  active  invest-
ments, sometimes called “smart money,” including the acquisition of
equity  interests  (mergers  and  acquisitions,  private  equity,  and VC),
contingent  equity  interests,  greenfield  investments,  joint  ventures,
and  equity-convertible  debt  financing.254  It  notably  carves  out  pas-
sive investments such as publicly traded securities; securities issued
by  an  investment  company,  like  an  index  fund,  mutual  fund,  or  ex-
change traded fund; and pooled investment funds.* 255

* Treasury is still finalizing its approach to investments in pooled funds and has proposed two
approaches.  The  first  exempts  them  so  long  as  the  U.S.  investor’s  rights  are  consistent  with  a
passive investment and their capital is not more than 50 percent of the total assets under man-
agement. The  second  caps  their  investment  at  $1  million.  Janet  K.  Kim,  Sylwia A.  Lis,  and  Rob

CHAPTER 7: CHINA’S NEW MEASURES FOR
CONTROL, MOBILIZATION, AND RESILIENCE

Abstract

After  a  long  period  of  “peace  and  development”  during  which
Chinese  Communist  Party  (CCP)  leaders  felt  the  international
environment  was  conducive  to  China’s  economic  development,
growing  power,  and  international  influence,  the  views  of  Chi-
na’s  leadership  have  changed.  General  Secretary  of  the  CCP  Xi
Jinping  now  believes  China  has  entered  a  period  of  increased
challenges  both  domestically  and  internationally  and  has  taken
a  number  of  steps  to  better  prepare  the  Party  and  country  for
this  period  of  threat  and  uncertainty.  On  the  political  front,  Chi-
nese  leaders  have  broadened  conceptions  of  national  security  to
enhance  the  Party-state’s  power,  build  out  the  national  security
state,  and  expand  tools  of  societal  control  at  the  grassroots  lev-
el.  On  the  military  front,  China’s  armed  forces  have  improved
their  mechanisms  for  mobilizing  available  manpower,  leveraging
resources in the civilian economy, and priming the Chinese public
to  contribute  to  national  defense.  On  the  economic  front,  China
has  implemented  measures  to  strengthen  food  security,  energy
security,  and  trade  and  financial  security.

China’s numerous and varied actions are driven by multiple goals,
including  the  desire  to  suppress  domestic  challenges,  prepare  for  a
more volatile and less open international economic environment, and
position  itself  effectively  for  long-term  strategic  competition  with
the  United  States.  At  the  same  time,  many  of  these  actions  serve
to  increase  China’s  capacity  for  rapid  military  mobilization  and  re-
silience  in  the  case  of  hostilities.  Recent  changes  have  made  China
significantly more prepared for war compared to five years ago while
potentially  obscuring  the  signals  that  would  normally  precede  an
imminent  or  near-term  mobilization.  These  changes  have  already
altered  the  strategic  and  operational  environment  in  China’s  favor.
Chinese  officials  likely  believe  they  have  moderated  the  economic
costs the United States and its allies could impose on them through
sanctions, blockades, and trade restrictions in the event there is an
outbreak  of  hostilities,  potentially  reducing  the  deterrent  effect  of
non-military policy options and external constraints.

Key Findings

 • China’s  leaders  believe  they  have  entered  a  new  historical
phase  characterized  by  greater  internal  and  external  threats.
This  heightened  threat  perception  has  fueled  numerous  poli-
cy  efforts  to  better  prepare  the  Party,  China’s  society,  and  the
military  for  what  the  Party  believes  will  be  a  more  hostile  and
uncertain period.

(458)

459

 • China’s  leaders  have  intensified  their  rhetoric  about  risk  over
the  last  few  years,  increasingly  invoking  a  concept  called  “ex-
treme  scenario  thinking”  that  suggests  Chinese  policymakers
are increasingly thinking through the potential ramifications of
a  wide  range  of  scenarios,  including  the  repercussions  of  ac-
tions they might initiate on the international stage. At the same
time,  CCP  rhetoric  toward  Taiwan  and  the  United  States  has
not  escalated  to  the  degree  that  preceded  China’s  conflicts  in
past  decades  or  to  what  some  experts  expect  to  see  if  China
were imminently preparing for war.

 • China  is  continuing  longstanding  efforts  to  address  concerns
over  food  insecurity.  China  is  largely  self-sufficient  in  four  of
five  key  staples,  though  it  is  becoming  increasingly  dependent
on corn and wheat imports. China relies on imports for the fifth
(soybeans)  and  is  overall  a  significant  net  food  importer.  China
is  believed  to  have  the  world’s  largest  stockpiles  of  its  key  sta-
ples  and  has  taken  measures  to  diversify  its  soybean  supplies
away  from  the  United  States  and  reduce  overall  soybean  con-
sumption.

 • China  is  taking  measures  to  enhance  its  energy  security  and
to ensure it can address its oil energy needs for long periods of
time without imports. China is largely self-sufficient in coal, its
primary  energy  source  for  power  generation,  and  it  has  devel-
oped  a  coal  surge  capacity  to  deal  with  temporary  disruptions.
Perhaps because natural gas is not a major part of China’s en-
ergy mix, China seems less concerned about its significant reli-
ance on imports and only has a short-term stockpile of natural
gas.  China  is  heavily  dependent  on  oil  imports  for  transporta-
tion  and  appears  to  be  building  very  large  stockpiles—with  es-
timates of one to two years’ supply.

 • China is taking measures to enhance its financial security, chal-
lenge  global  dollar  dominance,  and  protect  itself  from  U.S.  fi-
nancial sanctions by creating alternatives to dollar-based trade
and the U.S.-controlled financial payments system. These efforts
have  accelerated  since  the  imposition  of  sanctions  in  the  wake
of  Russia’s  war  of  aggression  against  Ukraine.  While  the  ren-
minbi (RMB) is not on pace to supplant the U.S. dollar as a me-
dium  of  global  exchange,  China  is  developing  these  tools  with
the intention to insulate itself from many types of U.S. financial
sanctions.

 • Party  leaders  have  developed  an  exceedingly  broad  concep-
tion  of  national  security  and  expanded  their  tools  for  domes-
tic  control. These  include  an  increasingly  robust  internal  se-
curity  apparatus,  the  revival  of  some  Maoist-era  methods  of
mass  mobilization,  and  efforts  to  leverage  the  public  for  sur-
veillance  and  control,  including  by  outsourcing  public  secu-
rity  tasks  to  government-sanctioned  “vigilante  groups.”  This
heightened  focus  on  security  has  been  formalized  through
an  expansion  of  relevant  legal  infrastructure,  with  new  laws
defining  national  security  as  touching  upon  virtually  every
aspect  of  society.

460

 • There  is  currently  no  evidence  that  China  is  preparing  for  an
imminent  war,  but  the  various  reforms  China  has  made  to  its
defense mobilization system over time undeniably make it more
confident and prepared for hostilities than it was five years ago.
Many  of  these  measures  reduce  the  time  needed  for  China  to
mobilize  and  transition  from  peacetime  or  gray  zone  activities
to  active  hostilities  and  could  be  read  as  efforts  to  prepare  the
operational  environment  for  a  conflict  over  Taiwan.  Given  the
decreasing  amount  of  open  source  data  available  about  China,
the  United  States  and  international  observers  will  have  less
visibility  of  warnings  and  indicators  that  may  presage  Chinese
military  action,  a  shorter  timeline  to  react  once  indicators  are
discovered, and fewer non-military tools to respond.

Recommendations
The Commission recommends:

 • Congress  direct  the  Office  of  the  Director  of  National  Intelli-
gence,  within  180  days,  to  conduct  a  classified  assessment,  and
brief  its  findings  to  Congress,  of  the  intelligence  community’s
(IC)  ability  to  accurately  monitor  strategic,  nonmilitary  indica-
tors  that  would  signal  that  China  is  preparing  for  imminent
conflict and the extent to which China’s increasing lack of trans-
parency affects the IC’s ability to monitor this information. The
assessment should include, but not be limited to, the following:
 ○ The IC’s ability to monitor:

  China’s energy storage locations and stockpiling rates, par-

ticularly for crude oil, coal, and natural gas;

  Production shifts from civilian to military industries;
  China’s national defense mobilization system; and
  China’s  strategic  reserves  and  their  compositions  and  lo-

cations;

 ○ The IC’s ability to coordinate with non-Title 10 and -Title 50
federal  agencies  that  have  technical  expertise  in  agriculture
and trade to monitor China’s food and energy stockpiling and
any  derived  indicators  that  may  signal  a  potential  prepara-
tion for conflict;

 ○ Whether  the  IC’s  current  geospatial  intelligence  posture  is
adequate  to  compensate  for  the  loss  of  open  source  informa-
tion from China; and

 ○ The  desirability  and  feasibility  of  establishing  an  Energy
Strategic Warning system involving coordination between rel-
evant  entities  including  the  National  Geospatial-Intelligence
Agency and the U.S. Departments of Energy, Commerce, State,
and the Treasury.

Introduction

In 2022, protestors in China chanted “Xi Jinping, step down!” and
“Communist Party, step down!” as the most significant public expres-
sions of discontent in decades spread from Shanghai to cities across

461

China.1 Though quickly repressed, such daring chants and  protests
suggest that the CCP, despite its relentless efforts, has not been able
to entirely suppress dissent toward the Party-state. Likewise, China
has exhausted the patience of major economies and trading partners
who are no longer willing to endure its economic predation or ignore
its  aggression  and  security  threats. Thus,  China  faces  a  new  era  of
risks that the Party’s own policies have brought about.

This  chapter  examines  some  of  China’s  key  responses  to  its  per-
ceptions  of  intensifying  domestic  and  international  risks.  It  will
first  investigate  China’s  efforts  to  improve  economic  resilience  in
its  food,  energy,  and  financial  infrastructure.  It  will  then  examine
recent changes in Chinese leaders’ assessment of their environment
and survey the Party-state’s efforts to enhance political control over
China’s institutions and society. Finally, it will assess recent efforts
to  improve  the  capacity  of  China’s  armed  forces  and  society  to  rap-
idly  mobilize  for  a  conflict,  before  considering  implications  for  the
United States. This chapter is based on the Commission’s June 2024
hearing on “China’s Stockpiling and Mobilization Measures for Com-
petition  and  Conflict,”  consultations  with  experts,  and  open  source
research and analysis.

Chinese Leaders Worry about Interlocked Internal

and External Risks

In  the  past  several  years,  China’s  leadership  has  assessed  that
they  have  entered  a  period  of  greater  security  challenges  and  in-
ternal and external risks. General Secretary Xi’s speech and accom-
panying  report  to  the  20th  Party  Congress  in  October  2022  struck
a  darker  tone  than  the  previous  one  in  2017,  emphasizing  rising
threats  and  calling  on  the  nation  to  “be  ready  to  withstand  high
winds, choppy waters, and even dangerous storms.” 2 Customary lan-
guage about China’s “period of strategic opportunity” and “peace and
development” as “the theme of the times” was dropped from the po-
litical report, which instead stated that strategic opportunities were
now concurrent with risks and challenges.* 3 In a speech to the Cen-
tral  National  Security  Commission  in  May  2023,  Xi  continued  this
intensified rhetoric, describing the national security environment as
“complex and severe.” 4

The  language  in  senior  leadership’s  speeches  has  also  become
increasingly  confrontational.  In  a  speech  to  representatives  from
the  commercial  sector  during  the  annual  “two  sessions”  in  March
2023,  Xi  plainly  stated  that “Western  countries—led  by  the  United
States—have implemented all-round containment, encirclement and
suppression against us, bringing unprecedentedly severe challenges
to  our  country’s  development.” † 5  Xi  has  also  increasingly  exhorted

* The concept of the period of strategic opportunity was introduced by Jiang Zemin at the 16th Par-
ty Congress in 2002, characterizing the first two decades of the 21st century as presenting a peaceful
external  environment  and  stable  domestic  situation  that  would  allow  China  to  concentrate  on  eco-
nomic growth and development, building on Deng Xiaoping’s statement that “peace and development
are the theme of the times.” Center for Strategic Translation, “Peace and Development are the Theme
of the Times;” Center for Strategic Translation, “Period of Strategic Opportunity.”

† The  speech  was  given  to  delegates  of  the  Chinese  People’s  Political  Consultative  Conference
(CPPCC),  an  advisory  body,  from  the  All-China  Federation  of  Industry  and  Commerce  and  the
China National Democratic Construction Association, during the March 2023 “two sessions,” an-
nual  plenary  sessions  of  the  National  People’s  Congress  and  of  the  Chinese  People’s  Political

Party officials and the public to endure hardship and “dare to strug-
gle.” 6  Xi  uses  the  Maoist  phrase  far  more  frequently  than  his  pre-
decessors, often when exhorting Party members to endure adversity
and  strive  to  achieve  Party  goals;  it  was  inserted  additional  times
into the Party Charter after the 20th Party Congress.7

Finally,  China’s  leaders  have  begun  to  insist  that  Party  cadres
must  be  prepared  for “extreme”  and “worst-case”  scenarios.  Xi  first
mentioned  “extreme  scenario  thinking”  alongside  “worst-case  sce-
nario  thinking”  at  the  May  2023  meeting  of  the  Central  Nation-
al  Security  Commission.* 8  The  two  terms  refer  to  methodologies
Party  cadres  can  supposedly  use  to  “plan  for  worst-case  scenarios,
and encourage adopting proactive measures.” 9 According to the tes-
timony  of  Manoj  Kewalramani,  Chair  of  the  Indo-Pacific  Research
Programme  and  China  Studies  Fellow  at  the  Takshashila  Institu-
tion, “extreme  scenario  thinking”  enables  understanding  of  feasible
actions  in  unpredictable  crisis  situations  by  imagining  the  greatest
level  of  severity  that  might  occur  in  a  given  scenario.  In  contrast,
“bottom  line  thinking”  refers  to  setting  minimum  standards  or  red
lines  that  cannot  be  breached,  and  making  preparation  to  prevent
predictable challenges.10 Mr. Kewalramani pointed out that extreme
scenario thinking could be used by Chinese strategists when consid-
ering the repercussions of proactive behavior, which could plausibly
include a Chinese decision to attack Taiwan.11

Comprehensive National Security Concept Underpins
Stronger National Security State

The  “Comprehensive  National  Security  Concept”  forms  the
ideological basis for the subordination of all aspects of governance
to  national  security.  First  outlined  in  a  2014  speech  by  Xi,  it  ex-
pands the concept of national security beyond traditional military
threats  and  territorial  integrity  to  nontraditional  threats  to  re-
gime survival, emphasizing the connection between domestic and
foreign threats.12 The initial concept laid out 11 types of security:
political, military, territorial, economic, cultural, social, technolog-
ical,  information,  ecological,  resource,  and  nuclear.13  Additional
types  were  added  over  the  years,  and  the  concept  now  encom-
passes 20 types, including food, finance, overseas interests, space,
deep sea, polar regions, biological, artificial intelligence, and data
security.14  Political  security,  however,  is  the  most  important  task
and is defined as safeguarding the leadership and governing sta-
tus of the Party.15 Economic growth and the risks  created  by ex-
cessive  debt  and  other  issues  are  significant  aspects  of  the  con-
cept  because  the  economy  continues  to  serve  as  a  key  source  of
the CCP’s legitimacy—and therefore its political security.16 While
economic  and  financial  security  are  encompassed  by  the  Com-
prehensive  National  Security  Concept,  the  CCP  is  increasingly
willing  to  accept  potential  economic  costs  in  order  to  prioritize
political security.17

Assessing the Party-State’s Activity: New Measures

for Control, Mobilization, and Resilience

The  CCP  has  undertaken  robust  measures  over  the  past  decade
to enhance its control, resilience, and capacity to mobilize resources
in the economic, political, and military domains. While Chinese lead-
ers’ motivations for undertaking them remain unclear, taken collec-
tively, the measures unquestionably make China better prepared to
cope with a variety of domestic and foreign challenges.

Economic Preparedness

Chinese  leaders’  growing  threat  perceptions  and  concerns  about
the  need  to  prepare  for  a  more  hostile  international  environment
are increasingly reflected in their economic policies. This section fo-
cuses  on  China’s  efforts  to  enhance  food,  energy,  and  financial  se-
curity  through  stockpiling  and  other  policies  designed  to  improve
resilience,  withstand  temporary  shocks,  and  weather  more  pro-
longed  challenges.  The  inherent  dual-use  nature  of  Chinese  eco-
nomic  preparations  for  a  crisis  make  them  complicated  indicators
of  China’s  intentions  or  future  action.*  Chinese  efforts  to  improve
food and energy self-sufficiency and stockpile resources could be in-
terpreted  as  a  way  to  build  resilience  against  a  U.S.  blockade  in  a
Taiwan crisis. However, those same actions could also be a response
to  the  country’s  widespread  famines  throughout  the  20th  century
and energy crises that have affected certain provinces as recently as
2021.18  Similarly,  Chinese  efforts  to  internationalize  the  RMB  and
develop  alternative  payments  systems  began  as  a  response  to  con-
tractions in global dollar liquidity in the aftermath of the 1997 Asia
financial  crisis  and  the  2008  global  financial  crisis.19  However,  the
same systems that can ensure Chinese firms and their trading part-
ners  have  ample  access  to  credit  and  exchange  during  a  recession
also  may  allow  China  to  insulate  its  financial  sector  and  external
trade from U.S. financial sanctions.

One  thing  is  clear:  the  Chinese  economy  is  more  prepared  today
for a crisis scenario—one catalyzed by confrontation with the United
States or another unpredictable event—than it was two decades ear-
lier when the country was first constructing its strategic petroleum
reserves and exploring RMB internationalization.20 Even if Chinese
motivations  are  entirely  domestic,  the  United  States  can  no  longer
rely on intertwined food supply chains, China’s profound dependence
on seaborne oil, and the blocking power of U.S. sanctions to enhance
deterrence as strongly as they may have done in the past.

Food Security in China

General Secretary Xi has continued China’s historic focus on food
security  by  prioritizing  efforts  to  increase  domestic  production,  di-
versify  supply  chains,  and  build  stockpiles.  For  centuries,  Chinese
food security has been inseparable from social stability.† China un-

* Dual-use  is  meant  here  to  reflect  that  these  preparations  are  both  typical  efforts  that  many
governments undertake to reduce risks and promote resilience as well as the types of efforts that
might be used to prepare for hostilities.

† During  the  Qing  Dynasty  (1644–1911),  China  experienced  major  famines  between  1810  to
1907  that  resulted  in  the  deaths  of  tens  of  millions. These  famines  were  often  the  catalysts  for
major rebellions or upheaval that diminished the government’s authority and worsened socioeco-
nomic  conditions.  These  periods  of  starvation  ultimately  contributed  to  the  dynasty’s  collapse.

464

der the CCP is no different. Well before the emergence of U.S.-China
great power competition, CCP leadership has been extremely sensi-
tive  about  maintaining  food  security.21 The  Great  Famine  in  1959–
1961,  China’s  last  calamitous  food  crisis,  is  the  largest  famine  in
human history and continues to inform Chinese food policy today.* 22
China  faces  structural  challenges  to  long-term  food  security.  Chi-
na must feed 21 percent of the world’s population on 8 percent of the
world’s  arable  land  and  6  percent  of  the  world’s  water  resources.23
Climate  change,  pollution,  and  rapid  urbanization  have  magnified
the  effects  of  China’s  shortage  of  arable  land.  Between  2013  and
2019,  destructive  farming  practices,  among  other  contributing  fac-
tors  like  the  conversion  of  agricultural  land  for  infrastructure  and
real  estate,  caused  a  more  than  5  percent  decline  in  China’s  culti-
vatable  land.24  What  remains  is  often  contaminated.  Researchers
estimate  that  10.2  percent  of  arable  soil  is  so  polluted  that  it  is  no
longer safe to grow products for consumption, and about 2.5 percent
of China’s farmland cannot be cultivated at all, mainly due to heavy
metal contamination.25 The country now has an estimated domestic
planting  area  shortage  of  90  million  hectares.† 26  As  a  result,  pro-
duction growth for rice, wheat, and corn has slowed down during the
last decade as land becomes increasingly unavailable.27

China  also  has  geographic  water  imbalances.  Eighty  percent  of
Chinese water resources are concentrated in southern provinces.‡ 28
This distribution is particularly damaging for food security. China’s
northern provinces account for 65 percent of the country’s cultivated
land  and  50  percent  of  the  country’s  grain  production.29  The  mis-
match  between  water  supply  and  use  means  that  the  north  of  the
country  could  run  dry  within  30  years.§ 30  Climate  change  is  exac-

* Working from official statistics, scholars have estimated that the famine, which was the result
of Chairman Mao’s efforts to accelerate industrialization by shifting resources away from agricul-
ture, led to the death of 30 million  people and another 33  million births were lost or postponed,
sowing  the  seed  for  the  deeply  tumultuous  Cultural  Revolution.  Shige  Song,  “Mortality  Conse-

† Beijing  is  taking  a  number  of  actions  to  try  and  rectify  this.  Central  Document  No.  1  from
2019 set out a “farmland red line” policy with a target of preserving at least 120 million hectares
of  farmland—an  area  slightly  larger  than  Sweden. The  National  High-Standard  Farmland  Con-
struction  Plan  (2021–2030)  has  also  implemented  a  national  plan  for  enhancement  of  farmland
quality through farmland restoration measures, crop rotation practices, and fallow land systems.
China has also purchased agricultural land beyond its borders. In 2021, Chinese investors owned
383,935  acres  of  agricultural  land  in  the  United  States,  though  more  recently  U.S.  officials  have
begun  to  curtail  this  practice.  The  lion’s  share  of  Chinese  international  land  purchases  are  in
Asia  and  Africa.  Between  2011  and  2020,  Chinese  companies  purchased  or  leased  6.48  million
hectares  of  land  for  agriculture,  forestry,  or  mining.  Gustavo  F.  C.  Ferreira,  written  testimony

‡ Mao  Zedong  acknowledged  this  70  years  ago  when  he  famously  remarked,  “The  South  has

try  away  from  water-stressed  regions,  and  is  investing  in  water  management  infrastructure.  In

erbating  this.  Researchers  estimate  that  a  combination  of  climate
change-related drought and heightened levels of tropospheric ozone
has  accounted  for  yield  losses  of  10  percent  in  China.31  Between
1981  and  2010,  this  amounted  to  annual  losses  of  55  million  tons
of crops.32

Chinese  demand  for  food  is  increasing.  From  1990  to  2019,  Chi-
nese  per  capita  food  available  for  consumption  increased  34  per-
cent.33  Rising  incomes  mean  this  growth  will  continue.  Between
2020 and 2050, researchers estimate that Chinese demand will grow
a  further  16  to  30  percent.34  Cheng  Guoqiang,  a  professor  of  ag-
ricultural  economics  and  rural  development  at  Renmin  University
in  Beijing,  estimates  that  rising  food  demand  and  challenges  from
climate  change  mean  national  food  output  will  likely  continue  to
decline  as  a  percentage  of  domestic  demand.  Professor  Cheng  esti-
mates  that  from  2000  to  2020,  China’s  reliance  on  imports  for  its
overall  food  supply  increased  from  6.4  percent  to  34.2  percent.35
He  projects  that  by  2030  imports  will  rise  by  another  7  percentage
points, with domestic production accounting for just 58.8 percent of
China’s total demand.36

Informed  by  their  past  and  aware  of  present  challenges,  Chinese
leaders  have  persistently  prioritized  food  security  as  a  prerequisite  to
maintaining power.37 In many ways, these policies have been success-
ful for the time being. Grains are at the heart of China’s food security
efforts.  They  are  the  country’s  main  source  of  calories,  animal  feed,
and  raw  materials  for  processed  food  products.38  Since  1996,  China
has  aimed  to  maintain  95  percent  self-sufficiency  for  its  key  grains.39
Though  Chinese  production  has  fallen  below  the  95  percent  target,  it
is still largely self-sufficient in corn, rice, and wheat.¶ 40

Corn: China is the second-largest corn producer in the world and
is  mostly  self-sufficient  in  the  crop.41  Corn  is  China’s  largest  food
crop in terms of production. In the 2023 marketing year,† China pro-
duced 288.8 million metric tons of corn domestically.42 China is also
the world’s largest corn importer, and in 2023 it imported 26.2 mil-
lion metric tons, primarily from Brazil (11.9 million metric tons), the
United States (7.1 million metric tons), Ukraine (5.5 million metric
tons),  Bulgaria  (739  thousand  metric  tons),  and  Burma  (Myanmar)
(381 thousand metric tons).‡ 43 In 2023, China consumed 307 million
metric tons of corn and had a dependency rate of 8.3 percent.§ 44

¶ The  conclusion  that  China  has  fallen  below  the  95  percent  target  is  based  on  calculations
below.  Additionally,  China  now  imports  more  grains—most  notably  soybeans,  corn,  wheat,  and
rice—than any other country. Gustavo F. C. Ferreira, written testimony for U.S.-China Economic
and Security Review Commission, Hearing on China’s Stockpiling and Mobilization Measures for
Competition and Conflict, June 1, 2024; Zongyuan Zoe Liu, “China Increasingly Relies on Import-
ed Food. That’s a Problem,” Council on Foreign Relations, January 24, 2023.

† Crop  production  is  measured  across  a  marketing  year,  or  the  12-month  period  starting  just
after harvest when a crop may be sold. Since all crops have different harvest schedules, market-
ing seasons are not precisely comparable across crops or between crop production and import and
export values (which tend  to reflect  calendar years). To  avoid confusion,  all marketing years are
referred  to  by  the  year  in  which  they  started.  Additionally,  data  on  imports  and  exports  reflect
values from the year in which the marketing year began.

‡ Figures  for  corn  imports  are  determined  using  the  HS  code  1005.90  for  corn  crops  excluding
seeds. This may include corn meant for human consumption as well as for livestock feed or other
uses. To  ensure  foreign  producers  are  unable  to  outcompete  and  undermine  domestic  producers,
China  manages  its  annual  volume  of  corn  imports—typically  between  25  and  30  million  tons.

Rice: China is nearly self-sufficient in milled rice. China produced
144.6  million  metric  tons  of  milled  rice  in  2023  and  imported  an
additional  1.8  million  metric  tons,  making  it  both  the  world’s  larg-
est  producer  and  importer.* 45  China’s  primary  sources  of  imported
rice were countries in South and Southeast Asia, including Vietnam,
Thailand,  and  Burma.† 46  In  2023,  China  consumed  148.1  million
metric tons of rice and had a dependency rate of 1.2 percent.‡ 47

Wheat: China is mostly self-sufficient in wheat. Wheat is China’s
third most important crop  in terms of metric tons of  production.  In
2023,  China  was  the  largest  global  producer,  yielding  136.6  million
metric  tons  of  wheat  while  importing  11.9  million  metric  tons.48
Most of these imports came from Australia (6.9 million metric tons),
Canada  (2.5  million  metric  tons),  the  United  States  (925  thousand
metric  tons),  and  France  (815  thousand  metric  tons).§ 49  In  2023,
China consumed 154 million metric tons of wheat and had a depen-
dency rate of 8 percent.50

Pork:  In  addition  to  these  grains,  China  has  identified  pork  as
important for its food security. China is nearly self-sufficient in pork.
Pork is China’s primary protein and accounts for about 60 percent of
all  meat  consumed  in  the  country.51  In  2023,  China  produced  57.9
million  metric  tons  of  pork,  making  it  the  largest  producer  global-
ly.52  It  imported  1.5  million  metric  tons,  with  Brazil  (402  thousand
metric  tons),  Spain  (378  thousand  metric  tons),  Canada  (132  thou-
sand metric tons), and the United States (122 thousand metric tons)
as primary suppliers.¶ 53 In 2023, China consumed 59.7 million met-
ric tons of pork and had a dependency rate of 2.5 percent.54

China’s Global Agriculture Ambitions: The Smithfield
Acquisition

In  2013  the  Chinese  firm  Shuanghui,  now  called  WH  Global,
acquired  Smithfield  Foods  for  $4.7  billion  ($7.1  billion  including
debt), the biggest acquisition of a U.S. company by a Chinese firm
up  to  that  time.55  The  Committee  on  Foreign  Investment  in  the
United  States  (CFIUS)  approved  the  transaction.56  Four  years
after being acquired by WH Group, Smithfield purchased Kansas
City  Sausage  Co.  LLC,  one  of  the  United  States’  largest  sausage
producers and processors.57

As  China’s  largest  pork  producer,  Shuanghui’s  expansion  into
overseas markets was aligned with China’s “going out” strategy to
encourage some of its national champions to become multination-
al leaders.58 Ostensibly, China aimed to learn how to scale up its
meat production, increase sanitary standards, and secure imports

China’s domestic production.

* Milled  rice  has  been  processed  and  had  the  hull  removed,  making  it  suitable  for  human
consumption.  Rough  rice  has  not  been  processed  and  is  generally  not  intended  for  human  con-
sumption.  Import  values  for  milled  rice  are  based  the  six-digit  HS  classification  for  semi-  or
wholly-milled rice (1006.30).

China’s Global Agriculture Ambitions: The Smithfield
Acquisition—Continued
to respond to growing domestic demand for pork.59 The deal also
meant that Shuanghui acquired 146,000 acres of U.S. farmland.60
China has an affinity for pork. The character for home or family
in Chinese, 家 jia, depicts a pig under a roof. This common charac-
ter is used in the word for country or nation (国家 guojia). Indeed,
Xi’s first trip to the United States was to study hog farming.61 As
China  has  gotten  wealthier,  its  demand  for  meat  has  grown  and
China’s annual pork consumption now exceeds that of the United
States by a large margin.62

Since  the  Smithfield  acquisition,  Chinese  imports  of  U.S.  pork
products  have  increased.*  From  $704  million  in  2012,  Chinese
pork  imports  from  the  United  States  peaked  at  $2.3  billion  in
2020,  settling  back  to  $1.2  billion  in  2023,  still  a  76  percent  in-
crease from 2012 levels.† 63

A  decade  on,  the  Smithfield  acquisition  remains  contentious.
Some  argue  that  growing  agricultural  exports  to  China  is  a  net
positive,  as  is  generally  the  view  for  U.S.  agricultural  exports.64
Further,  the  United  States  could  limit  exports  to  China  if  neces-
sary,  regardless  of  the  ultimate  ownership  of  a  U.S.  subsidiary.
Others  have  raised  concerns  that  the  deal  could  pose “food  safe-
ty,  food  security  and  intellectual  property  concerns”  or  increase
domestic  U.S.  prices  if  exports  to  China  decreased  U.S.  supply.65
Further, recent years have seen growing concern about purchases
of U.S. farmland by Chinese entities.66

Smithfield  continues  to  have  a  large  presence  in  the  United
States.67  It  retained  the  U.S.  management  team  after  the  acqui-
sition,  and  its  products  continue  to  be  available  in  the  United
States.68 Recently, the Hong Kong-listed parent of Smithfield an-
nounced it would separate its North American and European op-
erations,  though  both  will  remain  WH  Group  subsidiaries  (with
a  U.S.  initial  public  offering  of  the  spun-off  Smithfield  contem-
plated).69

Significant  Import  Reliance  for  Soybeans:  The  last  product
China has identified as a staple is soybeans, which is the most sig-
nificant  challenge  to  Chinese  domestic  food  self-sufficiency.  While
soybeans can be directly consumed, China primarily uses the crop as

* After  Smithfield’s  acquisition,  exports  as  a  share  of  its  total  pork  sales  increased,  although
it  is  unclear  what  portion  of  those  exports  were  ultimately  consumed  in  China.  Smithfield  does
not break down export data by specific countries. In the five years leading up to the acquisition,
Smithfield’s export sales made up, on average, 16.2 percent of its total pork volume. Following the
acquisition,  in  2014,  its  export  sales  rose  to  23  percent  of  total  volume  and  continued  to  rise  to
25 percent in 2015. In 2016, Smithfield stopped publishing its annual investor report. Smithfield

animal feed or converts it into edible oils.70 Unlike its other staples,
China  is  heavily  dependent  on  imported  soybeans.  In  2023,  China
produced just 20.8 million metric tons of soybeans but imported 87.4
million metric tons.71 Of this volume, 59.7 million metric tons were
purchased  from  Brazil  and  22.4  million  metric  tons  (25.6  percent)
were purchased from the United States.72 In 2023, China consumed
121.7  million  metric  tons  of  soybeans  and  had  a  dependency  rate
of  81.1  percent.73  China  is  unlikely  to  resolve  this  dependency  by
increasing  domestic  production.  It  costs  nearly  30  percent  more  to
grow  soybeans  in  China  than  in  the  United  States,  while  the  yield
is 60 percent less.74

Efforts to Improve Food Security

Chinese leaders are trying to improve food security by expanding
agricultural  land,  investing  in  productivity  enhancing  technology,
reducing  demand,  and  engaging  in  stockpiling. These  policies,  how-
ever,  have  their  limits.  Environmental  degradation,  climate  change,
and growing consumption mean China’s domestic food security will
worsen  in  the  short  term—even  if  it  becomes  less  reliant  on  the
United States.

Gustavo  Ferreira,  a  senior  agricultural  economist  at  the  U.S.
Department  of  Agriculture,  points  out  that  China  has  steadily  in-
creased state investment in agricultural research and development.
Chinese  officials  hope  to  strengthen  domestic  scientific  and  techno-
logical  expertise  in  modern  agriculture  and  improve  the  country’s
agricultural  equipment.  In  particular,  China  has  focused  resources
to boost the development of its seed industry.* 76

China  has  also  tried  to  reduce  domestic  demand,  focusing  on
soybeans.  China  has  urged  domestic  livestock  feed  producers
to  incorporate  alternative  oilseeds  like  rapeseed  or  sunflower
seed  which  could  be  sourced  from  countries  such  as  Canada  or
Ukraine.77  In  2023,  Chinese  officials  implemented  a  three-year
action  plan  to  reduce  soybean  meal  ratios  in  animal  feed  from
14.5  percent  in  2022  to  less  than  13  percent  by  2025.  Such  a
change  could  reduce  imports  by  as  much  as  four  million  metric

* The  Chinese  Academy  of  Agricultural  Sciences  (China’s  national  agricultural  scientific  re-
search  organization)  laid  out  a  five-year  development  plan  calling  for  the  construction  of  new
laboratories,  a  grain  crop  science  center,  and  enhancements  in  breeding  capacity  for  crops  and
livestock. Genevieve Donnellon-May and Zhang Hongzhou, “Hungry China’s Growing Interest in

tons a year.78 All else equal, this would reduce Chinese consump-
tion  by  3.7  percent  and  leave  them  with  an  import  dependency
rate  of  80.4  percent.*

China is also diversifying soybean imports away from the United
States.  While  Brazil  had  been  slowly  gaining  market  share  start-
ing  about  15  years  ago,  the  erosion  of  the  U.S.  position  in  China’s
market  accelerated  dramatically  with  the  2018  trade  war.  Chinese
purchases  of  U.S.  soybeans  collapsed  in  2018  following  a  25  per-
cent  tariff  implemented  by  China.  During  the  2016–2017  season,
immediately  prior  to  the  trade  war,  China  sourced  41  percent  of
its  soybeans  from  the  United  States  and  46  percent  from  Brazil.79
During  the  2018–2019  season,  this  shifted.  China  sourced  some  75
percent  of  imports  from  Brazil  compared  with  19  percent  from  the
United  States.80  While  trade  has  since  stabilized,  in  2023  China
still  sourced  68  percent  of  its  soybeans  from  Brazil  compared  with
26  percent  from  the  United  States.81  Expansive  South  American
production  capacity  means  China  could  theoretically  divert  all  its
soybean procurement to the region. However, total reliance on South
American imports would expose China to new risks from geographic
and growing season concentration.† 82

China  has  found  other  willing  partners  in  its  Belt  and  Road
Initiative  (BRI)  members.  Since  its  introduction  in  2013,  China
has  signed  over  100  agricultural  cooperation  agreements  with
BRI  countries.83  Russia  has  emerged  as  a  key  supplier.  In  2023,
following  a  meeting  between  General  Secretary  Xi  and  Russian
President  Vladimir  Putin,  a  Russian  company  signed  a  $26  bil-
lion  agreement  to  supply  70  million  tons  of  grain,  legumes,  and
oilseeds to Chinese buyers over the next 12 years.‡ 84 This builds
on  longstanding  efforts  to  increase  two-way  trade  such  as  the
Russia-China  Land  Grain  Corridor,  an  initiative  launched  in
2016  to  build  out  infrastructure  supporting  the  export  of  grain
by  Russia  and  other  Eurasian  countries  to  China.85  Russia’s
abundant  wheat  production  could  serve  as  additional  insurance
to  safeguard  Chinese  food  security.86

China’s Significant Food Stockpiling

In addition to other policies to enhance food security, China main-
tains  large  emergency  food  stockpiles  of  agricultural  products  and

* Calculation  shows  the  change  in  the  import  dependency  rate  if  the  entirety  of  the  reduced
demand  is  offset  by  a  decline  in  imports  with  no  changes  to  other  consumption  or  domestic
production.

† Although  the  United  States’  and  Brazil’s  soybean  growing  seasons  are  complementa-
ry,  Brazil  has  been  increasingly  able  to  capture  U.S.  market  share  during  peak  U.S.  ex-
port  season.  Typically,  more  than  60  percent  of  annual  U.S.  soybean  exports  to  Chi-
na  occur  between  October  and  January,  when  Brazilian  supplies  are  presumably  low.
However,  in  2024,  U.S.  soybean  exports  to  China  during  that  four-month  period  were  2.8  mil-
lion  metric  tons  more  than  Brazil.  Historically,  outside  of  2018–2019  and  2019–2020,  at  the
gap  would  be  a  minimum  13  million  metric  tons  and  possibly  up  to  25  million  metric  tons.

‡ Since  2022,  China  has  lifted  numerous  sanitary  restrictions  that  have  previously  prevented
the  import  of  Russian  agricultural  products.  In  2022,  China  began  to  allow  the  import  of  spring
wheat  and  barley  from  Russia.  In  2023,  peas  and  millet  received  approval.  The  two  countries
are  currently  negotiating  lifting  restrictions  on  the  Chinese  import  of  Russian  corn  and  rice.

pork,  significantly  out  of  proportion  to  global  norms.*  The  compo-
sition,  volume,  and  quality  of  these  reserves  are  a  state  secret  and
can  only  be  estimated.87  Official  communications  state  that  China
has built nearly 700 million metric tons of grain storage capacity.88
Using data provided by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA),
Nikkei  estimates  that  China’s  share  of  global  grain  stocks  (corn,
rice, wheat, soybeans) increased by at least 15 percent for each crop
from 2011 to 2021.89 The USDA estimates that as of the first half of
2022, China holds 69 percent of the world’s corn reserves, 60 percent
of  its  rice,  and  51  percent  of  its  wheat.90  With  only  18  percent  of
global  population,  China  holds  just  over  half  of  global  staple  grain
reserves.  China  also  maintains  a  strategic  pork  reserve.  In  July
2023,  the  Chinese  government  indicated  it  stockpiled  20,000  tons
of pork in order to replenish national reserves, suggesting the total
reserve volume is higher.91

Because  the  true  size  of  its  stockpiles  is  unknown,  it  is  uncer-
tain  how  long  these  reserves  could  sustain  China.92  While  anec-
dotal  evidence  suggests  China  has  somewhere  between  one  to  two
years’ worth of stocks of key agricultural commodities, even Chinese
officials  with  complete  access  to  information  likely  cannot  give  a
precise  estimate.93 The  scale  of  China’s  stocks  require  a  very  large
grain storage infrastructure and complex management to ensure the
viability of the stored commodities.94 As a result their true size and
usability is likely not fully assessable.†

Perspective on Food Security Efforts

In  terms  of  evaluating  China’s  food  stockpiling,  it  is  notable
that projections of Chinese grain stockpiles have not substantial-
ly  increased  in  recent  years.  The  USDA  projects  that  total  Chi-
nese  ending  stocks—the  amount  of  grain  left  in  the  country  at
the end of each year and an imperfect proxy for reserves—peaked
for wheat and rice in 2019.95 Corn peaked even earlier, in 2016.96
Since then ending stocks have fallen, with rice declining 10.7 per-
cent.97  In  contrast,  Chinese  soybean  ending  stocks  have  contin-
ued  to  rise,  though  they  remain  far  below  Chinese  stockpiles  of
corn,  wheat,  or  rice.98

* Note  that  official  data  on  these  stores  are  not  publicly  available  but  can  be  pieced  together

using official statements and proxy indicators.

† There  are  also  concerns  about  the  accuracy  and  reliability  of  grain  reserves  data  as  well  as
China’s broader agriculture production data. A lack of transparency, recent arrests and investiga-
tions related to corruption, and quality concerns all obscure China’s stockpiling. For example, in
2022, the former top official at the National Food and Strategic Reserves Administration (respon-
sible for centralized control over stockpiled grain), Zhang Wufeng, was sentenced to ten years in
prison  for  taking  bribes,  and  in  May  2024,  current Agriculture  and  Rural Affairs  Minister Tang
Renjian  was  placed  under  investigation  by  the  anti-graft  agency  for  “serious  violations”  of  the
law. More broadly, some academics have called into question the overall reliability of data in the
agriculture sector. They argue that important government subsidies to the major grain-producing
counties created incentives for over-reporting production and that the lower administration level
that  generates  the  agricultural  data  has  a  higher  risk  of  data  manipulation  and  misreporting.

Energy Security in China

China’s Energy Composition

China’s massive population and rapid industrialization has meant
that demand for energy has outstripped domestic sources of supply.
As  a  result,  China  has  become  deeply  reliant  on  external  sources
of  key  energy  commodities.  Foreign  oil  imports,  in  particular,  are
China’s  largest  strategic  energy  vulnerability.  Xi  has  continued  to
push  for  enhanced  energy  security  saying  the  country  “must  hold
the  energy  food  bowl  in  its  own  hands.” 99  However,  his  efforts  are
influenced  by  various  factors,  including  concerns  about  market  vol-
atility,  making  it  difficult  to  discern  the  relative  significance  of  na-
tional security as a driver for his efforts.

Coal

While  China  may  be  most  concerned  with  oil  imports,  coal  is  the
country’s most significant energy resource. In 2022, it contributed 61
percent  of  the  country’s  total  energy  supply.* 100  Coal  is  central  to
Chinese energy security. The country’s abundant domestic resources
and  enormous  coal  power  generation  capacity  make  it  a  significant

hedge against energy insecurity and geopolitical uncertainty.101 Chi-
nese  reserves  also  mean  coal  is  the  only  major  energy  commodity
where  the  country  is  typically  a  net  exporter.102  This  has  allowed
Chinese  officials  to  focus  energy  contingency  plans  on  production,
rather than stockpiling or energy import infrastructure. China’s nat-
ural supplies have allowed the country to pursue a strategy focused
on  establishing  a  system  of  “dispatchable  coal  reserves.” 103  Under
the strategy, China’s National Development and Reform Commission
aims  to  develop  the  capacity  to  rapidly  increase  coal  production  by
300 million tons per year by 2030.104 Combined with an abundance
of coal power plants, China could surge coal production and allow its
coal-fired power capacity to fill energy production gaps.* Because of
these factors, China stockpiles a relatively meager 200 million tons
of coal at major power plants, approximately a 30-day supply.† 105

Natural Gas

Natural gas is less critical to China’s energy mix than either coal
or  oil.  In  2021,  natural  gas  made  up  just  3.1  percent  of  China’s
total  electricity  generation.106  China  primarily  uses  natural  gas
to  heat  homes,  to  cook  food,  and  as  an  input  in  certain  industrial
processes.107  Replacements  such  as  coal  or  electrical  heaters  can
substitute  for  gas’  most  important  use  cases.108  Still,  China  is  very
dependent  on  foreign  natural  gas.  In  2023,  China  imported  165.6
billion  cubic  meters  (BCM),  or  42.3  percent  of  its  total  natural  gas
consumption.109  China’s  import  dependence  is  worsening.  In  2023,
the  country’s  reliance  on  foreign  natural  gas  increased  1.1  percent
from 2022.110 In recent years, China has focused on rapidly expand-
ing its natural gas storage capacity. CEDIGAZ, a gas analytics firm,
estimates  that  Chinese  firms  operate  21.3  BCM  of  working  under-
ground  gas  storage  capacity  plus  an  additional  8.1  BCM  of  tank
storage  at  liquefied  natural  gas  import  facilities.111  The  firm  fore-
casts that the country’s gas storage capacity could rise to 80 BCM of
working  gas  storage  capacity  by  2030.112  In  2023,  China  consumed
395 BCM of natural gas.113 By 2030, China National Petroleum Cor-
poration  forecasts  the  country  will  consume  between  550  and  600
BCM of natural gas.114

Chinese  policymakers  appear  to  perceive  natural  gas  storage  as
more of a market management tool than a safeguard ensuring ener-
gy  security.  Gabriel  Collins,  fellow  at  Rice  University’s  Baker  Insti-
tute, notes, for example, that in China’s 2023 Energy Work Guiding
Opinion,  a  document  produced  by  China’s  National  Energy Admin-
istration  and  disseminated  to  all  relevant  provincial-level  agencies
to guide and help implement energy policies, policymakers associate
natural  gas  development  with “bolstering  energy  system  regulation
capacity.” 115  Because  of  this,  he  suggests  Chinese  energy  officials
are more concerned with managing natural gas’s seasonal price vol-
atility—buying  cheap  natural  gas  in  the  summer  and  storing  it  to

* In 2022, China’s average coal plants utilization rate was 53 percent, far lower than its historic
average of 70 percent. China’s low typical utilization rate means it has ample space to surge coal
power output if needed. Bing Han and Choon Kiat William Chia, “China’s Record Coal Capacity
Approvals in 2022: Will Carbon Targets Still Be Met?” S&P Global, April 27, 2023.

† China’s  stockpile  size  is  variable  and  fluctuates  based  on  a  range  of  different  factors.  For
example, in January of 2024, Chinese coal stockpiles were as low as 120 million tons before low
prices  allowed  stocks  to  climb  to  162  million  tons  by  May  2024.  Bloomberg  News, “China’s  Glut
of Coal Delivers Early Success in Dodging Summer Shortages,” June 25, 2024.

use when prices spike in the winter—than ensuring the country has
a robust, contingency supply.116

Oil

China  is  deeply  reliant  on  foreign  oil.  However,  unlike  natural
gas,  which  is  nonessential  and  can  be  substituted  with  coal,  oil’s
centrality  to  both  the  domestic  economy  and  the  military  make  it
China’s  most  significant  resource  vulnerability  in  a  crisis  scenar-
io.117  Chinese  officials  have  noted  that  electricity  supply  problems
“can be solved by ourselves” but that “oil imports are different . . . . If
our  oil  imports  are  cut  off,  it  affects  the  whole  nation,  not  just  cer-
tain provinces, and we no longer maintain self-reliance.” 118 Chinese
strategists  have  long  viewed  the  country’s  increasing  reliance  on
foreign  oil  imports  as  a  key  vulnerability  and  a  potentially  serious
constraint on Chinese strategic action.119 This has compelled China
to  pursue  a  series  of  diversification  and  stockpiling  initiatives  to
mitigate the impact of potential future disruptions.

China became a net oil importer in 1993.120 In 2023, the country
was only able to produce 27 percent of its oil domestically.121 China
imported  an  average  of  11.3  million  barrels  a  day  while  produc-
ing 4.2 million barrels a day. China has tried to minimize the risks
brought about by its overreliance on foreign sources by maintaining
a  diverse  mix  of  friendly  suppliers.  In  2023,  China  sourced  4.4  per-
cent of its oil imports from the G7 (with the United States and Can-
ada  being  the  largest  suppliers).122  Instead,  China  has  historically
sourced  around  half  of  its  imports  from  Gulf  countries.123  Because
of  this,  China  has  sought  closer  ties  with  the  region.  (For  more  on
China’s engagement with the Middle East, see Chapter 5, “China in
the Middle East.”) China is also slowly building a naval presence in
the area. The U.S. Department of Defense lists the Strait of Hormuz
as  a “known  focus  area”  for  Chinese  military  planners.124 Analysts
suggest  China  is  building  a  robust  presence  to  potentially  counter
U.S. efforts to block oil transit during a crisis.125

In 2023, Russia emerged as China’s most important single suppli-
er.126 Buoyed by the “no limits” partnership they declared in Febru-
ary  2022,  Chinese  refiners  have  rapidly  expanded  purchases  of  the
Russian crude that had flowed to Europe prior to Russia’s invasion
of  Ukraine.* 127  However,  even  among  its  partners,  China  is  wary
of  the  risks  that  come  from  overreliance.  Shipping  insiders  believe
China caps oil imports from any country at around two million bar-
rels per day.128

Despite China’s supply diversification, most of these oil imports
reach China via seaborne tankers. Asia’s island geography means
that  80  percent  of  China’s  total  oil  imports  must  pass  through
the  Strait  of  Malacca,  separating  Indonesia  and  Singapore,  mak-
ing  the  waterway  a  critical  vulnerability.129  Xi’s  predecessor,
General  Secretary  Hu  Jintao  was  profoundly  concerned  by  this

* In  response  to  the  invasion  of  Ukraine,  the  G7  has  tried  to  impose  a  price  cap  of  $60  dollar
per barrel on Russian crude oil exports. While the G7 has not been able to fully enforce it, their
sanctions and pressure has led to a minor discount in Russian crude. As a result, in 2023, China
was able to purchase Russian crude at an average price of $77 per barrel. This was around a $6
dollar  per  barrel  discount  and  resulted  in  a  nearly  $5  billion  total  discount  in  2023.  Bloomberg,

ergy  Information  Administration,  Brent  Crude  Oil  Prices  Averaged  $19  Per  Barrel  Less  in  2023

and called China’s overreliance on the route the “Malacca Dilem-
ma.” 130  However,  under  Xi,  China’s  susceptibility  to  a  disruption
in the Strait of Malacca has worsened. In 2013, Xi’s first full year
as  General  Secretary,  China  relied  on  imports  for  57  percent  of
its  total  crude  oil  supply.  By  2023,  its  import  rate  had  grown  to
76  percent.131  China’s  less  secure  seaborne  oil  imports  have  also
similarly risen, growing from 91 percent in 2009 to 97 percent in
2023.132  China  has  had  some  options  to  slow  this  growth,  such
as  a  new  oil  pipeline  with  Russia  that  has  been  discussed  since
2018.133

Instead,  Chinese  officials  have  prioritized  constructing  large  oil
storage  facilities  and  developing  and  encouraging  substitutes,  such
as  electric  vehicles  (EVs),  wherever  possible.*  In  2021,  49  percent
of  total  final  consumption  of  oil  products  was  used  for  transporta-
tion.134 As a result, one way China is hoping to decrease its overall
demand  is  through  alternatives  such  as  transportation  electrifica-
tion.  Starting  in  2001,  China’s  Ministry  of  Science  and  Technology
issued a strategic plan to develop new energy vehicles and conduct-
ed research into them under the 863 Program, a high-tech develop-
ment  plan.135  Over  the  next  two  decades,  China  continued  to  focus
resources into the program.

With  strong  state  support,  China’s  domestic  EV  sector  was  able
to  develop  quickly,  and  starting  in  2020,  it  began  to  rapidly  gain
market share in new consumer car sales. The International Energy
Association  projects  that  in  2024,  EVs  could  account  for  up  to  45
percent  of  new  car  sales  in  China,  up  from  30  percent  in  2022.136
This  would  mean  that  by  the  end  of  2024,  around  10  percent  of
China’s total passenger vehicle fleet is likely to be either an EV or a
plug-in hybrid.137 By 2030, one in three cars on Chinese roads could
be EVs.138 Chinese EV adoption is meaningfully slowing China’s oil
consumption  growth.†  If  trends  continue,  the  International  Energy
Association  estimates  that  by  2030,  EVs  could  reduce  the  country’s
daily  oil  consumption  by  two  million  barrels  a  day  and,  by  2035,
over three million barrels a day.139

While such widespread adoption would be an important milestone,
it  still  only  represents  a  fraction  of  China’s  overall  oil  demand.  Re-
searchers  affiliated  with  China  National  Petroleum  Corporation
project  that  China’s  oil  demand  is  expected  to  peak  by  2030  at  be-
tween  780  million  and  800  million  metric  tons  per  year,  or  around
15.6  million  to  16  million  barrels  per  day.‡ 140 To  ensure  China  can
satisfy  its  consumption  needs  in  a  crisis  scenario,  Chinese  leaders
have undertaken a massive buildout of its domestic oil storage.

* Chinese firms continue to also engage in domestic drilling efforts, but limited natural reserves
constrain  their  ability  to  become  a  meaningful  replacement  for  China’s  foreign  dependence  and
instead appear to emphasize “running harder to stay in place.” Gabriel Collins, written testimony
for  U.S.-China  Economic  and  Security  Review  Commission,  Hearing  on  China’s  Stockpiling  and
Mobilization  Measures  for  Competition  and  Conflict,  June  1,  2024;  Reuters, “China’s  Oil  Produc-
tion Rises to 208 Mln Tons in 2023—CCTV,” January 9, 2024.

† While  EVs  can  slow  consumption,  it  is  unclear  how  long  and  where  the  bright  line  sits  for
EVs  to  reduce  overall  gasoline  demand.  It  is  dependent  on  a  number  of  factors,  most  notably
how  many  new  internal  combustion  engine  vehicles  also  are  sold  in  the  coming  years.  Gabriel
Collins, using Norway’s substantial EV adoption as a reference point, estimates that China would
need around 80 million EVs for this to happen. Gabriel Collins, written testimony for U.S.-China

Measures for Competition and Conflict, June 1, 2024.

‡ It is unclear how China National Petroleum Corp accounts for EV adoption within its projec-

tions. Nonetheless, the numbers show the absolute scale of Chinese oil demand.

475

From  2016  to  2024,  China’s  aboveground  crude  oil  inventory  has
ranged from 850 million to just over one billion barrels.141 As of late
May  2024,  China  had  about  942  million  barrels  of  crude  oil  stored
in  aboveground  tanks  onshore.* † 142  China’s  total  storage  capacity
is likely larger. Kayrros, an energy data provider, suggest that Chi-
na’s total crude storage capacity is currently a little over 1.8 billion
barrels.143

China  has  grown  its  storage  capacity  considerably  over  the  last
two  decades.  From  2005  to  2024  storage  has  roughly  tripled  while
overall  oil  consumption  has  doubled.144  Chinese  capacity  tends  to
cluster  around  oil  ports  capable  of  accepting  very  large  crude  car-
riers.145  This  means  they  are  predominantly  located  in  Shandong,
Zhejiang,  Liaoning,  and  Guangdong  provinces.  Shandong  and  the
Greater  Shanghai  Area  is  China’s  largest  oil  import  and  storage
zone. The region is home to more than 500 million barrels of storage
capacity.146

China’s Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) is a subset of its overall
reserve capacity. Discussions of an SPR began in the 1980s, though
a drawn-out debate over its potential costs  and utility  delayed  con-
struction until 2004.147 China’s growing foreign dependence justified
its  creation,  and,  by  2009,  the  Phase  I  SPR  sites—located  at  Zhen-
hai,  Zhoushan,  Huangdao,  and  Dalian—were  built  and  filled  with
103 million barrels of oil.148 Phase 2 was completed in 2019 and can
store  roughly  200  million  additional  barrels  of  oil.149 A  third  phase
of  the  project  is  currently  under  consideration  and  would  bring  the
SPR’s total capacity to around 500 million barrels.150

Notably, after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine demonstrated the vul-
nerability  of  aboveground  storage,  China  has  likely  accelerated  the
development of underground oil storage.‡ 151 In 2023, China Nation-
al  Petroleum  Corporation  (CNPC)  announced  the  launch  of  a  spe-
cial “Mined Cavern Underground Oil Storage Laboratory” signifying
a  long-term  commitment  to  expanding  underground  oil  storage  in
China.§ 152

Offsetting Potential of China’s Oil Stockpiles in a
Complete Blockade

China’s  enormous  oil  storage  capacity  provides  a  considerable
lifeline to help the country weather a complete blockade of its sea-
borne  oil  supply.  In  addition  to  its  storage,  China  has  a  number
of other levers it can pull to reduce and prioritize demand. China

also trigger catastrophic fires. Both Russia and Ukraine have targeted oil production and storage
facilities with success. Constant Méheut, “Ukraine, Stalled on the Battlefield, Targets Russia’s Oil

can  stop  the  export  of  refined  oil  products,  implement  rationing
to reduce non-military demand, continue to receive shipments via
land-based  pipelines  from  Burma,  Kazakhstan,  and  Russia,  and
even  work  with  Russia  to  rapidly  bring  online  additional  pipe-
lines  that  would  replace  the  existing  seaborne  supplies  China
gets from the Russian port of Nakhodka.

Mr.  Collins  estimates  that  taken  together,  a  large  stockpile,
aggressive  rationing,  and  secondary  fuel  supply  measures  mean
China’s  total  stocks  could  last  between  two  to  four  years  in  a
crisis  situation.  Each  incremental  100  million  barrels  of  storage
meets approximately two months of consumption needs in the “no
additional  overland  supplies”  scenario  and  closer  to  six  months
when augmented with Russian overland pipeline expansions.153

Aggressive  Chinese  Efforts  to  Ensure  Financial  Sanctions

Resilience

China’s  reliance  on  payments  networks  that  are  vulnerable  to
U.S.  financial  sanctions  to  process  a  majority  of  its  external  trade
and  finance  is  an  asymmetric  vulnerability  that  could  be  leveraged
against  it.  Chinese  leaders  are  acutely  aware  of  this  weakness  and
are  building  alternative  financial  networks  to  help  circumvent  or
evade  U.S.  financial  sanctions.  Despite  these  efforts,  China  is  un-
likely  to  succeed  in  the  short  term.  As  a  result,  a  maximalist  U.S.
sanctions  campaign  against  China  could  place  at  least  $3  trillion
in  annual  trade  and  financial  flows,  not  including  foreign  reserve
assets, at immediate risk of disruption.* 154

The  possibility  of  U.S.  financial  sanctions  has  motivated  China
to  pursue  the  creation  of  an  alternative  payments  network.  To
circumvent  U.S.  financial  sanctions,  China  must  succeed  across
three  areas:  (1)  promote  international  adoption  of  China’s  cur-
rency,  the  renminbi  (RMB),  as  a  viable  alternative  to  the  U.S.
dollar; (2) develop payments systems capable of facilitating RMB
transactions without U.S. oversight or interference; and (3) secure
willing partners to conduct RMB transactions using Chinese pay-
ments  systems.

Sufficiently internationalizing the RMB as a viable alternative to
the  dollar  and  identifying  partners  willing  to  transact  in  RMB  are
likely the most difficult challenges Chinese authorities face. Policies
that  internationalize  the  RMB  involve  explicit  tradeoffs  that  affect
Chinese  political  imperatives  to  maintain  financial  and  exchange
rate  stability.155  Additionally,  the  threat  of  U.S.  sanctions  and  sec-
ondary  sanctions  could  prove  to  be  an  insurmountable  obstacle  for

Four  banks  (the  Industrial  and  Commercial  Bank  of  China,  the  China  Construction  Bank,
the  Bank  of  China,  and  the  Agricultural  Bank  of  China)  were  sanctioned.  The  number  cap-
tures  the  estimated  role  of  China’s  Big  Four  banks  in  facilitating  trade  in  goods  and  ser-
vices,  repatriation  of  income  from  investments,  direct  investment,  and  portfolio  investments.

many  of  China’s  trading  partners  that  are  aligned  with,  or  reliant
on, the United States and its financial infrastructure.

RMB Internationalization

China  is  actively  promoting  the  internationalization  of  the
RMB  to  reduce  reliance  on  the  U.S.  dollar.  Chinese  officials  are
motivated  by  the  economic  and  security  benefits  that  would  ac-
crue to China’s economy from controlling an internationally used
currency.  China  is  trying  to  internationalize  the  RMB  through
the  development  of  offshore  RMB  pools  and  the  settlement  of  bi-
lateral  trade  in  RMB.

The  internationalization  of  the  RMB  can  be  understood  and
measured  in  two  interrelated  but  distinct  ways:  its  use  in  trans-
actions  and  its  role  as  a  store  of  value. The  RMB’s  use  in  trans-
actions refers to its ability to denominate the value and facilitate
the  exchange  of  goods,  services,  or  other  currencies.* The  RMB’s
role  as  a  store  of  value  refers  to  its  ability  to  maintain  value
over time. For government actors it is the currency in which they
choose  to  hold  their  reserves.  In  the  private  sector  it  is  often  the
currency  in  which  they  choose  to  issue  debt.156  Encouraging  the
use of the RMB in transactions is more important than promoting
its use as a store of value within the context of sanctions circum-
vention.157

RMB  internationalization  is  also  best  understood  as  a  spectrum.
Across  this  spectrum,  China  can  achieve  a  high-threshold  of  inter-
nationalization  where  the  RMB  surpasses  the  U.S.  dollar’s  role  in
transactions  and  as  a  store  of  value.  Crossing  this  threshold  would
mean  the  RMB  has  become  a  truly  international  currency,†  used
not  only  by  China  but  also  by  third  countries  in  transactions  that
do  not  involve  a  Chinese  party.  However,  it  is  unlikely  China  will
be  able  to  reach  this  level  of  RMB  internationalization.  Achieving
this  would  require  China  to  implement  structural  changes  to  its
economy, including liberalizing its capital account and adopting pol-
icies  that  would  easily  allow  foreign  entities  to  accumulate  claims
on RMB-denominated assets.‡ 158

Nevertheless, China may still be able to achieve a low-threshold of
internationalization  by  using  the  RMB  in  bilateral  transactions.159
With  sufficient  bilateral  use  of  the  RMB,  China  could  potentially
circumvent some U.S. sanctions because the RMB has become suffi-
ciently  internationalized  for  its  trading  partners  to  exclusively  rely
on it to conduct China’s most important business.160 In this scenario
U.S.  sanctions  would  still  cause  significant  disruptions  to  China’s

* This  captures  what  is  sometimes  referenced  as  money’s  unit  of  account  and  medium  of  ex-
change  function. A  currency  that  is  the  unit  of  account  for  a  specific  transaction  is  highly  likely
to also function as the medium of exchange for that transaction. Richard Friberg, “The Currency

accumulation of RMB-denominated claims while building investor confidence that they would be
able  to  easily  sell  those  assets  at  any  time.  Michael  Pettis, “Will  the  Chinese  Renminbi  Replace

to  use  the  RMB  to  facilitate  its  most  important  trade,  including  in
energy and raw materials.161

History of RMB Internationalization

China’s  interest  in  RMB  internationalization  began  as  an  eco-
nomic  policy  response  to  perceived  weaknesses  and  limitations
in the dollar-denominated international financial system. Chinese
concerns about the impact of a volatile external financial environ-
ment on its economic growth date back to at least the 1997 Asian
financial crisis.162 The 2008 global financial crisis amplified these
fears and catalyzed Chinese policymakers to begin pursuing RMB
internationalization.163  In  the  aftermath  of  the  global  financial
crisis,  Chinese  policymakers  lost  confidence  in  the  U.S.  financial
system  and  observed  a  reduction  in  available  dollar  liquidity.164
The  lack  of  adequate  trade  financing  constrained  China’s  recov-
ery  by  limiting  China’s  ability  to  export.165  Chinese  officials  saw
RMB internationalization as a way to avoid future disruptions to
dollar-denominated  trade  transactions.166  Chinese  officials  also
believed  an  international  RMB  would  improve  China’s  ability  to
influence  global  monetary  conditions  to  the  benefit  of  Chinese
businesses.167

Following  Xi’s  rise  to  power  in  2013,  Chinese  officials  became
increasingly  focused  on  how  RMB  internationalization  could  en-
hance  financial  security.  Just  one  year  earlier,  Chinese  experts
had  observed  how  the  United  States  utilized  financial  sanctions
to  remove  Iran  from  the  dollar-denominated  financial  system.168
Xi  viewed  RMB  internationalization  as  a  way  China’s  economy
could build resilience against similar sanctions that could be im-
posed  on  the  country  in  response  to  a  crisis  in  Taiwan.169  U.S.
financial sanctions on Russia have amplified Chinese concerns.170
U.S.  willingness  to  use  sanctions  has  led  some  Chinese  scholars
to  argue  that  the  security  benefits  of  RMB  internationalization
may  be  more  important  than  the  economic  advantages  of  an  in-
ternational  RMB.171

Policy Support for RMB Internationalization

Chinese  officials  have  supported  RMB  internationalization  by
implementing  policies  that  encourage  RMB  trade  settlement  and
investments  in  RMB-denominated  assets.  The  internationalization
process  began  in  July  2009  with  a  set  of  trial  measures  enabling
cross-border  trade  settlements  between  five  mainland  cities  and
certain  enterprises  in  Hong  Kong,  Macau,  and  ASEAN  member
countries.* 172  China  allowed  the  establishment  of  offshore  RMB
clearing  banks  in  Hong  Kong  and  Macau  to  carry  out  and  clear
RMB  in  cross-border  trade  transactions.173  In  the  following  years,
the  program  expanded  to  new  offshore  RMB  centers  including Tai-
wan,  Singapore,  and  London.† 174 To  allow  for  offshore  transactions
while still maintaining its stringent capital controls, China split the
RMB  into  two  currencies.  One  was  used  in  the  onshore  market  in
mainland China (CNY) and the other in the offshore market outside

† The  majority  of  offshore  RMB-denominated  transactions  still  take  place  in  Hong  Kong  (83.3
percent),  followed  by  the  United  Kingdom  (4.4  percent),  Singapore  (2.9  percent),  and  the  United
States (2 percent). As a result, offshore RMB transactions that are used to avoid sanctions would
likely flow via Hong Kong. SWIFT, “RMB Tracker,” September 2024.

mainland  China  (CNH).175  Policies  supporting  RMB  international-
ization focus on the offshore RMB.

Companies began to utilize the offshore RMB in transactions and
corporate  RMB  bank  deposits  located  in  foreign  financial  centers
grew  rapidly  from  2010  to  2015.* 176  Concurrently,  China  sought  to
develop  a  deep  and  liquid  pool  of  high-quality  offshore  RMB  assets
to  encourage  foreign  use  of  the  RMB  as  a  store  of  value.177  China
began encouraging the issuance of offshore RMB bonds—commonly
referred  to  as “dim  sum”  bonds.178  In  October  2009,  China’s  Minis-
try of Finance (MOF) became the first central government entity to
issue  a  “dim  sum”  bond.† 179  The  MOF  issuance  was  soon  followed
by foreign firms including McDonald’s, Volkswagen, and Caterpillar,
and, in 2012, HSBC issued the first “dim sum” bond outside of Hong
Kong.180

In  September  2016,  with  the  Obama  Administration’s  support,
China  successfully  lobbied  the  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF)
to  include  the  RMB  in  the  Special  Drawing  Rights  (SDR) ‡  bas-
ket.§181  The  inclusion  of  the  RMB  in  the  SDR  signaled  that  the
IMF  believed  the  RMB  should  be  held  as  an  international  reserve
asset.182  Inclusion  also  meant  the  IMF  considered  the  RMB—spe-
cifically  the  offshore  RMB,  as  the  onshore  RMB  was  still  subject  to
capital  controls—as  “freely  usable”  in  international  financial  mar-
kets.183 This designation helped alleviate foreign investors’ concerns
that China might restrict their RMB holdings, and growth in foreign
holdings of RMB assets followed.184

* In  2010  the  IMF  estimated  there  was  around  100  billion  RMB  in  offshore  deposits.  From
December  2013,  the  first  time  the  PBOC  released  complete  data,  to  December  2014,  the  value
of  RMB  deposits  held  outside  of  China  rose  from  RMB  1.6  trillion  to  RMB  2.4  trillion.  Malhar

† While  the  first  “dim  sum”  bond  was  issued  in  2007  by  the  China  Development  Bank,  the
MOF issuance was particularly notable in the development of the overall market. Repeated MOF
issuances helped establish a benchmark yield curve to facilitate pricing of “dim sum” bonds. Kev-

‡ The SDR is an interest-bearing international reserve asset maintained by the IMF that sup-
plements  sovereign  reserves.  Since  the  creation  of  the  SDR,  the  IMF  has  allocated  a  total  of
SDR 660.7 billion ($935.7 billion) to its member countries. IMF members can hold SDRs as part
of  their  foreign  exchange  reserves,  exchange  SDRs  for  freely  usable  currencies,  or  use  SDRs  in
transactions  with  the  IMF,  such  as  paying  interest  or  repaying  loans.  International  Monetary

2015 that the Chinese government will maintain control over cross-border financial transactions,

cision to include the RMB would legitimize China’s managed convertibility approach.” U.S.-China

China  must  balance  policies  that  improve  access  to  RMB  liquidi-
ty  and  enhance  external  willingness  to  use  the  currency  with  their
impact on domestic economic stability and Party control over the fi-
nancial system. Central to this tradeoff are China’s robust domestic
capital controls. The Party’s ability to control capital flows has been
essential to the country’s financial security and RMB exchange rate
stability.185  However,  capital  controls  also  strongly  deter  foreign
banks  and  businesses  from  holding  and  conducting  transactions  in
RMB.186  Capital  controls  prevent  market  participants  from  freely
exchanging the currency and from fully participating in Chinese fi-
nancial  markets.* While  Chinese  capital  controls  do  not  completely
prevent RMB transactions, they slow down or constrain these flows
considerably and create risks for foreign firms that Chinese officials
can tighten or halt them, trapping assets in China or altering their
value independent of market forces.187 This is a strong disincentive
for foreign entities to transact in RMB.

The  success  of  Chinese  efforts  to  internationalize  the  RMB  has
been mixed at best. Despite China representing 17 percent of global
gross  domestic  product  (GDP),  the  RMB  currently  accounts  for  a
much  smaller  share  of  various  measures  of  currency  international-
ization.188 While it is unrealistic for the RMB to surpass the dollar
as  the  dominant  international  currency, Western  sanctions  on  Rus-
sia  and  continued  Chinese  efforts  to  increase  the  attractiveness  of
the  RMB  may  help  increase  international  use  of  the  currency  over
the coming years.189

RMB Payment Infrastructure

China is developing an RMB payments network that can execute
and  conceal  RMB-denominated  transactions.  An  indigenous  pay-
ments network is an essential counterpart to an international RMB.
Without  a  payments  infrastructure  capable  of  functioning  indepen-
dent  from  the  dominant,  U.S.-led  global  financial  system,  Chinese
firms  will  still  face  difficulties  and  delays  in  conducting  RMB-de-
nominated transactions in a sanctions scenario.

Banks  rely  on  a  clearing  settlement  institution  as  well  as  a
electronic  financial  message  system  to  effectively  transfer  funds
across borders.191 The Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial
Telecommunication  (SWIFT),  headquartered  in  Belgium,  is  the
dominant  global  payments  messaging  platform.  SWIFT  is  not  a
bank  and  does  not  manage  accounts  or  hold  funds.  SWIFT  does
not  actually  transfer  money;  it  is  a  secure  messaging  platform
banks  use  to  send  instructions  with  standardized  codes  and  for-
mats  to  banks  in  other  countries.192  Standardization  simplifies
translation  and  the  need  to  confirm  the  identity  of  counterpar-
ties  and  customers.193  Prior  to  SWIFT,  a  cross-border  transac-
tion  often  required  the  exchange  of  more  than  ten  messages  and
labor-intensive  authentication  procedures.194  The  cost  and  effi-
ciency  gains  offered  by  SWIFT  mean  it  has  completely  displaced
other systems.195 Although there are no comprehensive estimates
of  its  share  of  global  payment  messaging,  SWIFT’s  largest  com-
petitors facilitated transactions worth less than half of a percent
of  SWIFT’s  volume.196

* Because FX transactions involve two currencies, the total percent share of all currencies adds

to 200 percent.

483

SWIFT’s ubiquitous role in cross-border transactions makes it an
integral  component  of  the  enforcement  of  U.S.  financial  sanctions.
SWIFT  shares  data  with  the  United  States  to  monitor  global  com-
pliance  with  U.S.  sanctions  and  secondary  sanctions.* 197 The  Unit-
ed  States  has  used  its  leverage  to  exclude  sanctioned  entities  from
using  SWIFT.198  The  United  States  has  several  ways  to  pressure
SWIFT to comply with U.S. sanctions. A vote by SWIFT shareholders
can compel it to take such action.199 While U.S. banks do not make
an outright majority, other banks, fearing secondary sanctions, may
side  with  them.  U.S.  officials  could  also  pressure  the  government
of  Belgium  or  the  EU  to  enforce  U.S.  sanctions.  Finally,  the  United
States  could  structure  its  sanctions  such  that  SWIFT  would  have
to comply with them if they wanted to continue to do business with
U.S. institutions.† 200

Transactions  coordinated  via  SWIFT  still  must  be  processed  by
a  separate  clearing  settlement  institution.  Clearing  settlement  in-
stitutions  act  as  intermediaries  between  transacting  parties,  en-
suring  that  transactions  are  completed  smoothly  while  minimizing
risk.201 U.S. and EU institutions also likely account for a majority of
cross-border  clearing  settlement  transactions.  The  Clearing  House
Interbank  Payments  System  (CHIPS),  based  in  the  United  States,
facilitated  $407  trillion  of  transactions  in  2021.‡ 202  TARGET2,  a
European  Central  Bank-run  payments  system,  facilitated  about
$520 trillion in transactions in 2020.203 Both of these platforms are
critical to global cross-border payments, though the presence of oth-
er clearing and settlement competitors mean they face more compe-
tition than SWIFT.204

China  is  actively  building  and  promoting  its  own  alternatives
to  SWIFT  and  Western  clearing  settlement  institutions.  Central
to  these  efforts  are  the  Cross-Border  Interbank  Payments  System
(CIPS)  and  its  wholesale  Central  Bank  Digital  Currency  (CBDC),
which is still being developed. Both platforms could help the country
facilitate  and  settle  some  domestic  and  cross-border  RMB  transac-
tions,  even  in  the  face  of  a  maximalist  sanctions  scenario.205  Sanc-
tions  would  still  impose  some  adjustment  costs  as  banks  and  their
willing counterparties onboard onto the new system. The complexity
and  dominance  of  U.S.  institutions  in  the  global  financial  system
also likely mean parts of China’s alternative infrastructure may still
rely on the United States for payments—and therefore remain open
to  disruptions.206  Still,  Chinese  officials  perceive  both  CIPS  and  its
wholesale  CBDC  as  central  tools  in  their  financial  sanctions  con-
tingency  plans  and  have  tried  to  accelerate  their  development  and
adoption.207

* SWIFT  initially  resisted  sharing  private  transaction  data  with  the  United  States.  However,
after the attacks of September 11, 2001, SWIFT allowed the United States access when Congress
threatened  to  sanction  the  society  itself.  More  recently,  including  after  U.S.  and/or  EU  sanctions
on Iran in 2012, North Korea in 2017, and Russia in 2014 and 2022, SWIFT continues to comply
with legislation or regulations to share information about transactions involving sanctioned per-
sons or institutions. Marco Cipriani, Linda S. Goldberg, and Gabriele La Spada, “Financial Sanc-

Cross-Border Interbank Payments System (CIPS)

China  developed  CIPS  as  an  alternative  payment  system  de-
signed  to  process  RMB  for  cross-border  transactions.  Launched  by
the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) in 2015 with the explicit goal of
promoting RMB internationalization, CIPS integrates  international
RMB settlement into the existing global financial architecture, most
notably through its interoperability with SWIFT.208

CIPS  currently  relies  on  SWIFT  messaging  capabilities  for  the
vast  majority  of  its  transactions.209  However,  CIPS  maintains  its
own messaging system for use by its direct participants. While CIPS’s
own  messaging  platform  is  interoperable  with  SWIFT  through  the
use of the ISO 20022 international payments messaging standard, it
is fully separated from any Western institution.210 Therefore, if the
Chinese banking system were excluded from SWIFT and U.S.-based
payments clearing networks, China’s financial institutions and their
counterparties  could  rely  on  CIPS  to  communicate  and  settle  pay-
ments.211  CIPS’s  own  messaging  platform  could  also  help  protect
Chinese transactions from secondary sanctions.

CIPS  adoption  has  been  rapidly  growing  and  likely  could  man-
age  and  onboard  China’s  global  trading  relationships  in  the  event
of U.S. sanctions. In Q4 2023, the system processed 35 trillion RMB
($4.9  trillion)  worth  of  transactions—on  average,  $53.6  billion  in
transactions  per  day.212  China’s  total  imports  and  exports  over  the
same  period  averaged  around  $16.2  billion  per  day.213  CIPS  usage
continues  to  grow.  Its  Q4  2023  transaction  total  was  56.6  percent
higher than in Q1 2022, when the United States imposed sanctions
on  Russia.214  As  of  August  2024,  CIPS  reports  having  152  direct
participants  and  1,412  indirect  participants  covering  117  countries
and regions globally.215

Wholesale Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC)

The Chinese government is developing a cross-border CBDC that
could  also  be  leveraged  to  bypass  the  U.S.  payments  system,  offer-
ing  additional  sanctions  resilience.  Unlike  China’s  domestic  retail
CBDC, commonly called the digital yuan, or e-CNY, which is used for
person-to-person  transactions,  a  wholesale  CBDC  is  designed  to  be
used exclusively among financial intermediaries to settle interbank
transfers  and  similar  wholesale  transactions.216  China  is  exploring
a wholesale CBDC through a project named Multiple Central Bank
Digital  Currency  (m-CBDC)  Bridge,  or  Project  mBridge.*  China’s
wholesale CBDC development has key implications for U.S. national
security. Like CIPS, transactions made with it are conducted outside
of the current U.S. dollar and global payments infrastructure.217 As
a result, China’s wholesale CBDC could eventually become an alter-
native  cross-border  settlement  system  for  countries  willing  to  work
with China to evade U.S. sanctions. While China’s wholesale CBDC

* The  PBOC  collaborated  with  the  Bank  for  International  Settlements  (BIS)  Innovation  Hub,
the Bank of Thailand, the Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates and the Hong Kong Mone-
tary Authority on Project mBridge. Project mBridge aims to address inefficiencies in cross-border
payments,  including  high  costs,  slow  transaction  speeds,  the  decline  of  correspondent  banking,
and operational complexities. In June 2024, Project mBridge reached the minimum viable product
stage,  enabling  participants  to  conduct  real-value  transactions.  Project  mBridge  members  are
now  working  with  private  sector  firms  to  further  develop  the  platform.  Bank  for  International
Settlements,  “Project  mBridge  Reaches  Minimum  Viable  Product  Stage  and  Invites  Further  In-
ternational Participation,” June 5, 2024.

should mostly be viewed as an alternative platform to CIPS, it does
provide some additional security to the Chinese financial system in
a sanctions scenario. This is because China’s wholesale CBDC relies
on  the  PBOC  to  execute  payments.218 As  a  result,  attempts  by  the
United  States  to  disrupt  it  would  require  sanctions  or  secondary
sanctions  directly  on  China’s  central  bank.219  This  would  likely  be
perceived  by  China  and  third  countries  as  a  major  escalation  and
increases the risk of instability in the global financial system.220

RMB Internationalization across China’s Trade Partners

China  is  actively  promoting  RMB-denominated  trade  through
multilateral  institutions  and  in  bilateral  partnerships.221  In  the
first  half  of  2024,  China  was  able  to  settle  26.6  percent  of  its  to-
tal  trade  in  RMB,  up  12.6  percentage  points  from  the  first  half  of
2021.* 222  China  has  leveraged  its  influence  over  global  commodity
markets  in  particular  to  encourage  commodity-exporting  countries
to  use  the  RMB  in  their  trade.223  In  a  sanctions  scenario,  China
hopes to rely on these countries to supply it with critical energy and
commodity imports.224

Bilateral and Multilateral Currency Partnerships

China  has  proliferated  local  currency  use  partnerships  among
developing  economies  through  multilateral  organizations  including
the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO),† BRICS,‡ and ASE-
AN+3.§ Chinese support for local currency partnerships accelerated
following Western sanctions against Russia.225 China has sought to
capitalize  on  unease  around  Western  sanctions  among  some  mem-
bers  of  these  groups.226  For  example,  during  the  September  2022
SCO  Summit,  Xi  proposed  accelerating  the  development  and  use
of  local-currency  cross-border  payments  and  settlement  systems.227
Iran  has  joined  the  SCO  explicitly  because  of  the  organization’s
potential  to  help  it  circumvent  U.S.  sanctions.228  China  has  also
promoted  local  currency  transactions  across  BRICS  economies.229
Among  other  efforts,  BRICS  is  also  exploring  alternative  payments
systems  such  as  the  BRICS  Pay  system  for  retail  payments  and
transactions across member countries.230

ASEAN+3 is particularly important as its members currently set-
tle  the  largest  volumes  of  RMB-denominated  trade  with  China.231
ASEAN+3 is researching and pursuing deals to streamline local cur-
rency  settlement.232  China  has  capitalized  on  this  and  has  signed

tensive  and  longstanding  economic  connections  between  China  and
ASEAN  have  led  to  multiple  cross-border  uses  of  the  RMB,  includ-
ing the recycling of RMB received in exchange for exports to pay for
imports from China.235 In 2021, the most recent year with available
data, approximately 70 percent of the 5.8 trillion RMB China settled
in trade was with Asian economies.236

China Targets Commodity Exporters for RMB-Denominated Trade

China  is  working  to  increase  the  influence  of  the  RMB  in  global
commodities  markets  by  encouraging  the  commodities  it  trades  to
be  priced  in  and  exchanged  using  RMB.  Efforts  to  increase  the  use
of  the  RMB  in  global  commodities  markets  synergize  with  Chinese
efforts at the SCO and BRICS. Zoe Liu, senior fellow at the Council
on  Foreign  Relations,  points  out  SCO  and  BRICS  members  include
some  of  the  world’s  largest  hydrocarbon  and  minerals  exporters.237
Four  of  the  ten  largest  oil  producers  and  seven  of  the  ten  largest
iron producers are members of the SCO and/or BRICS.‡ §

China has leveraged its position as the world’s largest oil importer
and  a  critical  node  in  the  supply  chains  of  key  minerals  to  encour-
age  commodity  trade  in  RMB.238  As  a  key  buyer,  China  can  more
easily  seek  to  impose  RMB  payment  requirements  on  its  imports
from  foreign  companies.239  Countries  that  are  significant  exporters
to China, primarily in raw materials or commodities, tend to denom-
inate  more  trade  in  RMB.240  For  example,  in  2021,  major  commod-
ity  exporters  including Argentina, Algeria,  Brazil,  Chile,  Indonesia,
Kazakhstan,  and  Nigeria  used  the  RMB  for  a  significant  portion  of
their  trade  with  China.241  The  portion  of  China’s  commodity  trade
denominated in RMB continues to grow. In 2022, cross-border RMB
settlement  for  major  commodities  amounted  to  985.73  billion  RMB
($140 billion). In the first nine months of 2023, it grew to 1.5 trillion
RMB ($210 billion).242

To  enhance  the  RMB’s  use  and  pricing  power  in  global  commod-
ities  markets,  China  is  developing  new  trading  platforms  and  fi-
nancial instruments. In 2018, China launched RMB-denominated oil
futures  and,  in  2020,  copper  futures  on  the  Shanghai  International
Energy Exchange.243 Shanghai crude oil futures are now the world’s
third-largest crude oil futures after the WTI Crude and Brent Crude
futures.244 China also launched the Ganzhou Rare Metal Exchange
in 2019, to capitalize on its dominant role in supply chains to quote
RMB prices for spot trading of rare earths and critical minerals that
are  essential  to  the  clean  energy  transition.245  As  of  2023,  there

are  23  varieties  of  international  standardized  futures  and  options
commodity products listed in China and denominated in RMB.246

Chinese  officials  are  encouraging  their  foreign  partners  to  utilize
RMB trading and settlement systems. In a 2022 address to the Chi-
na-Gulf  Cooperation  Council,  Xi  emphasized  the  need  for  increased
use  of  the  RMB  in  oil  and  natural  gas  trading  and  settlement
through  the  Shanghai  Petroleum  and  Natural  Gas  Exchange  over
the next three to five years.247

Still,  RMB  usage  remains  significantly  behind  the  U.S.  dollar  in
global  commodity  markets.  Volumes  traded  on  the  Shanghai  and
Ganzhou exchanges trail the preeminent commodity pricing centers
of New York, Chicago, and London, and the U.S. dollar still denomi-
nates around 90 percent of major commodities trade in global mar-
kets.248 Substantial adoption of the RMB would not make commod-
ity  exporters  immune  from  dollar  sanctions.  Most  countries  would
still rely on the dollar for transactions not involving China.

Sanctioning China in a Crisis Scenario

The  United  States  and  its  allies  have  three  broad  avenues
through which they can impose economic sanctions targeting Chi-
na’s financial system. They can implement full blocking sanctions
which  would  prohibit  any  transactions  between  U.S.  individuals
and companies and Chinese entities.249 Importantly, this approach
would  include  key  parts  of  the  global  payments  infrastructure,
including clearing and settlement institutions and correspondent
bank networks, which are formal agreements or relationships be-
tween  banks  to  provide  cross-border  payments  services  for  each
other. Full blocking sanctions would not only prevent transactions
between  China  and  the  United  States  but  also  disrupt  transac-
tions  between  China  and  other  countries  that  rely  on  U.S.  pay-
ments  infrastructure.  The  United  States  can  also  impose  sover-
eign debt restrictions that would block debt issued by the Chinese
government,  central  bank,  national  wealth  fund,  and  companies
from U.S. markets. Finally, the United States could compel SWIFT
to impose a ban on Chinese institutions. This would prohibit the
provision of the SWIFT financial messaging service to sanctioned
Chinese entities. Full blocking sanctions and a SWIFT ban would
have the biggest impact on the Chinese economy.* 250

The  disruptions  to  global  supply  chains  caused  by  completely
cutting  off  the  world’s  largest  exporter  from  access  to  U.S.  dollar
financing,  however,  would  likely  generate  political  opposition  in
the  United  States  and  globally.†  A  2024  analysis  from  Rhodium

* In  addition  to  these  options,  the  United  States  could  freeze  a  large  share  of  China’s  $3.22
trillion  in  foreign  exchange  reserves.  However,  a  2024  study  from  Rhodium  Group  and  the  At-
lantic  Council  argues  this  would  neither  be  credible  nor  desirable  for  the  United  States.  The
primary effect would be to limit China’s capacity to defend its currency. Without Chinese support
the  RMB  would  experience  a  sharp  depreciation  and  make  China’s  exports  more  competitive  in
global  markets.  Logan Wright  et  al., “Retaliation  and  Resilience  Chinese  Economic  Statecraft  in
a Taiwan Crisis,” Atlantic Council, April 1, 2024, 33.

† U.S.  and  allied  sanctions  against  Russia  demonstrate  how  political  resistance  in  both  the
sanction  imposing  countries  and  other  global  economies  can  block  certain  actions.  While  sanc-
tions  aim  to  cause  the  most  disruption  to  the  targeted  country,  they  may  have  unintended  side
effects. For example, the United States and EU scaled back plans to ban the provision of financial
services  to  companies  transporting  Russian  oil  for  fear  that  fully  crippling  Russian  oil  exports
would  cause  a  surge  in  the  global  price  of  oil  and  a  global  recession.  Lutz  Kilian  and  David

Sanctioning China in a Crisis Scenario—Continued

Group  and  the Atlantic  Council  suggests  that  as  a  result,  China
believes complete restrictions on the country’s financing channels
are implausible.251 While the United States would sanction some
institutions,  China  could  respond  by  reallocating  critical  trade
and  financial  transactions  with  willing  partners  through  very
large or very small financial institutions.252 China can designate
a  series  of  small,  structurally  insignificant  financial  institutions
to conduct its trade, knowing they will be sanctioned. China’s use
of  the  Bank  of  Kunlun  to  circumvent  U.S.  sanctions  on  Iran  il-
lustrate  this.  China  designated  this  small,  state-owned  bank  to
continue to finance payments to Iran using the RMB. China’s use
of the Bank of Kunlun ensured it could continue to trade with the
sanctioned  country  without  risking  the  impact  of  U.S.  sanctions
on more important actors in its financial sector.* 253 Alternatively,
China could look to its largest financial institutions. Chinese offi-
cials may be calculating that the possibility of substantial disrup-
tions in permitted trade  and dislocations in  global supply  chains
could  be  threatening  enough  to  deter  the  imposition  of  sanctions
and secondary sanctions.254

China  could  also  rely  on  its  alternative  payments  infrastruc-
ture  to  circumvent  financial  sanctions  or  secondary  sanctions
that  are  designed  to  prevent  non-U.S.  entities  from  transacting
with  countries  subject  to  U.S.  sanctions.255  China  could  route
energy  imports  and  source  critical  commodities  and  components
via  countries  that  are  unlikely  to  cooperate  with  U.S.  sanctions.
To  do  so,  they  would  use  the  RMB  as  a  payment  currency.256
Dr.  Liu  argues  this  could  require  minimal  adjustment  time.257
Many  commodity  exporters  to  China  already  receive  some  RMB
for their current transactions.258 Still, sanctions—including freez-
ing  China’s  official  dollar  reserves—would  make  dollars  in  Chi-
na  scarce,  driving  down  the  value  of  the  RMB  exchange  rate.
A  weaker  exchange  rate  would  make  goods  imports  into  China
more  expensive,  distort  China’s  export  trade,  and  generate  sub-
stantial financial stress for Chinese companies operating in glob-
al  markets.259  Secondary  sanctions  would  still  cause  disruptions
to Chinese trade, but, because these would be perceived by third
countries as a significant escalation by the G7, the United States
would face broader constraints on such sanctions.260

In both scenarios, the limiting factor jeopardizing China’s abil-
ity  to  evade  sanctions  will  not  be  its  financial  infrastructure—
China can always admit new institutions into CIPS or, once live,
central banks into its wholesale CBDC. The functionality of these
networks  will  be  restricted  by  the  willingness  of  third  countries
to  use  them. Authors  of  the  Rhodium  Group  and Atlantic  Coun-
cil  study  suggest  the  imposition  of  U.S.  sanctions  would  likely
intensify  fears  around  the  liquidity  and  attractiveness  of  RMB
financial assets and raise the specter of the tightening of  capital

Sanctioning China in a Crisis Scenario—Continued

controls.261 This risk could likely deter many countries from con-
tinuing economic engagement with China.

Access  to  the  dollar  still  matters  far  more  than  the  RMB  for
the  vast  majority  of  China’s  trading  partners.  For  example,  Dr.
Liu  points  out  that  China’s  global  commodity  suppliers  depend
on  the  dollar-based  system  to  price  and  trade  their  commodity
exports.262 Their  banks,  as  well  as  most  of  China’s  other  trading
partners, remain reliant on SWIFT and CHIPS for their domestic
banking  system  as  well  as  their  international  payments  settle-
ments.  The  few  countries  that  are  willing  to  risk  the  impact  of
U.S. sanctions and secondary sanctions on their economy, namely
Russia,  Iran,  and  North  Korea,  cannot  fully  provide  China  with
the  substantive  material  support  needed  to  mitigate  U.S.  finan-
cial sanctions.263

Party-State Enhances Political Control over Institutions and

Society

Although CCP leaders’ language suggests they feel the risks they
face  are  escalating,  their  actions  in  the  political  realm  do  not  yet
clearly  indicate  they  are  preparing  for  an  imminent  war.  Official
rhetoric  aimed  at  Taiwan  and  the  United  States  has  become  con-
siderably  more  negative  and  intense,  but  it  has  not  taken  on  the
escalatory  tone  that  preceded  China’s  conflicts  with  its  neighbors
in  past  decades,  and  it  appears—for  now—to  be  leaving  the  door
open  for  dialogue  and  delay.  That  said,  observers  of  China  should
not rely wholly on indicators from past conflicts, as China’s political
environment and culture has evolved and official rhetoric is unlikely
to exactly match that seen in the Mao era. What is evident, however,
is  that  the  Party-state  has  accelerated  efforts  to  deepen  its  control
over  the  political  system  and  daily  life.264  These  include  measures
to build out the national security apparatus under CCP control, re-
vive  Maoist-era  methods  of  mobilizing  the  public,  coerce  industry
into heeding government directives, and deter Chinese citizens from
engaging  with  foreign  individuals. These  efforts  undoubtedly  assist
General Secretary Xi in his ongoing consolidation of power over Chi-
na but also create a system that is more agile in the face of external
threats and useful for sustaining a military conflict.265

CCP  Rhetoric  Intensifies  but  Falls  Short  of  What  Experts

Expect in Wartime

China’s  rhetoric  toward  the  United  States  and  Taiwan  appears
to  have  intensified,  although  it  has  not  yet  taken  on  the  harsh
tone  and  phrasing  that  preceded  China’s  prior  conflicts  and  does
not foreclose the possibility of communication. In their testimony to
the Commission, both Mr. Kewalramani and Timothy Heath, senior
international  defense  researcher  at  the  RAND  Corporation,  stated
they  would  expect  to  see  top  Chinese  leaders  demonize  the  United
States  and  Taiwan  and  assert  that  all  peaceful  means  of  resolving
the  dispute  had  been  exhausted  if  China  were  imminently  prepar-
ing  for  conflict.266  During  the  1950s  and  1960s,  Mao  directly  exco-

490

riated the United States in the harshest terms and called for mass
sacrifice  amid  his  country’s  proxy  conflict  with  the  United  States
in  Korea.267  Prior  to  the  Sino-Indian  border  war  in  the  1960s  and
China’s attack on Vietnam in 1979, Chinese leaders and state media
steadily escalated rhetorical attacks on their enemies, transitioning
from  threats  to  declarations  that  they  would  punish  them  or  teach
them a lesson.268

The CCP’s rhetoric today exhibits some of these escalatory aspects
but not others. For example, CCP officials have arguably already de-
monized Taiwan  President  Lai  Ching-te,  as  when  Foreign  Minister
and  Director  of  the  Central  Committee’s  Foreign  Affairs  Commis-
sion  Wang  Yi  called  him  a  traitor  to  the  nation  and  his  ancestors
and  warned  that  all  “ ‘Taiwan  independence’  separatists”  would  be
“nailed  to  the  pillar  of  shame  in  history.” 269  At  the  same  time,  se-
nior  Chinese  leaders  are  typically  oblique  in  their  condemnations
of  the  United  States,  with  Xi  mostly  opting  to  refer  indirectly  to
“certain  countries”  or  “Western  countries”  when  discussing  threats
of containment.* 270 There are some Chinese state media-sponsored
“documentaries”  that  paint  the  United  States  as  a  warmonger  and
a  handful  of  recent  films  that  depict  conflict  between  the  United
States  and  China,  but  as  Dr.  Heath  points  out,  there  is  far  less
media  demonizing  the  United  States  than  was  the  case  in  Maoist
times.271 Most importantly, the CCP continues to signal an openness
to  dialogue  with  the  opposition  party  in  Taiwan  and  to  emphasize
that  Taiwan  separatists  are  only  a  tiny  minority  of  the  popula-
tion.272 In these respects, the CCP’s contemporary rhetoric is clearly
milder  than  that  it  employed  in  the  runup  to  clashes  with  India  in
the 1960s and Vietnam in the 1970s.

Building  Out  the  National  Security  Apparatus  under  Party

Control

The  CCP  has  taken  steps  to  expand  the  power  and  refine  the
workings of its national security apparatus, framing these measures
as  elements  of  a  “new  security  pattern.” 273  These  include  creating
a  commission  to  coordinate  national  security  policy,  increasing  the
number of personnel with security experience in high-ranking posi-
tions,  passing  a  raft  of  new  laws  relating  to  national  security,  and
tightening  the  vise  on  Party  cadres  perceived  as  undisciplined  or
corrupt.

Xi-Led Commission Centralizes National Security Policy

A  critical  institution  in  the  CCP’s  national  security  apparatus  is
the Central National Security Commission (CNSC), which now plays
a  prominent  role  in  coordinating  national  security  decision-mak-
ing.† 274 The CNSC is a CCP Central Committee body mandated to

* A notable exception was Xi’s choice to explicitly name the United States during his comments
at the “two sessions” in March 2023. Chun Han Wong, “China’s Xi Jinping Takes Rare Direct Aim
at U.S. in Speech,” Wall Street Journal, March 6, 2023.

† Xi  presided  over  the  creation  of  the  CNSC  in  2014  by  elevating  the  previously  ad  hoc  Cen-
tral  National  Security  Leading  Small  Group  to  the  status  of  a  permanent  commission,  thereby
granting  it  a  permanent  staff  office,  a  regular  membership,  and  a  position  of  greater  influence
within the bureaucracy. He officially heads the CNSC. For more on the creation of the CNSC and
its  role  in  decision-making,  see  U.S.-China  Economic  and  Security  Review  Commission,  Chapter

examine all foreign and domestic issues through the lens of national
security,  effectively  giving  it  the  power  to  determine  who  or  what
constitutes  a  threat  to  national  security.275  National  security  com-
missions  have  also  been  established  at  all  levels  of  the  Party-state
system, from provincial down to township and district levels, to car-
ry out various research, national security law enforcement, and ed-
ucation functions.276 Although the workings of the CNSC are highly
secretive,  Sheena  Chestnut  Greitens,  an  associate  professor  at  the
University  of  Texas  at  Austin,  observes  that  the  CNSC  focuses  on
both domestic security and foreign policy issues.277 The March 2023
meeting  of  the  CNSC,  which  was  presided  over  by  Xi  and  attended
by top security officials, offered a glimpse of the high-level national
security  discourse  and  decisions  at  such  meetings.278  According  to
Xinhua’s readout of the meeting, officials assessed that national se-
curity problems facing China had “increased dramatically,” stressed
that they “must be prepared for worst-case and extreme scenarios,”
and stated that “more efforts must be made to modernize our nation-
al security system and capacity, and get prepared for actual combat
and dealing with practical problems.” 279 The meeting also reported-
ly approved new guidelines for “nationwide security risk monitoring
and early warning system” and public education on national securi-
ty.280 In an April 2024 article in the Party’s main theoretical journal
Qiushi, Ministry of State Security (MSS) Secretary Chen Yixin cred-
ited  the  CNSC  with  establishing  a “centralized,  unified,  and  highly
authoritative national security leadership system.” 281

Personnel  Appointments  Reflect  Growing  Importance  of  Security

Experience

Recent trends in leadership appointment suggest that experience
with  “national  security”  issues,  broadly  defined,  is  increasingly  im-
portant  among  China’s  leadership.  Multiple  analysts  have  suggest-
ed  that  the  composition  of  the  senior  Party-state  leadership  with
experience  in  national  security  has  recently  risen,  especially  since
the most recent 20th Party Congress in October 2022 and 14th Na-
tional People’s Congress in March 2023. For example, Guoguang Wu,
senior research scholar at the Stanford Center on China’s Economy
and Institutions, observed in November 2022 that at least ten of the
15 new leaders who joined the Politburo and Central Secretariat at
the  20th  Party  Congress  could  be  described  as  having  a  national
security  background.* 282 According  to  an  analysis  from  the  Brook-
ings Institution in March 2023, the makeup of the newly appointed
State  Council  “reflects  the  renewed  focus  on  state  security  and  so-
ciopolitical  stability,”  with  half  of  its  members  possessing  a  securi-

viduals with past experience and current responsibilities in the security sector of the Party-state;
military leaders; individuals with a background in the military industrial sector; and individuals

cy  internationally  or  domestic  repression  in  the  name  of  “stability.”  Guoguang  Wu,  “The  China

ty  or  military  background.* 283  Dr.  Greitens  assessed  in  November
2023  that  all  other  members  of  the  Politburo  Standing  Committee
have at least some experience with nonmilitary security policy, with
that experience being quite extensive for some.† 284 She also argued
that  some  noteworthy  appointments  under  Xi  have “hybrid  careers
within  the  internal  security  apparatus,”  with  experience  spanning
policing,  intelligence,  and  Party  discipline.‡ 285  In  her  testimony  for
the Commission, Katja Drinhausen, head of the politics and society
program  at  the  Mercator  Institute  for  China  Studies,  also  assessed
that  there  is  a  rise  in  officials  with  a  security  background, “mostly
in domestic security, but also focusing on technological security and
the economy.” 286

Updated Legal Canon Underpins the National Security Apparatus

The  CCP  has  codified  its  expansive  notion  of  national  security
through a series of laws over the past decade, constituting what one
Chinese  official  termed  a  “legal  Great  Wall  to  safeguard  national
security.” 287 These  include  the  2015  National  Security  Law  and  its
2020 counterpart for Hong Kong as well as additional laws on coun-
terespionage,  counterterrorism,  anti-foreign  sanctions,  access  of  for-
eign investments, managing foreign nongovernmental organizations
(NGOs),  intelligence,  and “state  secrets.” They  also  include  laws  on
cybersecurity,  data  security,  transportation  security,  and  biosecuri-
ty  as  well  as  more  political  topics  such  as  protecting  “heroes  and
martyrs” from defamation.288 Notably, many of the laws criminalize
the  disclosure  of  information  the  CCP  deems  sensitive  on  national
security grounds to foreigners, and they obligate Chinese citizens to
contribute  to  the  authorities’  national  security  activities.  One  2023
commentary  in  the  People’s  Daily  offers  statistics  measuring  this
purported legal progress, claiming that since 2015, 20 pieces of spe-
cialized  national  security  legislation  and  110  other  laws  and  regu-
lations  containing  national  security  clauses  had  been  promulgated,
formulated, or revised.289 Ms. Drinhausen assesses that China now
has  a  “very  well-established  legal  canon”  and  that  some  of  these

* The authors note that most of the members also possesses “extensive provincial-level econom-
ic  leadership  experience,”  suggesting  that  a  security  background  is  not  likely  the  only  consider-
ation. They also point out that economic issues are firmly intertwined with concerns about social
stability, making even economic experience potentially germane to Xi’s broadly defined concept of
national  security.  Cheng  Li  and  Mallie  Preytherch,  “China’s  New  State  Council:  What  Analysts
Might Have Missed,” Brookings Institution, March 7, 2023.

laws  have  shifted  what  are  considered  national  security-related  of-
fenses  under  Chinese  law  in  ways  that  affect  Chinese  citizens  and
foreigners alike.290

Recent  revisions  to  the  Counterespionage  Law  in  2023  and  State
Secrets  Law  in  2024  in  particular  have  elicited  international  con-
cern  due  to  their  expansive  scope  and  the  possibility  they  could  be
invoked  to  prosecute  foreign  companies  and  personnel  carrying  out
normal  business  activities  in  the  Mainland.* 291  Revisions  to  both
laws  added  Xi’s  broad  definition  of  national  security  into  the  text
by  invoking  the  Comprehensive  National  Security  Concept,  raising
uncertainty in terms of the issues to which their relevant legal  au-
thorities  will  be  applied.292  The  revision  of  the  Counterespionage
Law  simultaneously  expanded  the  definition  of  “espionage”  to  in-
clude  certain  efforts  to  obtain  “items  related  to  national  security”
where  it  had  previously  mentioned  only “state  secrets”  and “intelli-
gence.” 293 Additionally, it added conditions for the imposition of exit
bans  on  individuals  of  any  nationality  should  they  be “suspected  of
acts  of  espionage”  under  the  expanded  definition.† 294  The  revised
State  Secrets  Law  added  a  new  reference  to  a  category  of  informa-
tion  known  as  “work  secrets,”  information  that  does  not  qualify  as
state  secrets  but  would  cause  an  adverse  effect  if  leaked.‡295  Legal
observers  have  noted  that  what  constitutes  a “work  secret”  subject
to protection remains unclear under the law and thus vulnerable to
expansive,  inconsistent,  or  arbitrary  enforcement.296  For  example,
it  could  potentially  be  interpreted  to  include  information  obtained
through  conventional  research  and  due  diligence  efforts  or  investi-
gative journalism.297

Crackdowns on Ideological “Laxity,” Lack of Political Discipline, and

Corruption within the Party

Xi has led a continuing effort to tighten political control and crack
down on perceived problems with ideology, discipline, and corruption
in  an  effort  to  make  the  Party-state  more  efficient  and  responsive
to leadership directives.§ The CCP under Xi has sought to increase
ideological  conformity  through  a  combination  of  regulatory  chang-
es,  education  campaigns,  and  grassroots  measures.  The  Party  has
sought to strengthen the connectivity between the Party center and
the  grassroots  levels  through  more  frequent  events  and  mandatory
use of a smartphone app focused on ideological indoctrination.298 It
has  also  emphasized  the  importance  of  Party-wide  education  cam-

cation,  including  through  mass  media,  in  order  to  enhance  awareness  on  secrecy  issues  within
society  writ  large. These  are  added  despite  the  general  public  not  having  access  to  state  secrets

image  of  the  Party  and  adopting  the  policy  approaches  China  needs  to  succeed.  U.S.-China  Eco-

paigns as a necessary tool for guiding Party members and cadres.299
For example, in 2023 Xinhua pointed to the CCP’s 2012–2013 cam-
paign on the “mass line” and cleaning up “undesirable work styles,”
a 2015 campaign on strict self-discipline, a 2016 campaign on study-
ing  Party  documents  and  Xi’s  major  policies,  a  2019  campaign  on
the  Party’s “founding  mission,”  and  a  2021  campaign  on  Party  his-
tory  as  important  efforts  to  educate  cadres  in  light  of “complex  cir-
cumstances  facing  the  Party  both  at  home  and  abroad.” 300  Under
Xi’s  leadership,  the  CCP  has  additionally  issued  three  revisions  of
its  “Regulations  on  Disciplinary  Actions  of  the  Chinese  Commu-
nist  Party”  in  2015,  2018,  and  2023,  strengthening  the  documents’
emphasis  on  ideological  conformity,  organizational  discipline,  and
implementation  of  Party  policies.301  During  Xi’s  tenure,  the  Party
has  also  released  multiple  versions  of  its  “National  Cadre  Educa-
tion  and Training  Plan,”  the  most  recent  of  which  in  2023  laid  out
extensive  new  requirements  for  ideological  study  among  CCP  offi-
cials and aimed to improve cadres’ “political judgment.” 302 In 2023,
Xi  warned  that  Party  members  and  cadres  had  become  complacent
after  a  long  period  of  relatively  peaceful  conditions,  creating  a  risk
that future struggles will cause them to “panic and lose their confi-
dence easily.” 303 Shortly thereafter, the Central Commission on Dis-
cipline  Inspection  (CCDI)  launched  a  major  campaign  against  the
phenomenon of officials “lying flat” or doing only the bare minimum
in their obligations.304

Throughout  his  tenure,  Xi  has  made  expansive  use  of  his  signa-
ture  politically  motivated  anticorruption  campaign  in  an  attempt
to  bolster  the  legitimacy  of  the  Party,  curb  undesirable  behavior,
and  solidify  his  personal  power.* 305  Now  in  its  12th  year,  the  cam-
paign  shows  no  signs  of  abating  but  rather  continues  to  expand.
According  to  numbers  released  from  the  CCDI  in  January  of  2024,
about  110,000  CCP  officials  faced  disciplinary  action  as  part  of  the
campaign  in  2023  alone.306 At  an  address  to  the  third  plenary  ses-
sion  of  the  CCDI  in  January  2024,  Xi  reportedly  stressed  that  “in
the  continued  grave  and  complex  situation,  there  is  no  possibility
of  stopping,  slackening  or  compromising  the  anti-corruption  cam-
paign.” 307  (For  more  on  Xi’s  speech  at  the  CCDI  plenary  session,
see  Chapter  2,  “U.S.-China  Security  and  Foreign  Affairs  (Year  in
Review).”) According  to  one  tally,  more  than  30  Chinese  state  regu-
lators,  bankers,  and  senior  financial  executives  had  been  detained
for  corruption-related  charges  between  the  start  of  2024  and  mid-
May.308  Over  just  two  days  in  mid-July,  the  CCDI  announced  new
investigations  into  a  former  deputy  director  at  China’s  Ministry  of
Emergency Management, two leading officials from separate railway
state-owned enterprises (SOEs), and a Party committee secretary at
a  vocational  college.309  Senior  PLA  officers  have  also  been  targeted
by  the  wide-ranging  campaign.310  (For  more  on  the  anticorruption
campaign and punishment of PLA officers, see Chapter 2, “U.S.-Chi-
na Security and Foreign Affairs (Year in Review).”)

* While  the  Party  does  view  the  misuse  of  state  resources  as  a  threat  to  its  legitimacy,  its  an-
ti-corruption  campaigns  should  be  understood  primarily  as  tools  to  ensure  loyalty  and  political
control.  These  objectives  are  evident  in  revised  regulations  on  disciplinary  actions  released  in
2024, as well as Xi’s increased promotion of the concept of “self-revolution,” a Maoist phrase urg-
ing the Party to continuously monitor and control itself. For more on the ongoing anti-corruption
campaign, see Chapter 2: “U.S.-China Security and Foreign Affairs (Year in Review).”

Revival of Maoist Tools for Mass Mobilization

The  CCP  is  currently  reviving  Maoist  approaches  to  mobilizing
the  public  to  assist  it  with  detecting  and  eliminating  perceived  se-
curity  threats.  This  has  been  partially  evident  in  Chinese  officials’
public statements; Party leaders have explicitly referred to the Mao-
era  “mass  line”  method  of  bringing  the  Party  closer  to  the  people
in  security  matters,  invoked  historical  events  such  as  the  “Fengq-
iao  experience” *  and “Chaoyang  masses” †  to  encourage  the  revival
of  an  informant  culture,  and  called  for  mobilizing  all  of  society  to
“wage  the  people’s  war”  to  maintain  national  security.311  But  more
concrete examples include the CCP’s cooptation of the public for sur-
veillance and law enforcement activities as well as its renewed em-
phasis  on  mass  education  campaigns  designed  to  boost  patriotism
and national security awareness.

Coopting the Public for Surveillance and Law Enforcement

The Party is recruiting local community members to help supple-
ment  its  law  enforcement  efforts  as  well  as  maintain  political  and
social  control.  In  March  2023,  China’s  Ministry  of  Public  Security
issued a three-year action plan for strengthening the work of police
stations.312  The  plan  calls  for  cultivating  grassroots  law  enforce-
ment  personnel  who  “love  their  jobs,  perform  their  duties  loyally,
and  are  trusted  by  the  people,”  as  well  as  creating  more  “Fengq-
iao-style  police  stations,”  which  help  the  Party  maintain  social  and
political  stability.‡ 313  In  November  2023,  Radio  Free Asia  reported

* Named  after  the  Fengqiao  Township  in  Zhejiang,  the  “Fengqiao  experience”  is  an  approach
of  social  and  political  governance  promoted  by  Mao  Zedong  in  the  1960s,  which  involved  mobi-
lizing  local  people  to  target “reactionar[ies]”  and “class  enemies.”  Xi  endorsed  the  system  nearly
a decade prior to becoming paramount leader, reportedly stating during a 2003 visit to the town
as  Party  Secretary  of  Zhejiang  that  the  ‘Fengqiao  experience’  was  not  outdated.  As  paramount
leader, Xi called for the upholding and development of this system as early as 2013. Under Xi, the
system has been adapted to co-opt citizens to assist the Party in governing them to help achieve
its  objectives.  One  example  that  can  illustrate  the  contemporary  conception  of  the  “Fengqiao
experience”  is  the  Cyberspace Administration  of  China’s  creation  of  a  hotline  in April  2021  that
encourages  members  of  the  public  to  report  others  online  who  criticize  the  CCP  and  its  history.

† The  term  “Chaoyang  Masses”  is  a  related  concept  that  focuses  on  using  community  mobi-
lization  to  assist  the  Party  in  security  and  governance.  It  originally  referred  to  a  network  of
volunteers and public informants from the Chaoyang district in Beijing, but over time, the term
gradually became synonymous with forms of mass mobilization for political objectives of the CCP.
During  a  2017  tour  in  Beijing,  for  instance,  Xi  praised  groups  such  as  the  “Chaoyang  Masses”
and “Xicheng Aunties,” stating that the “cities of the people should be built and managed by the
people . . . where there are more red armbands, there is greater safety and greater peace of mind.”
The concept’s revival can be understood as the citizen-informant culture that has been developed
under  Xi.  Manoj  Kewalramani,  written  testimony  for  U.S.-China  Economic  and  Security  Review

‡ Since  2019,  there  have  been  three  batches  of “Fengqiao-style  police  stations”  that  have  been
established  across  the  country. The  stations  were  created  to  help  carry  out  the “mass  line”  con-
cept,  whereby  the  Party  organizes  citizens  to  help  achieve  its  governance  objectives,  including
public  security.  Qi  Zongzhu, “The  List  of  the Third  Batch  of  100 ‘Fengqiao-Style  Police  Stations’

that  as  part  of  this  effort,  police  stations  around  the  country  were
laying  off  auxiliary  police  officers  in  order  to  save  and  consolidate
local  resources  and  instead  outsourcing  the  daily  work  of  auxilia-
ry  police  officers  to  neighborhood  officials  and  local  militias  under
the  “grid  management” *  system.314  Although  China  has  mobilized
local  residents  en  masse  for  law  enforcement  activities  before,  the
new  plan  seeks  to  make  this  mobilization  permanent,  granting  lo-
cal officials law enforcement powers to recruit “grid officers.” 315 For
instance, in the city of Heshan, located in Guangdong Province, one
recruitment  ad  posted  on  the  city  government’s  website  said  that
grid  workers  primarily  serve  as  “information  collectors,  policy  pro-
pagandists, liaison [officers] for social situations and public opinion,
conflict  and  dispute  mediators,”  and  other  roles.316  These  workers
are  also  tasked  with  reporting  social  issues,  damage  to  public  fa-
cilities,  and  details  on  other  illegal  and  criminal  activities,  such  as
theft  or  robbery.317  According  to  an  analysis  examining  88  online
job postings from 2019 to 2020 by Jean Christopher Mittelstaedt, a
departmental lecturer in modern Chinese studies at the University
of  Oxford,  political  requirements  are “highly  important  for  aspiring
grid  members,”  as  47  recruitment  notices  mentioned  a  political  or
ideological requirement.318

So-called “vigilante groups” are also helping aid neighborhood law
enforcement efforts and assist the Party in maintaining control over
local  communities. According  to  Jessica  Batke,  the  senior  editor  for
investigations  at  ChinaFile,  Party-organized  vigilante  groups  func-
tion  “yet  another  layer—in  addition  to  the  police,  grid  workers,  fa-
cial-recognition  cameras,  and  online  monitoring  and  censorship—of
the  PRC’s  surveillance  regime.” 319  Vigilantes  appear  to  be  distin-
guished  from  grid  workers  as  civilian  volunteers,  although  these
volunteers  do  receive  some  forms  of  compensation.† 320  Grid  mem-
bers  are  employees  that  are  part  of  a  political  and  administrative
hierarchy,  bound  to  it  through  a  contract  system.321  Although  grid
workers  are  neither  public  servants  nor  attached  to  a  work  unit,
they  are  assessed  in  the  same  way  as  civil  servants.322  Vigilante
volunteers, in contrast to what their name suggests, are individuals
deemed  trustworthy  by  authorities,  working  under  the  direction  of
local  police  forces  and  the  Party-state.323  Students,  retirees,  mid-
dle-aged workers, local cadres, Party members, and veterans, among
other  demographics,  serve  as  vigilantes.324  Vigilantes  bolster  local

* According to Minxin Pei, a professor of government at Claremont McKenna College, the CCP
embraced grid management in the mid-2000s as a tool of social control. Dr. Pei asserts that grid
management  entails  dividing  communities  into  small  units  (typically  1,000  residents  per  unit)
and  equipping  them  with  information  and  surveillance  technology.  Dr.  Pei  asserts  that  although
on paper China has largely finished setting up more than one million grids in local communities,
it will likely take years to complete such a system, with only wealthy cities seeming to have made
genuine progress in the development of grid management. He argues that most grids are merely
neighborhood committees that have been relabeled. Minxin Pei, “Grid Management: China’s Lat-
est Institutional Tool of Social Control,” China Leadership Monitor, March 1, 2021, 1.

† Prospective vigilantes have been incentivized to participate by authorities through perks and
sometimes  cash  rewards.  For  instance,  one  safety  promotion  association  in  Shenzhen’s  Bao’an
district  handed  out  cash  to  people  who  could  catch  suspects.  Furthermore,  some  volunteers  may
receive  discounts  at  hotels  and  stores.  Ms.  Batke  also  notes  that  around  the  70th  anniversary
of the founding of the People’s Republic of China in 2019, one Guangdong-based vigilante group
sought to organize 300 people from different villages to assist the police with guard duty, paying
each around $21 to $25 per day. Jessica Batke, “The Police’s Strength Is Limited, but the People’s
Strength Is Boundless,” ChinaFile, June 17, 2024.

law  enforcement  efforts  by  taking  on  patrol  duties  and  handling
low-level  incidents  in  lieu  of  the  police.325 Vigilantes  are  also  used
for  Party-state  aims  to  suppress  dissent.326  For  instance,  Ms.  Bat-
ke  says  that  in  2021,  the  Nancun  Safety  Promotion  Association,  a
vigilante group based in Guangdong Province, stated that the group
should  “work  to  persuade  petitioners—individuals  seeking  redress
from  higher-level  authorities,  often  for  perceived  injustices  at  the
hands  of  local  officials—to  return  to  Nancun  from  Beijing.” 327  Fur-
thermore, the association also said it would keep 24-hour watch over
“key persons,” or people the CCP deems politically threatening.328 In
2022, the association was also directed to carry out “stability main-
tenance” activities, ranging from monitoring and managing migrant
workers to “preventing and properly resolving mass incidents,” such
as peaceful protests.329

COVID-19 Response Hones Methods for Controlling
Public Movements

China’s  response  to  the  COVID-19  pandemic  relied  on  social
and  digital  methods  to  control  the  public.330  Xi  declared  a  “peo-
ple’s  war  on  COVID”  in  February  2020,  initiating  a  nationwide
campaign  that  mobilized  all  of  the  Party-state  government,  non-
state  sector,  and  Chinese  public  to  contain  the  spread  of  the  dis-
ease.331  Essential  to  this  mass  campaign  were  the  grassroots
neighborhood organizations at the lowest level of administration,
the grid management system, throughout the country.* 332 During
the  COVID  lockdowns,  the  grid  workers  controlled  residents’  en-
try to and exit from buildings, implemented quarantines, and dis-
tributed  food  and  medicine  supplies.333  The  CCP  also  mandated
that  all  Chinese  citizens  use  health  code  apps,  which  served  as
COVID-19 health status certificates, travel passes, vaccination re-
cords, contact-tracing devices, and an apparent tool for suppress-
ing  protest  activity.† 334  Depending  on  the  color  of  one’s  health
code app, Chinese citizens were either afforded freedom of move-
ment (green) or required to quarantine (yellow or red); those with
yellow  and  red  health  codes  had  to  submit  a  negative  PCR  test
before travel restrictions could be lifted.335

Although  the  chaotic  end  of  Zero-COVID  policy  in  December
2022  demonstrated  the  dysfunction  of  CCP  decision-making  and
the limits of the Chinese public’s tolerance for extreme controls on
their movements, the grid system and digital apps have persisted
beyond the pandemic, creating latent capacity that the CCP could
use  to  reimpose  controls  on  public  movement  during  a  crisis  or
conflict if needed.336 In April 2024, the State Council and Central

* The grid management system divides cities and rural areas into areas of approximately 10,000
square meters or approximately 200–300 households. Each grid has several staff and volunteers
tasked  with  both  providing  services  and  maintain  stability  by  collecting  data,  patrolling  and
monitoring  the  community,  and  meditating  disputes.  Jean  Christopher  Mittelstaedt,  “The  Grid
Management System in Contemporary China: Grass-Roots Governance in Social Surveillance and
Service Provision,” China Information 36:1 (2022): 3-22; Jue Jiang, “A Question of Human Rights
or Human Left?—The ‘People’s War Against COVID-19’ under the ‘Gridded Management’ System
in China,” Journal of Contemporary China 31:136 (2021): 491–504.

† In June 2022, authorities in the Chinese province of Henan were suspected of restricting some
residents’  movements  using  the  COVID-related  health  apps,  following  protests  by  customers  of
rural  banks  who  had  attempted  unsuccessfully  to  make  cash  withdrawals. Tessa Wong, “Henan:
China Covid App Restricts Residents after Banking Protests,” BBC, June 14, 2022.

COVID-19 Response Hones Methods for Controlling
Public Movements—Continued
Committee  issued  rules  that  sought  to  expand,  professionalize,
and enhance the “political quality” of grassroots community work-
ers,  a  broad  category  including  grid  workers,  and  set  a  target  of
18  community  workers  for  every  10,000  residents.337  Rules  such
as these have arguably placed grassroots neighborhood organiza-
tions in what scholars Taisu Zhang and Yutian An call a state of
“permanent ‘emergency readiness,’ ” positioning them to “respond
quickly  whenever  higher  authorities  need  to  reimpose  tighter
control, perhaps even pandemic-era kinds of control.” 338

Some  cities  and  provinces  are  retaining  or  repurposing  their
COVID-era  apps  in  an  effort  to “hold  onto  the  power  and  discre-
tion  granted  to  them  under  the  COVID-sparked  ‘state  of  emer-
gency,’ ” according to Patricia M. Thornton, an Associate Professor
in  the  Department  of  Politics  and  International  Relations  at  the
University  of  Oxford.339  For  example,  the  Guangdong  Provincial
Public  Security  Department  rolled  out  a  new  WeChat  app,  the
“Ao  Residence  Code”  to  replace  its  “Ao  Health  Code”  in  Septem-
ber 2022.340 The new app, which links personal information such
as  a  resident’s  ID  number  and  address  in  a  scannable  QR  code,
is mandatory for Guangdong-based household registration certifi-
cate holders, migrants, and foreign residents.341 Dr. Thornton ob-
serves that the app “allows users to enter libraries, museums, and
hospitals,  effectively  granting  access  to  public  spaces  and  ‘bun-
dled  conveniences’  to  an  officially  recognized  subset  of  residents,
while providing local officials with an easy means of excluding at
will objectionable ‘key populations’ from public places.” 342

Education Campaigns Emphasize National Security and Patriotism
National  security  education  has  gained  increasing  prominence
under  Xi’s  rule,  highlighting  security  as  a  key  priority  for  the  Par-
ty-state. As noted previously, in April 2014, Xi proposed the concept
of  “Comprehensive  National  Security”  at  the  first  meeting  of  the
Central  National  Security  Commission,  which  was  closely  followed
by  the  adoption  of  the  National  Security  Law  in  July  2015.343 The
law stipulated that the state would incorporate national security ed-
ucation into the country’s education system and the training system
for civil servants.344 The law also designated April 15th as National
Security  Education  Day,  with  the  first  one  being  held  in  2016.* 345
In a recent article published on National Security Education Day in
2024, MSS Secretary Chen Yixin emphasizes the importance of ideo-
logical  security,  saying  the  Party  and  people  must “guard  the  ideo-
logical  position,  oppose  and  resist  all  kinds  of  erroneous  thoughts,
resist and guard against the infiltration of religious extremism, and
strictly  prevent  all  kinds  of  risks  from  spreading  to  the  political
security field.” 346

China  has  also  promoted  national  security  as  a  cross-disci-
plinary  field  of  study  in  recent  years,  opening  new  specialized
research centers, programs, and funds.347 China’s Ministry of Ed-
ucation  first  announced  a  plan  to  set  up  national  security  stud-
ies  departments  in  universities  across  the  country  in  2018.348  In
December  2020,  the  Academic  Degrees  Committee  of  the  State
Council  and  the  Ministry  of  Education  finalized  the  creation  of
a  new “interdisciplinary”  education  category,  which  included “na-
tional  security  studies”  as  a  formal  topic.349  In  2021,  the  China
Institutes  of  Contemporary  International  Relations  (CICIR),  a
think  tank  linked  to  the  MSS,  opened  the  Research  Center  for
Comprehensive  National  Security.350  CICIR  has  also  released
publications  on  national  security,  and  the  think  tank’s  president,
Yuan Peng, held trainings for cadres at different government lev-
els  on  the  issue.351  In  December  2023,  the  South  China  Morn-
ing  Post  also  reported  that  in  the  previous  five  years,  more  than
a  dozen  Chinese  universities  had  established  national  security
studies departments.352 According to Ms. Drinhausen and Helena
Legarda,  both  of  the  Mercator  Institute  for  China  Studies,  these
efforts are part of a broader attempt by the CCP to “future-proof
the  party  state  against  domestic  resistance,  [as]  the  leadership
places  a  strong  focus  on  inoculating  China’s  next  generation
against  harmful  influences.” 353

China  has  also  worked  on  expanding  and  codifying  its  patri-
otic  education  campaign  in  recent  years  to  consolidate  support
around  the  Party.  The  patriotic  education  campaign  has  been  a
longstanding feature of Chinese schooling, having been instituted
at  large  scale  in  the  1990s.354 The  main  features  of  patriotic  ed-
ucation in China center around incorporating material related to
national concepts of patriotism, such as the CCP’s vision of histo-
ry and traditional culture, as well as emphasizing political loyalty
to the Party.355 Since 2016, a series of directives and opinions for
enhancing  patriotic  education  have  been  issued  by  the  Ministry
of  Education,  merging  patriotic  themes  into  exams  and  course-
work  across  subjects  and  adding  Xi  Jinping Thought  to  all  grade
levels’  curricula  in  2021.356  In  a  more  recent  development,  the
Patriotic  Education  Law  was  passed  in  October  2023,  mandating
that  love  of  the  Party  and  motherland  must  take  place  not  only
in  schools  but  also  across  society,  including  various  government
departments,  enterprises,  united  front  groups,  and  within  fami-
lies.357  The  law  also  emphasized  the  CCP’s  desire  to  strengthen
publicity  and  education  on  unifying  with  Taiwan  and  opposing
Taiwanese  independence.358

Party-State  Stokes  Fears  of  Foreign  Espionage,  Foreign

Contacts

China’s national security propaganda increasingly raises the spec-
ter of foreign spies and is creating an atmosphere where citizens are
encouraged  to  be  hypervigilant  about  interactions  with  foreigners.
This  trend  has  manifested  in  the  increasingly  active  social  media
presence  of  China’s  chief  spy  agency  and  a  slew  of  measures  that
appear intended to hinder contact with foreigners.

500

MSS Goes Online to Raise Alarm about Foreign Espionage

The  MSS  launched  its  social  media  presence  on  WeChat  in  July
2023,  transforming  itself  into  a  highly  visible  presence  imploring
Chinese  citizens  to  join  its  fight  against  foreign  espionage.  Its  first
post emphasized that counterespionage requires the mobilization of
all of society, offering citizens rewards and promises of protection for
reporting  espionage  threats  through  tip  lines.359  The  MSS  account
posts  frequently,  often  describing  the  details  of  supposed  espionage
activities or recruitment efforts by the U.S. and British intelligence
services.360  It  tries  to  make  its  propaganda  engaging,  using  short
videos  and  comic  strips  to  convey  warnings  that  China  is  facing
omnipresent espionage threats.361

Notably, the MSS is also using its online presence to combat neg-
ative  narratives  about  China’s  economy  and  emphasize  the  impor-
tance  of  data  protection.  Following  the  December  2023  Economic
Work  Conference,  the  MSS  account  made  a  post  describing  foreign
assessments  of  China’s  slowing  economy  as  an  attempt  by  exter-
nal  forces  to  contain  China’s  development.362  In  January  2024,  the
MSS’s WeChat account published a comic depicting foreign spies at-
tempting to access secrets related to the rare earths industry.363 In
March 2024, the MSS released a propaganda video warning compa-
nies not to allow foreign due diligence firms to investigate them.364
In  May  2024,  the  MSS  also  used  its WeChat  account  to  accuse  for-
eign  academics,  universities,  and  NGOs  of  illegally  collecting  geo-
graphic  and  biological  data  from  nature  reserves,  claiming  in  one
case  that  a  foreign  NGO  had  helped “a  certain Western  country”  to
“steal core, sensitive data.” 365

Suppressing Foreign Contacts

China’s  government  has  taken  other  measures  to  control  its
population’s  contacts  with  foreigners.  Supplementing  nation-
al-level  laws  discussed  above,  provinces  have  issued  further  reg-
ulations,  as  in  the  case  of  Chongqing,  which  issued  implementa-
tion  regulations  for  the  Counterespionage  Law  requiring  strict
oversight of government and SOE employees’ travel overseas and
of institutions engaged in foreign exchange or travel, among oth-
er  provisions.366  Reporting  in  mid-July  2024  also  suggests  that
some localities increased travel restrictions on students, teachers,
and  banking  sector  staff  ahead  of  the  summer  vacation.367  Some
Chinese  nationals  have  also  experienced  retaliation  for  meeting
with foreigners. Dong Yuyu, editor of the CCP newspaper Guang-
ming  Daily,  was  arrested  in  April  2023  for  meeting  a  Japanese
diplomat  at  a  restaurant.368  In  late  2023,  the  Chinese  wife  of  a
U.S.  citizen  was  detained  and  accused  of  providing  state  secrets
to  overseas  parties  after  briefly  doing  administrative  work  for  a
U.S.  logistics  firm.369

China  also  appears  to  be  increasing  its  restrictions  on  contract
between foreign diplomats and Chinese citizens within the country.
China’s  regulation  of  foreign  diplomatic  activity  within  its  borders
has  always  been  restrictive,  requiring  advance  notification  and  of-
ten  permission  in  order  for  diplomats  to  meet  with  provincial  or
local  officials  and  placing  strict  geographical  limits  on  diplomats’

501

travel.* 370  Yet  in  2024,  U.S.  Ambassador  to  China  Nicholas  Burns
stated that China’s government had also begun disinviting U.S. Em-
bassy  staff  from  university  fairs  they  had  previously  attended,  cit-
ing  national  security  reasons.† 371  There  is  also  new  evidence  that
China is applying pressure on its own population, with Ambassador
Burns  stating  that  Chinese  nationals  are  pressured  not  to  attend
U.S.  Embassy  events,‡  and  EU  Ambassador  to  China  Jorge  Toledo
stating  that  China  now  often  withholds  permission  for  academics
and students to meet with EU diplomatic staff.372 (For more on the
Chinese government’s recent efforts to restrict people-to-people ties
within China despite an agreement with the United States to deep-
en  them,  see  Chapter  2,  “U.S.-China  Security  and  Foreign  Affairs
(Year in Review).”)

China  Refines  Capabilities  and  Processes  for  Military

Mobilization

There  is  ample  evidence  that  China’s  armed  forces  are  enhanc-
ing their general military preparedness but little evidence they are
mobilizing  for  an  imminent  conflict  at  this  time.373  Dr.  Heath  ar-
gued  in  testimony  before  the  Commission  that  observers  should  be
careful to distinguish between “normal” activities that all militaries
undertake  to  carry  out  their  assigned  missions  and  the  series  of
abnormal,  costly,  disruptive  activities  that  would  need  to  occur  for
the  People’s  Liberation  Army  (PLA)  to  transition  from  peacetime
to  a  war  footing.§ 374  He  stated  that  much  of  the  evidence  cited  for
the  claim  that  China  is  preparing  for  imminent  conflict—such  as
new weapons procurement and increased defense spending—is more
accurately  characterized  as  evidence  of  military  preparedness,  and
crucial steps to mobilize Chinese society for war—such as mass call-
ups  of  its  conscripts  and  the  large-scale  transfer  of  resources  from
civilian to military use—have not occurred.375

programs have pulled out over the past two years due to pressure from authorities, schools, and
employers.  Jonathan  Cheng,  “In  Rare  Rebuke,  U.S.  Ambassador  Accuses  China  of  Undermining
Diplomacy,” Wall Street Journal, June 25, 2024.

‡ Ambassador Burns said China’s MSS or other government bodies had pressured Chinese cit-
izens  not  to  go,  or  attempted  to  intimidate  those  who  attended,  in  the  case  of  at  least  61  public
events since November 2023. Jonathan Cheng, “In Rare Rebuke, U.S. Ambassador Accuses China
of Undermining Diplomacy,” Wall Street Journal, June 25, 2024.

§ According  to  Dr.  Heath,  normal  activities  associated  with  “military  preparedness”  include
investments  in  and  development  of  new  weapons  and  equipment,  recruitment  and  training  of
personnel, and planning and preparation for contingencies. He states that “military preparedness
is  a  normal  activity  undertaken  regardless  of  whether  a  country’s  leadership  believes  a  war  is
likely or not.” By contrast, Dr. Heath argues that more reliable indicators that China is preparing
for  conflict  would  be  activities  associated  with  “national  defense  mobilization”  or  “national  war
preparation,”  terms  similar  to  the  phrases  the  PLA  itself  uses  to  describe  two  forms  of  prepara-
tion  for  conflict  (“war  mobilization”  战争动员  and  “war  preparation”  战争准备).  National  defense
mobilization  consists  of  “state-directed  activity  to  transition  part  or  all  of  the  country  from  a
peacetime  to  war  footing  through  such  measures  as  conscription  and  the  large-scale  transfer  of
resources  from  civilian  to  military  use.”  He  notes  that  national  defense  mobilization  can  great-
ly  improve  a  state’s  war-making  capacity,  but  it  is  also  “enormously  costly  and  disruptive  and,
therefore,  rarely  undertaken  outside  a  conflict.”  By  contrast,  the  national  war  preparation  con-
sists  of  “changes  to  policy  and  procedures  in  nonmilitary  domains  to  facilitate  the  execution  of
combat  operations”  and  can  occur  in  peacetime  or  wartime. “Although  national  war  preparation
is  less  disruptive  and  costly  than  mobilization,  it  still  is  premised  on  an  expectation  of  conflict,”
Dr.  Heath  observes. “Thus,  it  is  inherently  more  political  and  potentially  controversial  in  a  way
that  military  preparedness  is  not.”  Timothy  Heath,  written  testimony  for  U.S.-China  Economic
and Security Review Commission, Hearing on China’s Stockpiling and Mobilization Measures for
Competition and Conflict, June 13, 2024, 2–3.

Some  of  the  improvements  China  has  made  to  its  mobilization
capabilities and processes  over the past ten  years  do merit concern
and  greater  scrutiny,  however,  because  their  cumulative  effect  has
been to improve the speed with which the armed forces can mobilize
and  the  ease  with  which  they  can  requisition  civilian  resources.  In
particular, China has passed new measures to improve the processes
for  mobilizing  available  manpower,  revitalized  its  militias,  stream-
lined the bureaucracy responsible for defense mobilization, honed its
armed  forces’  skills  through  emergency  response  activities,  and  en-
hanced the Chinese public’s familiarity with defense matters and air
raid shelters. At minimum, these reforms have likely given Chinese
leaders “moderate  and  increasing  confidence  in  the  system’s  ability
to  perform  during  a  conflict,”  Devin Thorne,  a  Principal Threat  In-
telligence Analyst at Recorded Future, testified before the Commis-
sion.376 At maximum, these measures can be read as gradual—and
purposely  less  detectable—steps  to  position  the  armed  forces  for  a
smooth transition to a war footing, should China’s leadership direct
them to do so. All in all, it is clear China is more ready now than it
was  five  years  ago  to  launch  a  war  at  short  notice,  and  the  United
States will have less time to identify the warning signs than before.

China Takes Steps to Ensure Manpower Availability

China  has  refined  its  system  for  calling  up  conscripts  and  re-
serves  to  ensure  it  can  access  a  sizeable  pool  of  manpower,  like-
ly  motivated  by  longstanding  military  readiness  concerns  as  well
as  by  the  CCP’s  observation  of  Russia’s  manpower  issues  amid  its
war  with  Ukraine.377  Like  the  PLA,*  the  Russian  military  has  fo-
cused its modernization efforts on creating a smaller, higher-quality
force,  which  ran  into  manpower  issues  as  the  high-intensity  con-
flict  became  protracted.378  PLA  observers  note  that  Russia  found
it  required  more  troops  for  the  campaign  than  originally  anticipat-
ed  and  needed  to  increase  personnel  numbers  by  adjusting  its  con-
scription  policy  and  its  defense  mobilization  system.379  Moreover,
the announcement of a partial mobilization by the Russian govern-
ment  led  to  an  exodus  of  young  men  from  the  country,  prompting
the  Russian  government  to  de-publicize  its  conscription  efforts  and
focus on the conscription of rural Russians.380 China’s changes to its
conscription  and  reservist  policies  are  intended  to  preempt  some  of
these problems, which could just as well emerge in the context of a
high-intensity war over Taiwan.

Changes  to  Conscription  Policy  Aim  to  Boost  Quality  of  Conscripts,

Speed of Wartime Mobilization

Changes  to  PLA  conscription  policy  are  intended  to  enhance  the
quality of conscripts and to streamline the process by which they are
mobilized in wartime.† In 2023, the PLA updated its 2001 “Regula-

* China’s  longstanding  modernization  effort  has  focused  on  professionalizing  the  military  and
increasing the quality and technical proficiency of troops, resulting in a reduction in numbers of
active-duty troops by design and by dint of recruitment and retention struggles. Kenneth W. Allen
et  al.,  “Personnel  of  the  People’s  Liberation  Army,”  BluePath  Labs  (Prepared  for  the  U.S.-China
Economic and Security Review Commission), November 3, 2022, 8, 24, 39.

† It is estimated that about 700,000 personnel out of the PLA’s two million active-duty person-
nel  are  conscripts,  who  are  obliged  to  perform  two  years  of  mandatory  service.  Conscripts  are
considered  to  be  the  least  trained  and  capable  troops  in  the  PLA  but  are  considered  necessary
for  manpower-intensive  missions  such  as  ground  combat.  Over  the  past  two  decades,  the  PLA

tions on Conscription Work,” with official Xinhua coverage asserting
that  the  changes  would  improve  the  overall  quality  of  conscripts
within  the  PLA,  standardize  procedures,  clearly  delegate  responsi-
bilities,  create  a  fast  and  efficient  conscription  system  capable  of
transitioning  between  peace  and  wartime,  and  provide  for  military
personnel  replenishment.381 The  regulations  appear  to  place  great-
er  priority  on  recruiting  more  educated  personnel,  call  on  colleges
to  assist  in  military  conscription  work,  and  offer  incentives  for  col-
lege-educated  recruits.382  In  a  change  from  the  2001  version,  the
new regulations also specifically include wartime provisions that al-
low  the  Central  Military  Commission  (CMC)  to  adjust  conscription
requirements “according  to  wartime  needs”  after  issuing  a  national
defense  mobilization  order.383  These  provisions  give  the  CMC  the
legal  authority  to  loosen  conscription  criteria  as  needed  and  make
more  of  China’s  populace  eligible  for  conscription  into  the  PLA.384
The  2023  regulations  also  state  that  former  soldiers  should  be  pri-
oritized  for  recruitment  in  wartime  and  offer  incentives  for  retired
conscripts  who  did  not  initially  meet  the  criteria  for  promotion  the
chance to re-enlist at a higher rank during peacetime.* 385 Enhanc-
ing the PLA’s ability to call up former soldiers and conscripts would
be a straightforward way to build up force numbers in an emergen-
cy.386

Reservist Changes

China  has  refined  the  bureaucratic  system  for  the  PLA’s  esti-
mated  510,000  reserve  personnel  and  sought  to  improve  the  at-
tractiveness  of  reserve  duty  through  the  passage  of  a  Reservists
Law  in  2022.† 387  The  law  clarifies  the  division  of  responsibility
for  reservist  work  among  various  departments  of  the  CMC,  nam-
ing  the  National  Defense  Mobilization  Department  as  responsi-
ble  for  assigning  reservists  to  units  and  calling  them  up  when
needed.388 The  law  also  introduces  increased  benefits  to  enhance
the  attractiveness  of  reserve  duty,  including  financial  aid,  subsi-
dies  for  essentials  like  food  and  transportation,  and  entitlement

China Seeks to Adapt Militias to Demands of Modern Warfare

China has revitalized its militia system over the past decade, tar-
geting  skilled  professionals  in  high-tech  industries  and  improving

has sought to recruit better educated and more technically skilled people into the enlisted force,
but  it  will  conscript  high  school  and  ninth  grade-educated  personnel  where  it  fails  to  fill  volun-
tary quotas. Kenneth W. Allen et al., “Personnel of the People’s Liberation Army,” BluePath Labs

* The PLA continues to experience retention issues, particularly with enlisted conscripts. Since
2021, the PLA has offered conscripts incentives to take a “second enlistment” after their two-year
initial  service  period  has  expired.  Kenneth W. Allen  et  al., “Personnel  of  the  People’s  Liberation
Army,” BluePath Labs (Prepared for the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission),

† “Reservists”  are  defined  by  law  as  Chinese  citizens  aged  18  or  older  who  are  either  “pre-
assigned”  to  active-duty  units  in  the  PLA  or  are  assigned  to  units  made  entirely  of  reservists.
Reservists  include  both  enlisted  personnel  and  officers.  During  wartime,  PLA  reservists  serve
as  an  “important  source”  of  supplementary  officers  and  enlisted  personnel.  Reservists  are  to  be
sourced primarily from former PLA active-duty personnel and technicians, with a minimum ser-
vice requirement of four years for new reservists. Center for Naval Analysis, “PLA Update: March

the  training  that  militia  members  receive.* 390  In  wartime,  militia
units  assist  the  PLA  with  military  operations  and  provide  support
and  additional  manpower;  in  peacetime,  militia  units  assist  in  hu-
manitarian  aid  and  disaster  relief,  support  military  training,  and
contribute  to  internal  security  activities.† 391  Militia  personnel  re-
tain  their  civilian  jobs  during  peacetime,  and  many  are  employed
in  nonstate  enterprises.‡  Mr.  Thorne  testified  that  “militias  are  an
outcome  of  the  [military  civil  fusion]  MCF  strategy  that  seeks  to
locate and make use of military-relevant resources and skills within
the PRC’s civilian economic and social base.” 392

China  is  increasingly  forming  specialized “new-type  militia”  forc-
es  to  leverage  civilian  technical  talent  in  specialized  technology  ar-
eas  for  the  needs  of  modern  warfare,  although  practical  problems
with their incorporation remain. According to Mr. Thorne, “new-type
militias”  are “armed  forces  units  established  among  civilian  profes-
sionals,  including  those  from  the  private  sector,”  but  they  can  also
be  established  in  SOEs  and  universities.§ 393  The  professionals  in
“new-type militias” may be drawn from industries such as informa-
tion  technology,  communications,  cybersecurity,  software,  electron-
ics,  robotics,  unmanned  systems,  and  artificial  intelligence,  among
others.394  They  may  be  assigned  to  units  focused  on  cyber  offense
and  defense,  online  information  control,  intelligence  support,  drone
operations, maritime search and rescue, and undersea target detec-
tion, among others.395 “New type” militias are not always embraced
by  the  private  enterprises  in  which  they  are  embedded,  however.
According  to  Mr. Thorne,  militias  face  practical  problems  such  as  a
lack  of  complex  and  standardized  training,  insufficient  equipment,
and the reluctance and noncompliance of enterprises to commit often
valuable personnel and equipment to militia responsibilities.396 For

* The  People’s  Militia  (民兵)  is  one  of  the  three  branches  of  China’s  armed  forces,  along  with
the  PLA  and  the  People’s Armed  Police  (PAP). At  the  national  level,  the  Central  Military  Com-
mission’s  National  Defense  Mobilization  Department  Militia  Reserve  Bureau  (民兵预备役局)
manages  militia-related  policies,  procedures,  and  requirements.  Militias  are  established  under
the  Provincial  Military  District  system  and  are  managed  by  the  People’s Armed  Forces  Depart-
ments (PAFDs, 人民武装部) at the county level and below. There are county-level PAFDs manned
by  active-duty  PLA  personnel  and  grassroots  PAFDs  manned  by  civilian  cadres  whose  salaries
are  paid  by  local  governments  and  sometimes  work  on  a  part-time  basis.  Devin Thorne,  written

† In  the  case  of  a  conflict,  the  2020  edition  of  the  PLA  textbook  Science  of  Military  Strategy
emphasizes the importance of rapid mobilization in order to make effective use of militia forces.
The Science of Military Strategy identifies rear-echelon duties for the militia such as conducting
transportation, resupply, rescue,  repair,  intelligence,  and  communication support operations. The
Science  of  Military  Strategy  further  notes  that  the  militia  can  be  assigned  to  perform  combat
duties independently or in support of active-duty PLA personnel. China Aerospace Studies Insti-
tute, “In Their Own Words: Science of Military Strategy 2020,” NDU Press, January 2022, 441.

‡ In  2016,  Chinese  media  claimed  that  114  private  enterprises  had  established  PAFDs  and
more than 1,000 private enterprises had established militia units, though Mr. Thorne notes that
the  total  number  of  militia  working  in  the  civilian  economy  is  unknown.  Devin Thorne,  written

example,  some  technology  companies  have  reportedly  established
militia  units  from  non-technical  sales  staff  and  members  of  compa-
ny  Party  organizations—instead  of  from  specialized  personnel—to
ensure  the  absence  of  staff  for  militia  training  does  not  undermine
productivity.397

China  has  sought  to  address  these  problems  with  improvements
to  training  and  incentives.398  According  to  Mr.  Thorne,  some  local
authorities  have  instituted  consultative  mechanisms  and  reduced
the  disruptiveness  of  training  to  improve  the  participation  of  tech-
nology enterprises in militia enrollment efforts.399 He noted one re-
port  of  a  district  in  Shenzhen,  Guangdong,  that  promised  to  offer
housing  and  economic  assistance  to  non-state  enterprises  that  es-
tablished  militias.400  Efforts  are  underway  to  improve  the  content
and  manner  of  militia  training,  and  militia  units  are  now  training
more  frequently  with  the  PLA  theater  commands  and  the  services
than they did before.401

Streamlining the National Defense Mobilization System

China’s  national  defense  mobilization  system  has  historically
suffered  from  several  flaws,  which  have  prompted  a  number  of  re-
forms  under  General  Secretary  Xi  over  the  past  decade  to  improve
it.402  Critically,  local  governments  were  reluctant  to  share  the  bur-
den  of  peacetime  administrative  work  with  the  PLA  and  opted  to
prioritize  economic  projects  that  could  stimulate  GDP  growth  over
defense  mobilization  projects.403  Another  problem  was  a  lack  of
clarity  regarding  the  roles  and  responsibilities  within  the  national
defense  mobilization  bureaucracy.404  For  example,  one  PLA  source
from  2018  noted  a  lack  of  clear  policies  for  coordinating  work  and
a common problem of organizations failing to even maintain an ac-
curate list of their leadership.405 It even recounts an “embarrassing
scene”  of  a  critical  staff  member  at  the  municipal  level  who  was
unable  to  name  the  units  of  his  own  organization  or  explain  his
own  responsibilities,  noting  that  this  situation  was “not  an  isolated
case.” 406 Finally, civilian transportation infrastructure often did not
meet military specifications, which could restrict the  ability of  PLA
equipment  to  be  transported  via  civilian  assets  in  a  mobilization
scenario.407  Such  deficiencies  helped  spur  a  series  of  reforms  in  ar-
eas such as the national defense mobilization system’s bureaucratic
structure, information collection system, and relevant laws.

Improved  Coordination  through  National  Defense  Mobilization

Offices

Structural  changes  to  China’s  national  defense  mobilization  sys-
tem,  most  importantly  the  establishment  of  National  Defense  Mo-
bilization  (NDM)  Offices,  have  mitigated  longstanding  difficulties
in  division  of  labor  between  the  PLA  and  state  governments.  The
national  defense  mobilization  system  consists  of  National  Defense
Mobilization Commissions (NDMCs) at the national, provincial, mu-
nicipal,  and  county  levels  that  are  each  jointly  led  by  civilian  and
military  authorities  under  the  leadership  of  the  CCP.* 408  In  2022,

* NDMCs  are  supported  by  national  defense  mobilization “working  offices”  that  perform  work
related  to  specific  elements  of  national  defense  mobilization.  An  individual  office  will  provide
guidance,  develop  capacity,  and  align  military  requirements  with  available  resources  in  its  area
of  specialization.  These  offices  are  staffed  by  various  civilian  and  military  organizations,  and

506

new civilian organizations called National Defense Mobilization Of-
fices  were  established  within  local  governments  at  subnational  lev-
els  to  take  over  administrative  matters  that  had  previously  been
managed by the PLA’s provincial military regions.409 As Mr. Thorne
explains,  locating  these  new  offices  within  the  local  governments,
specifically  local  Development  Reform  Commissions,  helps  “institu-
tionalize the mandate” that civilian authorities focused on economic
planning must consider national defense mobilization requirements
in their work.410 In addition, these new NDM offices also contribut-
ed to better coordination between government and military branch-
es of the bureaucracy by forming “joint offices” for subnational-level
NDMCs to coordinate with the local PLA mobilization bureaus.411

China Deploys Surveys to Identify National Defense Resources across

Its Vast Economy

China’s  “national  defense  potential  surveys”  have  sought  to  help
authorities identify resources throughout China’s economy that can
be  utilized  during  a  crisis,  but  they  have  historically  faced  short-
comings in their reliability.412 Efforts to collect, maintain, and verify
records  of  the  resources  are  crucial  for  the  NDM  system,  making
national defense potential surveys an important tool for developing
insights  into  existing  resources.413  The  surveying  process  involves
the PLA defining its requirements and government agencies imple-
menting  the  surveys  through  national  defense  mobilization  offic-
es.414 Further assistance is provided by government statistical offic-
es  and  NDM  working  offices  at  and  above  the  county  level.415 The
surveys  are  conducted  on  an  annual,  monthly,  and  ad  hoc  basis.416
Military  authorities  gain  data  from  local  governments,  enterprises,
working units, and social organizations, which provide insights into
the  type,  quantity,  and  quality  of  resources  that  are  available.417
However,  Mr.  Thorne  asserts  that  “like  other  aspects  of  the  NDM
system,  national  defense  potential  survey  work  has  been  impaired
by  many  problems  for  a  long  time.” 418  Some  of  these  problems  in-
clude  ill-defined  responsibilities  among  government  and  military
organizations,  overreliance  on  the  military  and  passivity  among
government  officials,  unwillingness  (in  violation  of  the  law)  on  the
part  of  some  organizations  to  fully  disclose  relevant  information,
low-skill workforces that are tasked with data collection and verifi-
cation, and the treatment of national defense potential data surveys
as a formality.419

In  recent  years,  China  has  sought  to  improve  the  survey  process
through  the  adoption  of  improved  information  technologies—efforts
that  have  yielded  moderately  successful  results.420  For  instance,

their  configuration  is  not  uniform  across  NDMCs.  The  national-level  NDMC,  for  example,  has
six working offices. Some PLA sources suggest that many local-level NDMCs have eight working
offices.  Devin Thorne,  written  testimony  for  U.S.-China  Economic  and  Security  Review  Commis-

in  2018,  the  CMC  National  Defense  Mobilization  Department  im-
plemented  a  new  set  of  annual  national  defense  potential  data  au-
diting  practices  to  address  issues  of  data  quality,  reliability,  and
specificity.421  In  2021,  the  CMC’s  National  Defense  Mobilization
Department  also  rolled  out  a  new  indexing  system  for  cataloging
over  4,000  military  and  civilian  resources  that  the  Party-state  and
PLA  can  bring  to  bear  during  wartime  mobilization.* 422  The  new
survey  guidance  allegedly  improved  the  quality  of  the  reported  na-
tional  defense  potential  data  based  on  an  annual  audit  conducted
after  the  implementation  of  the  new  survey  guidance,  but  calls  to
continue improving the indexing system, particularly with regard to
resources in emerging domains, continued in 2021.423 Furthermore,
there  have  been  efforts  to  implement  data-driven  and  networked
solutions to improve data collection as well as resource tracking and
tasking.424  For  instance,  a  January  2023  Ningxia  Military  District
training event demonstrated use of a “national defense mobilization
comprehensive  information  system,”  and  a  “veterans  information
management  system,”  among  others.425  Mr.  Thorne  argues,  howev-
er,  that  as  of  early  2022,  “the  overall  effort  to  modernize  national
defense  potential  data  management  with  information  technology
was  likely  impeded  by  poor  integration,  with  different  information
systems using different standards and interfaces,” further asserting
that the implementation of technology solutions at the county level
was also likely incomplete as of mid-2023.426

Chinese  Laws  Enable  the  Party-State  to  Requisition  Civilian Assets

for National Defense

China  has  institutionalized  its  ability  to  mobilize  nonstate  re-
sources by enshrining the Party-state’s powers into law. Through the
Chinese  constitution,  the  2010  National  Defense  Mobilization  Law,
and  other  regulations  such  as  the  2015  National  Security  Law,  the
Party-state  may  requisition  virtually  any  nonstate  resource  in  the
context  of “public  interest”  and “national  defense  requirements.” 427
Furthermore, Chinese scholars have said that the state may be able
to requisition moveable, immovable, and intangible property, as well
as personal labor, goods, and materials that are yet to be produced.428
Under  the  2000  Foreign  Enterprise  Law,  the  state  may  requisition
foreign-owned  property  and,  “under  special  circumstances,”  appro-
priate foreign-invested enterprises.429 The 2019 regulations govern-
ing  civilian  transportation  national  defense  mobilization  allows  the
owners  of  a  requisitioned  resource  to  receive  compensation  if  the
resource  is  damaged  or  modified  during  national  defense  construc-
tion or military activities.430 Under the regulations, people or orga-
nizations  that  own  or  manage  civilian  transportation  tools,  includ-
ing  ports,  airports,  and  train  stations,  will  be  compensated  if  they
suffer  damage  or  depreciation,  and  the  state  will  likely  cover  the
salaries of operating and support personnel.† 431 Foreign enterprises

* The indexing system is divided into nine categories, each with various subclasses of resources.
For  instance,  the “national  economy  class”  includes  subclasses  of  resources  including  major  and
supplemental foodstuffs, fuel logistics resources, medicine and healthcare resources, nuclear and
chemical  disaster  emergency  response  resources,  and  others.  Devin  Thorne,  written  testimony
for  U.S.-China  Economic  and  Security  Review  Commission,  Hearing  on  China’s  Stockpiling  and
Mobilization Measures for Competition and Conflict, June 13, 2024, 26–27.

† The  requisition  of  civilian  resources  has  remained  a  point  of  contention  among  PLA  experts
along  with  other  aspects  of  the  NDM  system.  For  instance,  in  2021,  a  professor  and  graduate

508

may also be entitled to compensation in the context of expropriation
under special circumstances.432

In  recent  years,  China  has  sought  to  ensure  that  its  transpor-
tation  infrastructure  is  compatible  with  national  defense  require-
ments  through  the  National  Defense  Transportation  Law  (NDTL).
According  to  Mr.  Thorne,  “The  NDTL  has  likely  eased  some  of  the
difficulties  that  military  authorities  previously  faced  in  adding  na-
tional  defense  requirements  to  transportation  infrastructure  con-
struction  plans.” 433  The  Party-state  implemented  the  National  De-
fense Transportation Law in 2017,* which sought to strengthen the
legal  basis  for  ensuring  the  military  has  access  to  and  can  make
use  of  China’s  transportation  infrastructure.434  The  law  requires
the  State  Council  to  consult  with  the  PLA  regarding  national  de-
fense transportation planning and technical standards, and it estab-
lished  consultation  mechanisms  between  civilian  government  and
PLA  units  at  the  provincial  level  and  above  to  coordinate  plans  for
transportation  projects.435  The  law  seeks  to  ensure  that  the  plan-
ning,  construction,  and  use  of  railroads,  roads,  waterways,  airways,
pipelines, and postal services, among other forms of infrastructure,†
are  compatible  with  national  defense  transportation  requirements,
and provide priority access to China’s armed forces.436 Various Chi-
nese  cities  and  provinces  have  reported  increased  compliance  with
the law. For instance, in April 2020, a state-owned railway operator
agreed not to demolish an out-of-service track connecting Anhui and
Guangxi  Provinces  due  to  its  military  value,  and  it  also  added  new
military-use stations, ration supply stations, and other military-use
improvements to its lines.437 In December 2020, a Qingdao port re-
ported  building  a  military-civilian  dual-use  terminal  for  naval  ves-
sels  and  large  civilian  roll-on/roll-off  ships,  a  large  assembly  area,
and water and power supply facilities.438

Although the National Defense Transportation Law has likely im-
proved  adherence  to  these  requirements,  problems  and  limitations
still  remain.439  In  March  2024,  participants  at  a  forum  on  NDM
hosted by the National Defense University Joint Operations College
expressed dissatisfaction with the ambiguous responsibilities of dif-
ferent  parties  in  implementing  national  defense  requirements  for

student  at  the Army  Command  College  argued  that  the  specifics  of  the  process  are  not  defined
by law and suggested improving incentives for supporting requisitions as well as issuing punish-
ments  for  obstructing  them.  PLA  experts  have  also  discussed  issues  of  ambiguity  and  diverging
interests in how compensation could be implemented, while others have argued that the military
should have the latitude to approve decisions about the requisition of civilian resources indepen-
dent  of  the  government.  Devin Thorne,  written  testimony  for  U.S.-China  Economic  and  Security
Review Commission, Hearing on China’s Stockpiling and Mobilization Measures for Competition
and Conflict, June 13, 2024, 13.

* The National Defense Transportation Law stipulates that governments at or above the county
level  may  “requisition  civilian  transportation  vehicles,  transportation  facilities,  transportation
materials  and  other  civilian  transportation  resources  based  on  the  needs  of  national  defense.”
The National Defense Law includes a clause allowing the state to “expropriate or requisition the
equipment,  facilities,  means  of  transportation,  premises,  and  other  properties  of  organizations
and individuals in accordance with the law for the purpose of national defense mobilization.” Law
of the People’s Republic of China on National Defense (China), 2020; National Defense Transpor-
tation Law of the People’s Republic of China (China), 2017.

† The  law  asserts  that  the  state  and  military  develop  a  catalog  of  projects  required  to  imple-
ment  national  defense  requirements.  The  2016  version  of  this  catalog  includes  railways,  road-
ways,  airports,  ports,  and  refined  oil  pipelines  as  well  as  fixed,  mobile,  satellite,  and  broadcast
communications systems; data centers and data exchange platforms of government departments;
geopolitical, meteorological, and hydrological information systems; radio frequencies; and civil air
defense  infrastructure.  Devin  Thorne,  written  testimony  for  U.S.-China  Economic  and  Security

building  infrastructure  such  as  roads,  bridges,  and  ports.440  Other
issues that have impacted the transportation sector’s ability to meet
national  defense  requirements  include  cost  and  bureaucracy  issues
impeding efforts to retro fit existing civilian ships and airport facil-
ities.441  Furthermore,  underfunding  and  poor-quality  training  pro-
grams have beset railway national defense transportation teams.442
Mr.  Thorne  asserts  that  “a  more  wholistic  assessment  of  how  the
NDTL  has  been  implemented  in  the  context  of  preparing  transpor-
tation  networks  for  NDM  requires  more  research,”  as  implementa-
tion efforts have been inconsistently present in national and subna-
tional transportation-focused five-year plans.443

China’s Transportation System Would Reveal Wartime
Mobilization
Civilian transportation networks will be essential to PLA oper-
ations in wartime, and changes in patterns of activity on China’s
transportation networks could provide advanced warning of mili-
tary action against Taiwan. According to estimates from the PLA
Logistics  Academic  Research  Center,  a  large-scale  PLA  joint  op-
eration  would  require  approximately “3,000  train  trips,  1  million
vehicle  trips,  2,100  aircraft  sorties,  15  oil  pipeline  battalions . . .
and  more  than  8,000  ship  voyages.” 444  According  to  Mr.  Thorne,
the military’s use of the transportation sector would likely result
in “large disruptions in civilian passenger and cargo flights as the
military amasses required materiel and abnormal patterns of be-
havior by civilian vessels, especially roll-on/roll-off ships but also
deck cargo ships and others.” 445 There are approximately 33 mil-
itary and civilian airports likely to be used by the PLA as points
of embarkation for a campaign against Taiwan, which foreign ob-
servers  could  monitor  for  atypical  activity.446  Mr.  Thorne  notes
that  the  PLA  would  attempt  to  conceal  its  mobilization  through
measures such as covering military equipment being loaded onto
civilian  ships  with  tarps,  but  such  measures  could  be  detected
through satellite imagery and potentially exposed by Chinese so-
cial  media  users  documenting  military  mobilization  activities  in
their  localities.447  Citing  other  analysts’  estimates  that  the  CCP
is  likely  to  order  a  general  mobilization  “at  least  three  or  four
months”  before  an  invasion  of Taiwan,  Mr. Thorne  suggests  that
changes  in  the  civilian  transportation  sector  would  be  noticeable
just  a  few  months  before  the  onset  of  a  large-scale  military  op-
eration,  providing  a  shorter  amount  of  warning  time  than  other
indicators.448

Enhancing First Responder Capabilities amid Disasters

China’s  armed  forces—namely  the  PLA  and  the  People’s  Armed
Police (PAP)—are the first responders to major disasters and emer-
gencies  in  China  and  are  a  key  part  of  China’s  emergency  man-
agement system.449 By responding to internal emergencies, China’s
armed  forces  are  able  to  practice  skills  applicable  to  military  op-
erations  in  wartimes,  such  as  rapid  mobilization,  logistics,  airlift,
transportation,  and  emergency  engineering.450  The  PLA  and  PAP’s
responses  to  the  COVID-19  pandemic  and  recent  flooding  afforded

510

the forces with some relevant operational practice but also exposed
gaps in communication with civilian counterparts that could under-

COVID-19 Response Strengthens PLA Logistics Capability

The  COVID-19  pandemic  offered  a  real-world  test  of  the  PLA’s
logistics  and  mobilization  capabilities,  yielding  insights  the  force
will  likely  keep  in  mind  if  it  is  ordered  to  engage  in  a  conflict. The
PLA  undertook  large-scale  deployments  of  military  personnel  and
launched  the  first  significant  mobilization  of  the  PLA  Joint  Logis-
tics  Support  Force  (JLSF)  in  order  to  combat  the  pandemic.452 The
JLSF  played  a  significant  role  in  the  initial  response  to  the  pan-
demic,  coordinating  transportation  and  sustainment  to  over  4,000
PLA  medical  personnel  over  a  six-week  period.453  The  PLA  made
extensive use of information technology to track and rapidly deliver
supplies  throughout  the  country,  demonstrating  the “informatizing”
of  its  logistics  system.454 The  PLA  was  able  to  directly  test  its  air-
lift capabilities during the early response to the pandemic, debuting
its  Y-20  large  transport  aircraft  as  part  of  an  airlift  that  brought
nearly  1,000  personnel  and  47  tons  of  cargo  from  cities  across  the
country.455 The pandemic also allowed the PLA opportunities to test
new  command  and  control  relationships  between  the  JLSF,  theater
commands,  and  the  CMC;  to  balance  frontline  and  rear  echelon  re-
quirements; to identify and mobilize finite resources; to maintain re-
liable communications; and to transport personnel and sustain them
at their destination.456

At  the  same,  the  PLA’s  response  to  the  COVID-19  pandemic  also
highlighted  some  weaknesses  in  civil-military  communication  and
did  not  feature  conditions  that  would  rival  the  difficulty  of  a  war-
time  environment.  Lack  of  communication  between  local  officials
and  the  central  government,  as  well  as  the  Party’s  initial  delay  in
making  information  about  the  pandemic  public,  slowed  the  PLA’s
initial  deployment  to  Wuhan.457  In  addition,  while  the  pandemic
provided  an  opportunity  to  practice  logistics,  the  PLA  did  not  have
to  manage  the  transportation  of  weapons  and  ammunition  or  ac-
count for doing so under fire, which would necessitate defensive and
concealment measures.458

Flood Response by PLA and PAP Hones Rescue Capabilities

Throughout  2024,  PLA,  PAP,  and  militia  troops  have  been  mo-
bilized  to  respond  to  major  flooding  events  in  China,  offering  the
opportunity  to  practice  rapid  deployment,  logistics,  and  rescue  op-
erations.* 459  The  practical  utility  of  flood  response  has  even  been
recognized by China’s top leadership; following emergency response
deployments  of  over  a  million  PLA,  PAP,  and  militia  troops  across
17 provinces in 2020, Xi reportedly told the military that the “flood
battle  is  a  practical  test  of  the  leadership  and  command  system  of
our  army,  and  the  army’s  combat  readiness  and  ability  to  perform

* While China has experienced severe floods throughout its history, record-breaking floods and
severe  typhoons  have  become  a  yearly  occurrence,  requiring  evacuations  of  hundreds  of  thou-
sands and sometimes upward of a million people and causing billions of dollars’ worth of damage
and  numerous  deaths.  Al  Jazeera, “China’s  Heaviest  Rains  in  140 Years  Kill At  Least  20,  Leave

Bank, “Natural Disaster Challenges in China: Key Trends and Insights,” August 2020.

the  tasks.” 460  During  heavy  flooding  in  Guangdong  during  April
2024,  for  example,  the  JLSF  deployed  to  set  up  relief  stations,  the
Rocket Force engaged in landslide recovery, and PAP troops cleared
roads  and  delivered  supplies.461  Like  the  COVID-19  response,  flood
response has sometimes illustrated difficulties in civil-military coor-
dination that could undermine the efficacy of future mobilization ef-
forts. In 2023, flooding in Hebei demonstrated the political nature of
emergency response; some analysts believe that CCP General Office
Director  Cai  Qi  was  empowered  to  make  decisions  regarding  flood
response rather than the local Party secretaries, including the deci-
sion  to  cut  embankments  to  protect  Beijing  and  the  Xiong’an  New
Area,  and  that  this  decision  led  to  deaths  of  civilians  and  military
responders in Hebei.462

Enhancing Civil Defense Capabilities

China’s  leadership  is  building  upon  previously  existing  programs
designed  to  impress  the  importance  of  national  defense  upon  Chi-
na’s  citizenry.  It  has  done  so  by  expanding  national  defense  educa-
tion in schools and building out civil air defense shelters.

China Enhances National Defense Education for the Youth

Chinese  leaders  see  national  defense  education  as  an  important
method  for  improving  the  Chinese  public’s  appreciation  of  the  mil-
itary  and  positioning  it  to  contribute  to  the  Party-state’s  military
and  political  goals.463  The  2001  National  Defense  Education  Law
requires  defense  education  to  be  provided  across  society,  enabling
citizens  to  “enhance  their  awareness  of  the  importance  of  national
defense,  master  the  basic  knowledge  of  national  defense,  learn  the
necessary military skills, develop patriotic enthusiasm and conscien-
tiously  perform  their  obligations  to  defend  the  country.” 464  Defense
education activities typically include lectures and visits to bases, as
well as programs targeting students from the primary school to uni-
versity  levels,  aimed  at  improving  public  perceptions  of  the  armed
forces  and  encouraging  recruitment.465  Some  universities  are  now
providing much more intensive training than the traditional march-
ing  and  drills,  including  involving  students  in  simulated  battlefield
situations  and  using  weapons  systems  such  as  drones  and  rocket
launchers.466

China  has  taken  a  number  of  steps  to  enhance  national  defense
education in the past five years. In 2023, the Ministry of Education
and  the  Political Work  Department  of  the  CMC  issued  a  notice  de-
claring  that  some  primary  and  secondary  schools  would  be  recog-
nized  as “national  defense  education  demonstration  schools,”  creat-
ing a way to recognize institutions that excelled in national defense
education.* 467  In  2022,  the  central  leadership  issued  an  opinion
framing  national  defense  education  as  a  means  of  grappling  with
increased  risks  China  faces  in  the  world  and  proposing  a  number
of  enhancements,  including  the  recommendations  that  university
students  and  high  school  students  be  required  to  undertake  three

* The  first  batch  of  2,687  schools  was  announced  in  February  2023,  and  in  January  2024,  an
additional  2,431  new  primary  and  secondary  schools  were  identified  as “national  defense  educa-
tion  demonstration  schools.”  Xinhua, “An Additional  2,431  New  Primary  and  Secondary  Nation-
al  Defense  Education  Demonstration  Schools”  (中小学国防教育示范学校新增2431所),  January  16,

weeks and two weeks of military training, respectively, with certain
middle schools encouraged to provide one week of training.468 A re-
vised National Defense Education Law was passed by the National
People’s  Congress  in  September,  2024,  strengthening  national  de-
fense  education  requirements  for  students  at  each  level  of  the  ed-
ucational  system  from  primary  through  university.469  For  example,
revisions require primary schools to provide lessons to create a basic
level of “national defense awareness” in students and require junior
high school students to “master preliminary national defense knowl-
edge  and  skills.”470 The  revisions  also  improve  the  level  of  military
training for university and high school students.471

China Expands Civil Air Defense Shelters in Coastal Cities

Although  China’s  civil  air  defense  policy  spans  decades,  Xi  has
made  it  a  national  goal  to  improve  existing  facilities  and  build
out  new  ones.*  In  a  meeting  held  during  the  Seventh  National
Civil  Air  Defense  Conference  in  2016,  Xi  signaled  to  provincial
and  local  leaders  that  the  civil  air  defense  system  still  needed
advancement,  urging  the  country  to  improve  its  ability  to  fight
against  air  raids  and  carry  out  “functions  and  missions  of  war-
time  air  defense.” 472  China’s  national  emergency  management
plan  for  the  14th  Five-Year  Plan  period  states  that  it  intends  to
update  the  standards  for  shelter  construction  and  improve  the
planning  and  layout  of  emergency  shelters  as  national  goals  for
2020–2025.473  In  recent  years,  large-scale  efforts  to  restore  and
construct  new  civil  air  defense  infrastructure  have  picked  up,
while localities have launched education campaigns that attempt
to increase citizens’ awareness about how to use civil air defense
facilities.474  According  to  the  written  testimony  of  Lauri  Palte-
maa,  a  professor  at  the  University  of Turku,  the  China  Civil Air
Defense  Office  is  responsible  for  the  maintenance  and  construc-
tion  of  shelters.475

Cities  located  in  provinces  close  to Taiwan  have  been  the  key  lo-
cations of recent efforts to renovate, enhance, and expand local civil
air  defense  facilities.476  According  to  Mr.  Thorne,  Fujian  provincial
authorities, as well as authorities in cities such as Fuzhou, Xiamen,
and Quanzhou, have inspected, maintained, upgraded, and approved
the  building  of  new  civil  air  defense  facilities.477  Examples  include
the following:

 • In March 2024, the Xiamen National Defense Mobilization Office
inspected  over  30 “early-stage  civil  air  defense  projects,”  which
were  originally  built  in  the  1960s  and  1970s.478  The  projects
were  inspected  for  their  safety,  potential  for  development,  and
other  factors,  indicating  they  are  being  checked  for  continued
use in civil air defense and for commercial purposes.479

* China’s  civil  air  defense  policy  dates  back  to  the  founding  of  the  People’s  Republic  of  China,
and the government later increased air raid shelter construction significantly in the 1960s before
allowing  them  to  fall  into  disrepair  due  to  constraints  on  local  budgets. After  the Taiwan  Strait
missile  crisis,  the  Party-state  codified  its  civil  air  defense  policies  into  law  in  the  1997  Civil
Air  Defense  Law,  mandating  that  all  civilian  buildings  could  serve  as  air  raid  shelters  if  they
fit  appropriate  size  specifications.  Katsuya  Yamamoto,  “The  Revitalization  of  Renmin  Fangkong
(Civil Air Defense), China’s Civil Protection: A Barometer of Xi Jinping’s Resolve in Preparation
for Armed  Conflict  with  the  United  States,”  Sasakawa  Peace  Foundation,  July  3,  2023;  Civil Air
Defense Law of the People’s Republic of China (China), 1997.

513

 • In March 2023, a Quanzhou district issued a list of 18 construc-
tion projects with potential civil air defense components, includ-
ing  middle  schools,  health  service  areas,  residential  communi-
ties, industry parks, and other facilities.480

 • In  December  2022,  Xiamen  took  measures  to  improve  its  civ-
il  air  defense,  including  a  new  “Civil  Air  Defense  Navigation”
platform that could aid citizens’ discovery of evacuation routes,
upgrades to emergency broadcast systems, renovations for “ear-
ly-stage  civil  air  defense  projects,”  and  related  educational  pro-
grams.481

The  renewal  and  modernization  of  China’s  civil  air  defense  pos-
ture in proximity to Taiwan, combined with increased public educa-
tion, may indicate that the Party anticipates a need for them in the
near  future.482  However,  Mr.  Thorne  argues  that  civil  air  defense
projects  likely  represent  ongoing,  long-term  efforts  to  strengthen
civil  air  defense  infrastructure  and  improve  national  defense  mo-
bilization  readiness  broadly,  rather  than  an  urgent  effort  to  brace
for  near-term  conflict.483  Chinese  law  mandates  that  civilian-use
construction  projects  in  urban  areas  include  underground  facilities
that can be used as air raid shelters, making it difficult to tell if the
shelters  are  a  signpost  of  an  imminent  theat.484  Nonetheless,  Mr.
Thorne also notes that since Chinese authorities are still focused on
improving civil air defense readiness, “this aligns with the national
leadership’s very likely assessment that the possibility of an armed
conflict in coming years is increasing.” 485

Implications for the United States

China’s  political,  military,  and  economic  activities  covered  in  this
chapter  are  likely  intended  to  serve  multiple  purposes.  In  addition
to  preparing  for  war,  many  of  these  actions  evidently  reflect  Chi-
nese  leaders’  concerns  about  regime  stability,  offering  them  tools  of
political  control  to  tamp  down  dissent,  better  manage  the  economy,
and  respond  more  effectively  to  external  shocks.  For  example,  Chi-
na’s  defense  mobilization  system  can  be  used  to  respond  to  natural
disasters  or  to  call  up  troops.  Aside  from  enhancing  readiness  for
armed  conflict,  activities  discussed  in  this  chapter  can  also  help  to
prepare China for a long-term strategic competition with the United
States  and  allies  and  to  insulate  itself  from  “de-globalization”  and
“de-risking” efforts and shocks to the global economy.

Some  have  argued  that  the  actions  identified  in  this  chapter  in-
dicate  China’s  leadership  has  concluded  that  a  conflict  is  inevita-
ble  and  is  preparing  for  a  war  or  major  hostilities  against  Taiwan
or  the  United  States  to  commence  in  the  near  future.486  Many  of
the  activities  described  above  could  accelerate  China’s  ability  to
mobilize  its  military,  civilian  resources,  and  the  public  should  its
leaders  choose  hostile  action.  U.S.  military  and  intelligence  officials
have  stated  that  Xi  has  instructed  the  PLA  to  be  capable  of  taking
Taiwan  by  2027,  although  they  have  also  said  there  is  no  evidence
China’s  leadership  has  made  a  decision  to  attack Taiwan.487  Other
observers argue that this target date is intended to give energy and
focus to reforms and modernization efforts rather than on setting a
timeline  for  war.488  Nevertheless,  Xi  has  made  clear  that  a  central

514

aspect  of  his  policy  of  “national  rejuvenation”  is  China’s  complete
“reunification”  with  Taiwan.489  The  PLA’s  practice  of  strategic  de-
ception and its increased activity around Taiwan further complicate
attempts  to  discern  whether  or  not  China  is  actively  preparing  for
an imminent war.

If  the  political,  economic,  and  military  activities  covered  in  this
chapter  were  part  of  an  imminent  march  to  war,  some  experts  ar-
gue  that  one  would  expect  to  see  additional,  unambiguous  indica-
tors and activities. For example, Chinese military training patterns
would shift, with a noticeable uptick in defense mobilization training
efforts  such  as  amphibious  exercises  involving  civilian  shipping.490
China’s emergency management system may launch education cam-
paigns and hold trainings on how to evacuate, take shelter, and ad-
minister  first  aid,  particularly  in  Chinese  provinces  closest  to  the
anticipated  conflict  area.491  There  would  probably  be  a  significant
upward departure from the trailing three-year and five-year average
aboveground  crude  oil  storage  utilization  rates.  Aboveground  tank
storage  capacity  utilization  beyond  65  percent  should  therefore  be
treated as a “yellow flag” justifying deeper scrutiny.492 China might
shift some of its currency reserves into alternative currencies or as-
sets  such  as  gold  as  well  as  the  currency  of  key  trading  partners
such as Brazil, South Africa, Turkey, Malaysia, and Indonesia.493

Various explanations for China’s activities are not mutually exclu-
sive,  and  many  of  the  activities  being  undertaken  are  “dual-use”—
capable of serving multiple policy goals, some consistent with prepa-
rations  for  conflict  and  others  likely  less  directly  aggressive.  Any
judgment  about  the  significance  of  the  activities  described  in  this
chapter  should  be  tempered  by  the  fact  that  motives  are  not  al-
ways—or  even  often—singular,  particularly  as  here  when  the  ob-
served  activities  are  so  varied  that  numerous  disparate  policy  ra-
tionales are likely involved. Policies often can and do have multiple
motivations  and  advance  multiple  goals.  Oversimplification,  and
premature  conclusions  about  intentions,  however  appealing  or  ap-
parently compelling, can lead to flawed policy responses.

Ultimately,  U.S.  policymakers  have  powerful  reasons  to  be  con-
cerned about China’s actions and intent. China’s aggressive control,
resilience,  and  mobilization  activities  have  made  it  more  prepared
to  engage  in  a  conflict  over Taiwan  or  elsewhere  in Asia  and  more
capable of conducting hostilities today than it was even a few years
ago.  Furthermore,  many  of  China’s  recent  policies,  combined  with
tightened controls on access to information, could reduce the visibili-
ty of actions that might be signals of preparations for imminent war.
Finally, these activities have reduced the deterrent effect of various
nonmilitary  policies  and  external  constraints  on  China.  Thanks  to
their recent actions, China’s leaders are now likely less constrained
by domestic political concerns, food security concerns, energy short-
age  challenges,  or  threats  of  U.S.  financial  sanctions.  Accordingly,
greater  emphasis  may  need  to  be  placed  on  the  deterrent  effect  of
credible preparations for coordinated military and international po-
litical action.

CHAPTER 8: CHINA’S EVOLVING COUNTER-
INTERVENTION CAPABILITIES AND THE ROLE
OF INDO-PACIFIC ALLIES

Abstract

Over the past two decades, China has invested heavily in capabil-
ities  to  counter  military  action  by  the  United  States  and  its  allies
in the event of a conflict in the Indo-Pacific. As a result, U.S. forces
and  bases  in  the  region  would  face  a  significant  threat  from  the
People’s Liberation Army (PLA) in any regional contingency involv-
ing  treaty  allies  and/or  security  partners,  and  the  outcome  of  any
such  conflict  is  far  from  certain.  In  addition,  U.S.  allies  Japan,  the
Philippines,  and  Australia  perceive  China’s  military  buildup  and
aggressive  actions  as  a  growing  threat  to  their  national  security
and are deepening defense collaboration with the United States. As
the  United  States  continues  to  enhance  its  capacity  to  respond  to
Chinese aggression, it must navigate both potential differences with
allies  about  the  parameters  of  cooperation  during  a  conflict  as  well
as  questions  about  how  to  best  adapt  its  force  posture,  capabilities,
and defense industrial base.

Key Findings

 • The PLA plans to counter military action by the United States
and  potentially  U.S.  allies  in  the  event  of  a  regional  conflict.
Since  at  least  the  early  2000s,  China’s  leadership  has  viewed
the  U.S.  military’s  presence  and  alliance  activities  in  the  In-
do-Pacific  as  threatening,  and  it  continues  to  express  concern
about  new  developments  that  combine  deepening  allied  coop-
eration with an expanded U.S. military footprint in the region.
 • China’s  assertion  that  it  will  militarily  defend  its  disputed  ter-
ritorial  and  maritime  claims  threatens  U.S.  allies  and  security
partners in the Indo-Pacific. Should China’s leadership decide to
use force to enforce its claims in the South or East China Seas
or with regard to Taiwan, this aggression could trigger U.S. de-
fense commitments.

 • The PLA continues to improve the quality and quantity of mil-
itary  capabilities  needed  to  counter  U.S.  military  action  in  the
event  of  a  conflict,  including  a  large  arsenal  of  ballistic  and
cruise missiles, air defense systems, advanced fighter jets, mar-
itime forces, and electronic warfare (EW) capabilities.

 • The PLA has also developed a redundant and resilient architecture
for  Command,  Control,  Communications,  Computers,  Intelligence,
Surveillance,  and  Reconnaissance  (C4ISR)  to  protect  its  own  sys-
tems from attack, and it increasingly has the capability to disrupt
or  paralyze  an  adversary’s  C4ISR  system.  China’s  advancements

(540)

541

in counter-C4ISR capabilities such as directed energy weapons and
anti-satellite technologies may threaten the United States’ ability
to  access  its  own  C4ISR  networks  for  reconnaissance,  targeting,
and other functions in peacetime or wartime.

 • Despite  improvements  to  a  broad  suite  of  capabilities,  the  PLA
still  faces  challenges  in  logistics  and  sustainment.  The  PLA’s
maintenance  system  may  struggle  to  quickly  repair  and  resup-
ply  its  advanced  platforms  and  weapons  systems  under  harsh
battlefield conditions, impacting the PLA’s ability to project and
sustain combat power.

 • Chinese  military  experts  perceive  that  U.S.  and  allied  militar-
ies  are  adapting  to  the  PLA’s  improved  capabilities  and  force
posture.  They  observe  that  the  United  States  and  its  allies
are  strengthening  their  missile  defense  capabilities  while  also
working  to  improve  their  ability  to  strike  China’s  forces.  They
also note that new operational concepts emphasizing geograph-
ic  dispersion  and  joint  integration  across  warfighting  domains
could also contribute to U.S. and allied forces’ survivability.
 • U.S.  allies  in  the  Indo-Pacific  are  adjusting  their  defense  pol-
icies  in  response  to  Beijing’s  aggressive  military  posture  and
activities.  Japanese  leaders  are  concerned  about  a  possible  re-
gional  conflict  and  therefore  seek  to  enhance  Japan’s  military
capabilities  and  interoperability  with  the  United  States.  The
current  government  of  the  Philippines  views  cooperation  with
the  United  States  and  other  partners  as  core  elements  of  its
response to China’s military and gray zone threats in the South
China Sea and its own military modernization efforts. Australia
seeks  to  deepen  security  cooperation  with  the  United  States,
its  chief  defense  partner,  while  re-posturing  its  own  military
for  the  possibility  of  great  power  conflict.  Nevertheless,  allies’
interest  in  working  with  the  United  States  to  address  threats
from the PLA does not necessarily imply a commitment to allow
U.S. military access to their bases during a conflict or guarantee
the participation of allied military forces.

Recommendations
The Commission recommends:

 • Congress  direct  the  U.S.  Department  of  Defense  to  produce
within  60  days  a  classified  net  assessment  report  on  current
People’s  Liberation Army  (PLA)  Command,  Control,  Communi-
cations,  Computers  Intelligence,  Surveillance,  and  Reconnais-
sance (C4ISR) capabilities and PLA electronic warfare (EW) ca-
pabilities  (including  electronic  attack  and  electronic  protection
capabilities).  The  report  should  examine  U.S.  counter-C4ISR
and  counter-EW  capabilities,  assess  the  resiliency  of  U.S.  capa-
bilities,  identify  counter-C4ISR  and  counter-EW  gaps,  and  pro-
vide a menu of procurement options to close the gaps. Not later
than  60  days  after  its  completion,  the  U.S.  secretary  of  defense
shall  provide  the  report  to  the  appropriate  congressional  com-
mittees and brief them on its findings.

542

 • Congress  direct  the  Office  of  the  Director  of  National  Intelli-
gence,  in  conjunction  with  the  U.S.  Departments  of  Defense,
Commerce,  and  the  Treasury  and  other  relevant  agencies,  to
conduct  a  comprehensive  review  of  potential  technological
chokepoints  across  the  People’s  Republic  of  China  military  in-
dustrial base and devise plans to apply controls, in conjunction
with allies, to slow China’s military development.

 • Congress  reinvigorate  and  recommit  to  space  as  an  area  of
strategic  competition,  including  by  conducting  a  review  of  the
commercial space industry to determine if there are regulatory
updates  that  would  ensure  that  the  U.S.  commercial  space  in-
dustry is able to innovate as quickly as possible while maintain-
ing safety as a top priority.

Introduction

China  continues  to  develop  capabilities  to  resist  future  military
action  by  the  United  States  in  a  conflict  involving  U.S.  allies  and
partners  in  the  Indo-Pacific,  such  as  a  PLA  invasion  of  Taiwan  or
effort to control waters and disputed features in the South and East
China  Seas.* 1 The  PLA  has  invested  heavily  in  air,  maritime,  mis-
sile,  space,  and  EW  capabilities  to  target  and  degrade  U.S.  forces
and  bases  in  the  Indo-Pacific  region.2 As  a  result,  the  threat  to  the
United States and its allies is growing more acute.

“Anti-Access/Area Denial” and “Counter-Intervention”
This chapter uses a set of related terms to describe PLA capa-
bilities relevant to restricting the access and operations of foreign
military  forces. “Anti-Access/Area  Denial”  (A2/AD)  is  a  U.S.  mili-
tary term referring to an opponent’s military operations that aim
to restrict military forces’ ability to enter into a theater of opera-
tions (anti-access) and to restrict military forces’ freedom of action
within  an  area  of  operations  under  the  opponent’s  direct  control
(area  denial).3  This  chapter  refers  to  military  capabilities  that
could contribute to such operations as “A2/AD capabilities.” These
capabilities  include  ballistic  and  cruise  missiles,  air  defense  sys-
tems,  advanced  bombers,  maritime  forces,  and  EW  capabilities.4
“Counter-intervention”  is  an  English  term  used  to  describe  Chi-
na’s operational approach to employing military capabilities that
would enable it to deter and, if needed, defeat a foreign military’s
attempts  to  become  involved  in  a  conflict  in  areas  adjacent  to
China.5 Counter-intervention does not itself constitute a Chinese
strategy;  rather,  it  is  a  component  of  PLA  operational  practice
with operational and strategic implications for the United States
and  its  allies.6  This  chapter  uses  the  term  “counter-intervention

* China  views  resolving  longstanding  territorial  and  maritime  claims  in  these  areas  as  falling
within  the  scope  of  its  stated  national  defense  objective  to  defend  China’s “sovereignty,  security,
and  development  interests.”  China’s  2019  defense  white  paper  specifies  that  this  includes  safe-
guarding  “national  sovereignty,  unity,  territorial  integrity  and  security”;  deterring  and  resisting
“aggression”;  opposing  and  containing  “Taiwan  independence”;  and  safeguarding  China’s  “mari-
time  rights  and  interests.”  It  also  includes  other  objectives  related  to  political  and  social  stabil-
ity,  Tibet,  sustainable  development,  space,  electromagnetic,  and  cyber.  China  Aerospace  Studies

scenario” to refer to a situation in which the PLA seeks to resist
and  defeat  a  foreign  military’s  involvement  in  a  conflict  in  the
Indo-Pacific, including military action by the United States or its
allies  in  response  to  a  PLA  invasion  of Taiwan.  It  uses  the  term
“counter-intervention  capabilities”  to  refer  to  A2/AD  capabilities
used in a counter-intervention scenario.

This  chapter  evaluates  China’s  counter-intervention  capabilities
as  well  as  U.S.  and  allied  efforts  to  address  the  regional  security
challenges  they  pose.  The  chapter  begins  with  an  assessment  of
China’s  perceptions  of  U.S.  and  allied  military  actions  in  the  In-
do-Pacific  and  its  investment  in  capabilities  that  disrupt  U.S.  and
allied  abilities  to  defend  against,  target,  and  strike  Chinese  assets
in conflict. It then examines the value of U.S. alliances in countering
China’s  counter-intervention  and  surveys  the  approaches  and  per-
spectives  of  three  U.S.  allies  in  the  region:  Japan,  the  Philippines,
and Australia. It concludes by discussing implications for the United
States. The chapter draws on the Commission’s March 2024 hearing
on  “China’s  Evolving  Counter  Intervention  Capabilities  and  Impli-
cations  for  the  United  States  and  Indo-Pacific Allies  and  Partners,”
consultations  with  experts,  open  source  research  and  analysis,  and
the  Commission’s  June  2024  fact-finding  mission  to Taiwan,  Japan,
and U.S. Indo-Pacific Command.

China’s  Approach  to  Countering  U.S.  and  Allied

Military Actions in the Indo-Pacific

China’s  leadership  views  the  U.S.  military’s  presence,  activities,
and alliance commitments in the Indo-Pacific region as hostile, lead-
ing the PLA to focus significant efforts on planning and training for
the  possibility  of  U.S.  military  involvement  in  a  regional  conflict.
This  perceived  need  to  deter  and  contest  U.S.  military  activity  in-
forms  its  operational  planning,  its  intense  observation  of  U.S.  and
allied defense cooperation, and its investment in a suite of capabili-
ties designed to restrict enemy forces’ operations in the Indo-Pacific
region.

China’s Leadership Views U.S. Indo-Pacific Military Activities

and Alliances as Hostile

China’s defense leadership has long viewed the U.S. military pres-
ence  and  alliances  in  the  Indo-Pacific  region  as  a  threat  to  China’s
security  interests.  Every  Chinese  national  defense  white  paper *
since  2000  has  referenced  U.S.  military  presence  and  deployments
as  well  as  U.S.  alliance  activities  in  the  Indo-Pacific  among  the
chief  challenges  in  China’s  security  environment.† 7  In  2000,  the

country’s security objectives and military activities at a high level. Dennis J. Blasko, The Chinese
Army Today: Tradition and Transformation for the 21st Century, Second Edition, Routledge, 2012,
xv–xvi.

† China’s 2000, 2004, 2006, 2008, 2010, 2015, and 2019 white papers mention the United States
by name with regard to these activities. The corresponding statement in the 2002 and 2013 white

544

defense  white  paper  listed  “negative  developments  in  the  security
of  the  Asia-Pacific  region,”  including  “the  United  States . . .  further
strengthening  its  military  presence  and  bilateral  military  alliances
in the region.” 8 Nearly two decades later, China’s 2019 white paper
delivered  a  similar  message,  stating, “The  U.S.  is  strengthening  its
Asia-Pacific  military  alliances  and  reinforcing  military  deployment
and intervention, adding complexity to regional security.” 9 With re-
gard  to  military  presence,  the  series  of  nine  white  papers  over  this
period  demonstrates  an  enduring  concern  about  the  United  States
increasing,  adjusting,  and  reinforcing  its  military  deployments  in
the  region.10  With  regard  to  alliances,  the  white  papers  reiterate
perceived threats from the United States strengthening, consolidat-
ing, and enhancing its regional alliance relationships generally, and
on  several  occasions  they  draw  specific  attention  to  alliance  coor-
dination  between  the  United  States  and  Japan,  South  Korea,  and
later, Australia.11

Influential  experts  within  China’s  strategic  policy  community
voiced similar concerns during the same two-decade period. In 2011,
a  professor  from  China’s  leading  military  academy,  National  De-
fense  University,  published  a  book  entitled “On  Maritime  Strategic
Access,” which argues that China faced strategic maritime encircle-
ment by the United States and its allies in the Pacific.12 The author
claims  that  during  the  Cold  War,  the  United  States  had  “used  the
offensive  system  of  the  large  number  of  military  bases  and  island
chains” in the Pacific to “build a ‘crescent-shaped maritime encircle-
ment’ ” of China and the Soviet Union, “besieging” them and seeking
to  control  their  maritime  strategic  access  to  the  Pacific.13 The  book
then  claimed  that  since  the  end  of  the  Cold War,  the  United  States
has sought to seal off China’s maritime access to the Indian and Pa-
cific Oceans through a ring of military bases along an “island chain
blockade  line,”  pointing  out  deployments  in  Japan,  South  Korea,
Guam,  Hawaii,  and  the  Western  Pacific  in  particular.* 14  In  2011,
a  PLA  expert  writing  for  the  journal  of  an  influential  research  or-
ganization  affiliated  with  China’s  Ministry  of  State  Security  (MSS)
argued  that  the  United  States  was  deliberately  exaggerating  the
threat of China’s A2/AD capabilities to justify investing in advanced
weaponry, shifting military deployments to the Pacific, and increas-
ing its “containment” of China.15 The author argued that the United
States  sought  to  use  its  Pacific  military  presence  to  “interfere  in
issues  concerning  China’s  core  interests,”  namely  China’s  claims  to
Taiwan,  in  the  South  China  Sea,  and  in  the  East  China  Sea.16  An

article in the same journal in 2016 describes the U.S. military’s for-
ward deployment to the region as a key enabler of undesirable U.S.

Characterizations of U.S. “Deterrence” in Chinese Sources

Although  official  and  unofficial  Chinese  sources  occasionally
describe  U.S.  policy  as  “deterrence”  and  acknowledge  that  the
United  States  seeks  to  “deter”  certain  Chinese  military  actions,
they  generally  do  so  while  dismissing  U.S.  actions  as  hostile  or
destabilizing.  Some  scholarly  sources  explore  what  they  describe
as  U.S. “deterrence”  policy  at  length;  for  example,  two  articles  in
China’s  Journal  of  International  Security  Studies  in  2022  detail
what  the  authors  call  a  U.S.  strategy  of  “deterrence  by  denial”
against  China  and  the  associated  trends  in  U.S.  military  devel-
opment.* 18  The  authors  variously  acknowledge  that  the  United
States seeks to prevent China from launching a military attack in
the Western  Pacific  against Taiwan,  U.S.  forces,  or  U.S.  allies,  or
from forcibly resolving disputes in the South China Sea, but they
still dismiss U.S. commitments to regional stability and conclude
that  the  United  States  sought  to “contain”  China  and  pursue  its
security  at  China’s  expense.† 19  Official  statements  from  China’s
Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Ministry of National Defense also
occasionally  mention  U.S. “deterrence” ‡  as  part  of  their  effort  to
delegitimize U.S. actions. Some accuse the United States of using
“deterrence”  as  a  façade  to  conceal  aggressive  intentions,  while
others simply claim that trying to “deter” China is an aggressive
act  in  itself.20  China’s  Ministry  of  Foreign Affairs  also  expresses
the  perspective  that  U.S.  efforts  to  deter  China  through  nucle-
ar  weapons  deployments,  nuclear  sharing,  alliance  commitments
to  allies,  and  activities  in  cyberspace  are  motivated  by  aggres-
sion.§ 21  Finally,  Chinese  officials  have  stated  that  China  cannot

* A  state  practicing “deterrence”  seeks  to  persuade  an  opponent  to  refrain  from  undertaking  a
specific action. Deterrence relies on credible threats that create fear in the mind of the opponent
that if it undertakes the unwanted action it either will be unable to achieve its objective—which
is  known  as  deterrence  by  denial—or  will  suffer  unacceptable  retaliation  for  doing  so—which  is
known  as  deterrence  by  punishment.  For  more  on  deterrence  and  its  application  to  the Taiwan
Strait,  see  U.S.-China  Economic  and  Security  Review  Commission,  Chapter  4, “A  Dangerous  Pe-
riod  for  Cross  Strait  Deterrence:  Chinese  Military  Capabilities  and  Decision-Making  for  a  War
over Taiwan,” in 2021 Annual Report to Congress, November 2021, 390–392.

† This  negative  view  of  U.S.  intentions  also  informs  assessments  by  both  authors  that  U.S.
deterrence  of  China  may  not  succeed.  One  author  describes  a  security  dilemma  in  which  China
will  “strive  to  break  out  of ”  what  he  calls  “military  intimidation”  by  the  United  States  and  its
allies and claims that this will “inevitably” lead to the failure of U.S. deterrence. The other author
draws  on  the  concept  in  deterrence  theory  that  successful  deterrence  requires  coupling  coercive
threats  with “reassurance”  that  the  threat  will  not  be  carried  out  if  the  deterred  party  refrains
from taking the unwanted action. The author argues that, for both the United States and China,
“coercive  threats”  have  begun  to  overwhelm  “reassurances,”  leaving  deterrence  unbalanced  and
potentially  ineffective.  Chen  Xi  and  Ge  Tengfei,  “An  Analysis  of  the  United  States’  Deterrence

China Perceives Challenges to Its Counter-Intervention from

the United States and Its Allies

China’s leadership likely perceives intensified threats from recent
enhancements  to  U.S.  military  capabilities,  concepts,  and  alliance
relationships.  Since  China  began  fielding  A2/AD  capabilities  in
the  early  2000s,  China’s  official  media  as  well  as  PLA-  and  gov-
ernment-affiliated  academic  journals  have  continuously  noted  U.S.
military  efforts  to  counter  the  PLA’s  counter-intervention  through
its own advances and through deepening relations with allies.23 Al-
though it is challenging to assess China’s overall level of confidence
in  its  current  counter-intervention  capabilities  through  disparate
open source reporting, analysis of China’s past observations reveals
several  areas  in  which  continued  U.S.  efforts  could  challenge  PLA
objectives.  According  to  testimony  by  Maryanne  Kivlehan-Wise,  di-
rector  of  the  China  studies  program  at  the  Center  for  Naval Anal-
yses,  China’s  media  and  academic  journals  express  concern  about
both ongoing U.S. efforts to increase the quality and quantity of its
military  capabilities  in  the  region  and  U.S.  actions  to  strengthen
alliances  and  security  partnerships.24  She  assesses  that  the  most
concerning  developments  to  Beijing  are  those  that  couple  an  im-
provement in an alliance relationship with changes to the U.S. mil-
itary footprint in the region.25

China’s  government,  military,  and  academic  sources  point  to  sev-
eral  trends  in  U.S.  military  development  with  the  potential  to  un-
dermine China’s counter-intervention capabilities. Evolution in U.S.
strike and missile defense capabilities coupled with new operational
concepts  have  improved  the  capacity  of  the  U.S.  military  to  strike
China’s forces while making it more difficult for China to strike U.S.
forces in return.26 Many Chinese government and academic sources
have observed increased cooperation between the United States and
its  Indo-Pacific  allies  against  China’s  military  capabilities  and  por-
trayed such cooperation as detrimental to China’s interests.

 • Long-range strike capabilities increase U.S. reach: China’s state
media  and  articles  from  PLA-  and  government-affiliated  aca-
demic journals show enduring concern over U.S. development of
long-range strike capabilities, which can weaken China’s count-
er-intervention by allowing U.S. forces to attack more effectively
from  a  distance.  The  2011  analysis  from  the  journal  affiliated
with  the  MSS  notes  efforts  in  2010  to  transform  the  U.S.  ter-

spokesperson  claimed  the  United  States  was  heightening  tensions  in  the  region  by “resorting  to
military  deterrence”  against  North  Korea,  and  in  another  they  insisted  the  United  States  must
“desist from acts of deterrence” against the country in order to avoid escalation. China’s Ministry
of  Foreign Affairs,  Foreign  Ministry  Spokesperson  Mao  Ning’s  Regular  Press  Conference  on  June

ritory  of  Guam—which  at  the  time  was  outside  of  China’s  con-
firmed ballistic missile range—into a hub for long-range strikes
as a key avenue for responding to China’s A2/AD capabilities.27
In  2012,  China’s  state  media  suggested  that  Guam-based  U.S.
Air  Force  bombers  paired  with  stealth  fighters  may  be  able  to
carry out long-range strikes on China.28 Articles in the journal
of  the  PLA  Naval  University  of  Engineering  in  2020  discuss
the continued value of Guam’s long-range bomber force as well
as  U.S.  long-range  missile  capabilities  which  could  be  used  for
countering China.* 29

 • Missile  defenses  make  striking  U.S.  assets  more  difficult:  Chi-
nese  sources  have  tracked  the  U.S.  military’s  development  and
deployment of missile defense systems as  a key  indicator of  its
capacity  to  counter  China’s  counter-intervention  capabilities.
In  2007,  China’s  state  media  claimed  that  deploying  missile
defense  systems  near  key  military  facilities  in  the  region  was
among the first recommendations U.S. military experts put for-
ward to counter China’s emerging A2/AD capabilities.30 Chinese
academic  journals  have  since  noted  the  priority  successive  U.S.
administrations  placed  on  improving  missile  defense  in  North-
east Asia and the Western Pacific, especially as China’s missile
capabilities have expanded to reach locations such as Guam that
had  previously  been  out  of  range.31  Some  analysts  assess  that
China’s development of hypersonic weapons is motivated by the
increasing  difficulty  of  breaking  through  U.S.  missile  defense
capabilities.32 One journal article from 2022 even warns that if
the United States employs directed-energy  weapons technology
for  missile  interception  in  the  future,  the  resulting  increase  in
cost-effectiveness of missile defense would represent “a qualita-
tive leap in its deterrence by denial capability against China.” 33
 • Indo-Pacific  missile  deployments  increase  U.S.  and  allied  strike
capabilities:  China’s  media,  government  representatives,  and
other  experts  have  reacted  strongly  over  U.S.  and  allied  efforts
to  increase  missile  deployments  in  the  Indo-Pacific  region,  in-
cluding but not limited to the sale of U.S. Tomahawk cruise mis-
siles  to  Japan  in  2023,  ongoing  discussion  of  deploying  inter-
mediate-range  ballistic  missiles  (IRBMs)  to  Japan’s  Southwest
Islands, and U.S. deployment of a Typhon Mid-Range Capability
missile system † in the Philippines in April 2024.34 The vocifer-
ous objection of China’s Ministry of National Defense spokesper-
son  to  the  Philippines  deployment  suggests  China’s  leadership
perceives the system as a serious security risk.‡ 35 According to

* The journal also emphasizes the value of U.S. investments in space-based information systems
as necessary support for long-range missile strikes. Shi Zhangsong, Gong Wenbin, and Wu Zhong-
hong,  “Status  and  Development  of  Long-Range  Precision  Strike  Operations  Technology  Based

† The U.S. Army Typhon Mid-Range Capability missile system launches Tomahawk cruise mis-
siles and standard SM-6 multi-domain missiles and is intended for targets at ranges between 500
kilometers (km) and 2,776 km (310 miles [mi] and 1725 mi). From its location in Northern Luzon,
the  system  could  reportedly  cover  the  entire  Luzon  Strait,  PLA  bases  in  the  South  China  Sea,
and  even  China’s  mainland  coastline. Aaron-Matthew  Lariosa, “U.S. Army  Deploys  New  Missile

an article in the Beijing-based Journal of International Security
Studies in 2022, the introduction of intermediate-range missiles
in the first island chain not only strengthens U.S. deterrence but
also  complicates  China’s  strategic  calculations  and  could  even
undermine  its  advantages  by  forcing  investment  in  expensive
defense  measures  to  protect  targets  within  China.36  China’s
government  representatives  have  warned  the  United  States
that  China  will  take “resolute  countermeasures”  in  response  to
such  deployments  but  have  not  specified  what  those  measures
would be.37 Ms. Kivlehan-Wise notes that Chinese experts view
missile  deployments  in  the  region  both  as  significant  military
capacity  improvements  and  as  indicators  of  stronger  security
partnerships between the United States and its allies.38

 • New  operational  concepts  could  make  U.S.  forces  more  surviv-
able: Chinese observers and military media have taken a strong
interest in new operational concepts developed by U.S. military
services,  such  as  Expeditionary  Advanced  Base  Operations
(EABO)  for  the  U.S.  Marine  Corps,  Agile  Combat  Employment
(ACE)  for  the  U.S.  Air  Force,  Distributed  Maritime  Operations
(DMO) for the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps, and Multi-Domain
Operations  (MDO)  for  the  U.S. Army.39  Ms.  Kivlehan-Wise  tes-
tified  that  common  themes  in  China’s  media  coverage  of  these
U.S. concepts include that they were developed solely to counter
China’s  military,  especially  within  the  first  island  chain,  and
that they could improve U.S. military stealth, strike, and surviv-
ability.40  For  example,  a  2023  article  from  China’s  Ministry  of
National Defense newspaper re-circulated by the People’s Daily
notes  that  these  various  service  concepts  derive  from  an  effort
to increase the U.S. military’s “distributed lethality,” which em-
phasizes  the  use  of  flexible  and  dispersed  attack  formations  to
avoid  destruction  from  enemy  strikes.41  China’s  military  and
state  media  have  also  taken  note  when  U.S.  forces  practice
these  concepts  in  cooperation  with  security  partners  in  the  re-
gion.* 42 In 2022, one military analyst writing in the Ministry of
National Defense newspaper even argued that the U.S. military
has an overall advantage in the development of operational con-
cepts  that  could  provide  it  an  edge  over  the  PLA.43  Neverthe-
less, Ms. Kivlehan-Wise testified that China’s media has also as-
sessed  that  the  PLA’s  long-range  missile  capabilities  still  have
the potential to counter these new operational concepts, making
them  insufficient  for  the  task  of  countering  China’s  counter-in-
tervention  capabilities.44  Some  coverage  has  also  argued  that
limitations  in  U.S.  network  technology,  firepower  effectiveness,

security  structure,”  requiring  China  to  exercise “a  high  degree  of  vigilance.”  China’s  Ministry  of

and real-world practice of the concepts present reasons to doubt
their effectiveness in practice.45

 • Increased  force  and  network  integration  could  support  U.S.  op-
erations: China has also observed evolving efforts at increasing
the  integration  of  U.S.  military  operations.  In  2014,  an  article
in  the  People’s  Daily  expressed  alarm  at  the  then  multi-service
initiative, “Air-Sea Battle,” which aimed to develop cross-domain
approaches  for  countering  China’s  A2/AD  capabilities  through
both inter-service cooperation and greater networked connectiv-
ity.46  In  2016,  Party  media  describing  a  separate  U.S.  military
initiative  to  counter  China’s A2/AD  capabilities—known  as  the
“Third Offset Strategy”—pointed out the importance of building
a  multi-domain “global  surveillance-strike  network”  to  the  suc-
cess  of  the  proposed  U.S.  approach.47  In  2024,  China’s  military
academic  media  has  explored  the  U.S.  Department  of  Defense
(DOD)  strategic  warfighting  concept  of  Joint  All-Domain  Com-
mand and Control (JADC2), noting the potential advantages of
this  effort  to  leverage  network  technology  and  integrate  com-
mand  and  control  across  traditional  and  emerging  combat  do-
mains,  as  well  as  the  associated  technical  and  organizational
challenges it still poses.48

 • Greater  U.S.-allied  cooperation  could  complicate  China’s  mili-
tary environment: China has also paid attention to the military
implications of recent efforts to deepen cooperation between the
United  States  and  individual  allies  and  partners.  For  example,
since  2022,  Chinese  news  media  and  academic  journals  have
described complete, planned, and prospective U.S. and Japanese
military  deployments  and  exercises  around  Japan’s  southwest-
ern  islands  as  measures  that  strengthen  the  allies’  military
position  vis-à-vis  China  because  they  increased  the  range,  con-
centration,  and  resilience  of  U.S.  offensive  capabilities.* 49  Af-
ter  the  expansion  of  the  Enhanced  Defense  Cooperation Agree-
ment  (EDCA)  between  the  United  States  and  the  Philippines
in 2023,† Chinese commentators argued that the United States
intends  to  use  the  new  EDCA  sites  to  improve  its  position  for
contingencies  related  to  Taiwan  or  the  Spratlys  and  that  the
agreement  strengthens  the  United  States’  ability  to  control
the  Bashi  Channel  between  the  Philippines  and Taiwan.50 The
Trilateral  Security  Partnership  between  the  United  States,  the
UK,  and Australia  (AUKUS)  is  also  a  topic  of  great  concern  to
Chinese  observers.51  Ms.  Kivlehan-Wise  assesses  that  AUKUS

* According to testimony from Ms. Kivlehan-Wise, Chinese subject matter experts believe these
changes improve the ability of the United States and Japan to track PLA air and naval vessels,
deny  the  PLA  access  to  the  Pacific  Ocean  through  key  straits,  and  destroy  PLA  platforms  and
infrastructure at sea and on the Chinese Mainland. Maryanne Kivlehan-Wise, written testimony

† EDCA,  originally  signed  in  2014  between  the  United  States  and  the  Philippines,  allows  the
U.S. armed forces a rotational presence at certain military bases in the Philippines. In February

has  sharply  increased  China’s  concern  about  U.S.  Indo-Pacific
alliances  and  security  partnerships  because  of  its  surprise  an-
nouncement,  the  substantial  military  benefits  it  grants  to  the
members, and a perception in Beijing that Australia had chosen
to  side  with  the  United  States  against  China.* 52  (For  more  on
expanding cooperation between the United States and these al-
lies and partners, see “U.S.-Allied Efforts to Address Challenges
from China’s Military” below.)

 • U.S.  undersea  warfare  capabilities:  The  PLA  has  monitored
developments  in  U.S.  submarine  and  other  undersea  capabili-
ties  because  of  the  likelihood  such  capabilities  will  be  used  to
thwart  an  invasion  or  disrupt  a  blockade  of  Taiwan.53  China
has  invested  in  both  submarine  and  anti-submarine  warfare
(ASW) capabilities to erode U.S. longstanding advantages in the
undersea domain.54 While the PLA appears to have made some
progress  in ASW  capabilities,  notably  through  the  introduction
of  many  airborne  and  seaborne  ASW  platforms  as  well  an  ex-
panded  hydrophone  network,  foreign  and  Chinese  experts  still
assess that China “lags behind” the United States in its abilities
to detect and destroy enemy submarines as well as to protect its
own submarines from enemy detection.55 Some Chinese sources
assert that the PLA may be able to narrow this gap by integrat-
ing supercavitation technology into its torpedoes, which enables
a  torpedo  to  wrap  itself  in  an  air  bubble  underwater  to  reduce
drag and increase its speed.† 56 Since 2022, some media sources
have  claimed  that  Chinese  scientists  are  developing  a  hybrid
anti-ship  weapon  that  travels  first  through  the  air  as  a  hyper-
sonic missile before diving and maneuvering below the water as
a  supercavitating  torpedo,  allowing  it  to  potentially  challenge

* China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs has criticized the partnership as “a clear attempt at coun-
tering China” and sought to undermine its legitimacy through public statements. This represents
a shift from prior years, in which Australia was viewed as more reluctant to participate actively
in frameworks that could be perceived as countering China or choosing sides between China and
the United States. Xia Liping, “Xia Liping: The U.S. Indo-Pacific Strategy from the Dual Perspec-

† Chinese  state  and  military  newspapers  have  observed  other  countries’  application  of  super-
cavitation technology on torpedoes since at least 2015, noting the technology’s development by the
Soviet  Union  and  its  adoption  by  Russia,  the  United  States,  Germany,  and  Norway.  More  recent
research on the technology’s application to anti-submarine warfare was conducted by researchers
affiliated with the state-owned defense corporation China North Industries Defense Corporation
in a journal sponsored by a state-owned shipbuilding company. These sources have noted advan-
tages  of  supercavitating  torpedoes  in  speed,  flexible  firing  orientation,  large  kinetic  energy,  and
cost  effectiveness.  Later  sources  list  range  as  an  advantage,  in  contrast  to  earlier  sources  that
claimed  supercavitating  torpedoes  could  not  yet  match  the  range  of  regular  torpedoes.  Earlier
sources  also  noted  difficulties  applying  guidance  technologies  in  light  of  the  munitions’  great
speed  and  warned  that  supercavitating  torpedoes  could  be  easily  detected  by  nature  of  their
bubble  trails.  Qi  Xiaobin  et  al.,  “Application  of  Supercavitation  Technology  in  Anti-Submarine

 • New  developments  in  U.S.  uncrewed  underwater  vehicles
(UUVs) enhance its capabilities to identify, monitor, and track
PLA  submarines:  Both  China  and  the  United  States  are  in-
vesting  in  developing  new  undersea  drones  that  could  play  a
decisive  role  in  future  military  conflicts,  with  uses  that  in-
clude  intelligence,  surveillance,  and  reconnaissance  (ISR).58
In February and March 2024, the U.S. Defense Advanced Re-
search  Projects Agency  (DARPA)  conducted  full-scale  testing
of  the “Manta  Ray”  prototype  UUV,  an  autonomous  and  pay-
load-capable large-scale UUV that mimics the shape and mo-
tion of a manta ray and achieves the energy efficiency needed
for  long-duration  missions.59  China’s  military,  defense  indus-
try,  and  state-run  media  closely  followed  DARPA’s  Manta
Ray project, publishing reports detailing its development and
capabilities.60  China’s  state-run  media  has  highlighted  the
Manta Ray project’s underwater survivability and made note
of its potential capability to use AI, big data, and new naviga-
tion  technologies  to  “identify,  monitor,  and  track  submarines
and  seabed  resources  of  other  countries  in  disputed  waters
and  key  waterways”  globally.61  China  is  also  developing  its
own mantra ray-inspired UUVs. At the China Military Smart
Technology Expo held in Beijing in May 2024, the Boya Gon-
gdao  Robot  Technology  Company  displayed  its  own  domes-
tically  developed  manta  ray  UUV  along  with  other  models
of  biomimetic  autonomous  submersibles.62  One  team  of  re-
searchers  at  China’s  Northwestern  Polytechnical  University
has  already  developed  six  models  of  manta  ray  UUVs  that
could reportedly conduct tasks ranging from monitoring coral
reefs  to  carrying  heavy  payloads  on  long-duration  missions
with  integrated  reconnaissance  and  strike  capabilities.63

Chinese Commentators Observe U.S. Military Capabilities
in the Middle East

Several  commentaries  in  China’s  Party-state  news  media
view  the  defense  by  the  United  States,  Israel,  and  other  part-
ners  against  Iranian  missile  strikes  on  Israel’s  territory  in
April 2024 as a successful test of U.S. missile defense technolo-
gy and alliance coordination. The commentators agree that the
large  number  of  attacking  weapons  successfully  intercepted
showcased  the  power  of  the  multilayered  missile  defense  sys-
tem deployed by the United States and Israel.64 They also note
the important role the U.S. destroyers played in shooting down
medium-range  ballistic  missiles,  the  contributions  of  U.S.  and
UK  forces  in  intercepting  drones,  and  the  likely  importance
of  intelligence  sharing  between  the  United  States,  Israel,  and
other Gulf states before and during the attacks.65 (For more on
China’s position on conflicts in the Middle East, see Chapter 5,
“China  and  the  Middle  East.”)

PLA Anticipates U.S. Intervention

Evidence suggests the PLA plans for military action by the United
States in the event of a conflict in the Indo-Pacific. In 2014, General
Secretary  of  the  Chinese  Communist  Party  Xi  Jinping  directed  the
PLA  to “make  strategy  planning  and  preparations  for  dealing  with
a  powerful  enemy’s  military  intervention,”  using  a  term  frequently
applied  in  PLA  writings  to  refer  to  the  United  States.66  The  2020
edition of the strategic-level PLA textbook Science of Military Strat-
egy *  makes  repeated  reference  to  external  military  intervention,
emphasizing  the  gravity  of  potential  military  intervention  carried
out by powerful enemies, at a large scale, or at a high intensity.† 67
In one section, the text highlights external military intervention as
a  “strategic  risk”  that  could  result  in  the  PLA  facing  two  or  even
many enemies at one time.68 In other sections, it variously describes
military  intervention  as  an  action  the  PLA  must  deter,  as  an  im-
portant  factor  in  the  timing  for  beginning  and  ending  a  war,  and
as  a  critical  variable  influencing  war  control  and  escalation.69  The
2006 operational-level PLA textbook Science of Campaigns ‡ similar-
ly  frames  the “military  intervention  of  a  powerful  enemy”  as  a  key
variable  that  PLA  forces  must  anticipate,  plan  for,  and—if  neces-
sary—adjust to in the course of executing any military campaign.70
In addition to this general description, the text includes “resist[ing]
the  military  intervention  of  a  powerful  enemy”  in  the  list  of  basic
missions  for  a  conventional  missile  assault  campaign,  and  it  pro-
vides  additional  guidance  on  handling  opposition  in  the  context  of
an offensive campaign against island reefs.71

China’s Military Objectives Implicate U.S. Defense
Commitments in the Indo-Pacific
Several of China’s stated military objectives threaten the inter-

maintains  an  interpretation  of  its  “maritime  rights”  that  is  con-
trary  to  well-established  international  law  and  includes  privileg-
es to which it is not entitled, and it has repeatedly demonstrated
a  willingness  to  advance  its  claims  and  interests  in  these  areas
through  aggressive  and  dangerous  behavior.74  A  conflict  in  the
Senkaku Islands or in the South China Sea could trigger defense
commitments under the United States’ treaties with Japan † and
the  Philippines.‡ 75 The  United  States  also  has  a  stated  interest
in peace across the Taiwan Strait and an expectation that issues
will  be  resolved  without  the  use  of  force.76  Since  at  least  the
1990s, Chinese military planners have acknowledged the need to
base military planning for a war against Taiwan on the assump-
tion  of  U.S.  involvement,  and  they  have  worried  that  the  PLA
could  be  defeated  if  it  does  not  rectify  its  various  technological
and manpower-related deficiencies.§ 77

China’s Military Capabilities for “Counter-Intervention”

China  has  developed  military  capabilities  designed  to  undermine
the  U.S.  military’s  ability  to  become  involved  in  a  conflict  between
China  and  its  neighbors.78  China’s  plan  to  counter  U.S.  military
intervention  requires  the  capacity  to  find  U.S.  forces,  thwart  their
operations,  hamper  their  ability  to  rely  on  satellites  and  other  net-
worked systems, and destroy forward-based assets as well as assets
at long distances.79 Among the most important capabilities for these

land of Taiwan, a claim disputed by the government in Taipei. Taiwan, the Philippines, Malaysia,

missions  are  the  PLA’s  C4ISR *  networks,  EW  assets,  and  offensive
missile  forces,  each  of  which  it  has  significantly  improved  over  the
past two decades. At the same time, however, the PLA continues to
contend  with  issues  sustaining  and  maintaining  its  warfighters  in
combat.

Achieving Information Dominance in Conflict Involving
the United States

China views “information dominance” as a key effort to control
the  battlespace  and  gain  operational  advantage  in  warfare.80  In-
formation  dominance  is  defined  by  the  PLA  as  the  ability  to  es-
tablish control of information flows in a particular space and time
by  collecting  and  managing  information  and  employing  informa-
tion more precisely than the adversary.81 Chinese military strate-
gists believe information dominance is a prerequisite to achieving
air  and  maritime  dominance  and  is  critical  to  the  PLA’s  combat
success  in  any  regional  conflict.82  The  PLA  pursues  information
dominance by conducting informationized warfare, which utilizes
information  systems,  data  gathering  and  fusion,  and  command
automation  tools  to  enable  joint  operations  and  gain  superiority
in the information domain in combat.83 Chinese military writings
describe  modern  warfare  as  involving  “systems  confrontation”  or
“systems  destruction  warfare,”  meaning  a  conflict  is  fought  be-
tween  adversarial  operational  systems.† 84   The  PLA  views  “sys-
tems  confrontation”  as  the  means  to  paralyze  the  functions  of
an  adversary’s  combat  and  operational  systems  in  the  air,  sea,
land, space, cyber, and electromagnetic domains using kinetic and
non-kinetic attacks.85 Anticipating such attacks in turn, the PLA
would also prioritize the defense of its own C4ISR systems against
enemy disruptions and preserve its access to battlespace data.86

Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence,

Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR)

The  PLA  is  working  to  build  a  robust  C4ISR  infrastructure  to
quickly find U.S. military forces and achieve battlefield information
dominance in the event of kinetic conflict.87 C4ISR enables militar-
ies to access—and to deny enemies’ access to—battlespace informa-
tion, including locating, tracking, and targeting enemy assets.88 The
PLA  has  studied  the  United  States’  reliance  on  C4ISR  systems  in

* C4ISR  is  an  acronym  that  refers  to  a  collection  of  individual  systems.  Other  variations  of
“C4ISR”  may  include  additional  systems  such  as  adding  “cyber”  or  “targeting”  (C5ISR-T).  In
China’s  Science  of  Military  Strategy  2020,  it  describes  the  battlefield  information  network  as
a  “C4ISRK”  system  (Command,  Control,  Communications,  Computer,  Intelligence,  Surveillance,
Reconnaissance, Kill) and refers to C4ISRK as a system the U.S. military relies on to synchronize
combat commands at all levels. J. Michael Dahm, written testimony for U.S.-China Economic and
Security Review Commission, Hearing on China’s Evolving Counter Intervention Capabilities and
Implications for the United States and Indo-Pacific Allies and Partners, March 21, 2024, 4; China
Aerospace  Studies  Institute,  In  Their  Own  Words:  Science  of  Military  Strategy  2020,  January
2022, 349.

† According to Jeffrey Engstrom,  senior political scientist at the RAND Corporation, the PLA’s
theory  of  victory  in  modern  warfare  is  no  longer  centered  on  the  annihilation  of  enemy  forces.
Instead,  it  is  now  based  on  system  destruction  warfare,  in  which  victory  may  be  achieved  by
the  ability  to “disrupt,  paralyze,  or  destroy  the  operational  capability  of  the  enemy’s  operational
system.”  Jeffrey  Engstrom,  “Systems  Confrontation  and  System  Destruction  Warfare:  How  the

recent wars and observed how the U.S. military uses these systems
to  conduct  reconnaissance,  provide  early  warning,  and  enable  the
real-time  synchronization  of  combat  commands  at  all  levels.89  Rec-
ognizing  that  its  own  C4ISR  was  an  area  of  substantial  weakness,
the  PLA  began  modernizing,  upgrading,  and  expanding  its  commu-
nications  infrastructure  in  the  1990s  to  support  future  command
and control capabilities.90 According to J. Michael Dahm, senior resi-
dent fellow for aerospace and China studies at the Mitchell Institute
for  Aerospace  Studies,  decades  of  investment  have  resulted  in  the
PLA developing a robust, redundant, and resilient C4ISR system.91
Mr.  Dahm  further  suggests  that  China’s  C4ISR  architecture  could
provide  military  advantages  to  the  PLA  by  establishing  localized
information,  air,  and  maritime  dominance  in  key  areas  out  to  the
second  island  chain  and  by  enabling  strikes  on  U.S.  bases  and  de-
ployed  forces  in  the  Indo-Pacific  region.92  The  PLA  is  also  looking
to  leverage  artificial  intelligence  (AI)  capabilities  to  accelerate  its
processing  of  imagery,  signals,  and  other  ISR  data  across  the  land,
air,  sea,  and  space  domains.93  (For  more  on  the  PLA’s  use  of  AI  to
enhance its ISR capabilities, see Chapter 3, “U.S.-China Competition
in Emerging Technologies.”)

China’s  C4ISR  consists  of  a  suite  of  interconnected  systems  to
support  PLA  warfighter  decision-making  and  targeting  capabilities
across varied domains.94 These include:

 • Terrestrial  (ground-based)  C4ISR:  China’s  terrestrial  net-
work  is  the  core  architecture  of  the  PLA’s  broader  C4ISR
system.95  The  PLA’s  National  Defense  Communications  Net-
work, upgraded in the mid-1990s to high-speed fiber-optic ca-
ble,  serves  as  the  PLA’s  primary  communication  network.96
The  network  connects  the  PLA  command  centers  to  units  in
the  field  with  reliable  communications 97  According  to  Mr.
Dahm, compared to the space-based communications capabil-
ities,  the  “hard-wired”  connectivity  of  the  National  Defense
Communications  Network  could  provide  the  PLA  with  more
secure  communications  that  would  be  difficult  for  an  attack-
er  to  disrupt  or  destroy.* 98  China  has  also  constructed  sky-
wave  over-the-horizon  (OTH)  radar  systems  to  increase  the
PLA’s ability to locate targets such as ships and aircraft up to
1,864 miles (3000km) from China’s coastline.† 99 OTH  radars
are reported to have been deployed along China’s coast since
at  least  2010.100  In  addition,  radar  detected  on  Chinese-oc-
cupied  features  in  the  Spratlys—including  Subi  Reef,  Fiery
Cross  Reef,  Cuarteron  Reef,  and  Mischief  Reef—are  probably
over-the-horizon;  they  would  play  a  crucial  role  in  enabling
the  PLA  to  detect  and  track  U.S.  and  allied  forces  between
the  first  and  second  island  chains.101

 • Air  C4ISR:  The  PLA  has  increased  the  number  of  special  mis-
sion aircraft and uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) that have ex-

tended  the  PLA’s  line  of  sight  and  improved  its  airborne  early
warning and control (AEW&C) and signals intelligence (SIGINT)
capabilities.* 102 The PLA Air Force and PLA Navy together are
estimated to operate 52 AEW&C aircraft, including the KJ-200,
KJ-500,  and  Y-8J.103  Mr.  Dahm  points  to  commercial  satellite
imagery  revealing  new  special  mission  aircraft  that  have  ap-
peared at PLA airfields, including the KJ-500 AEW&C aircraft,
KQ-200  anti-submarine  warfare/maritime  patrol  aircraft,  and
Y-9JB signals and electronic intelligence aircraft.104 These spe-
cial  mission  aircraft  provide  C4ISR  support  to  PLA  Air  Force
and PLA Navy operations and have been flying beyond the first
island  chain  and  operating  from  China’s  artificial  features  in
the South China Sea.105 For example, in January 2024, the KJ-
500  early  warning  aircraft  likely  tested  the  performance  of  its
radar and sensors to support J-15 carrier-based fighter jets and
J-11B land-based fighter jets to track targets and support their
long-range  air-to-air  fires  during  a  live-fire  exercise  over  the
South China Sea.106 In March 2022, then U.S. Pacific Air Force
Commander  Kenneth  Wilsbach  reportedly  noted  the  KJ-500’s
important  role  in  supporting  the  PLA’s  fifth-generation  J-20
fighter  and  the  need  for  U.S.  forces  to  interrupt  the  kill  chain
for long-range air-to-air missiles.107

 • Maritime  C4ISR:  The  PLA  has  developed  several  platforms  to
conduct C4ISR in the maritime domain. These platforms include
surface combatant ships that are equipped with radars, sensors,
and sonars, such as the new Type 055 Renhai guided-missile de-
stroyer.108  Mr.  Dahm  notes  that  PLA  Navy  warships  operating
in  areas  beyond  the  first  island  chain  to  the  South  China  Sea,
the  Gulf  of Aden,  and  Southwest Asia  conduct  long-range  mar-
itime ISR that could provide indications and warning of U.S. or
allied  movements.109 The  PLA  Navy  also  has  a  variety  of  plat-
forms  to  track  enemy  submarines,  such  as  the  Z-20  shipborne
ASW helicopter, KQ-200 ASW/maritime patrol aircraft, and sur-
face  combatant  ships  equipped  with  variable-depth  sonars  and
towed array sonar systems.110

 • Space-based  C4ISR:  The  PLA  has  improved  its  space-based
C4ISR  capabilities  by  increasing  its  numbers  of  on-orbit  sat-
ellites  that  provide  remote  sensing,†  signals  and  electronic  in-
telligence,  and  communications  capabilities.111  Between  2020
and  2024,  the  PLA  doubled  its  ISR  satellites  in  geostationary
orbit; between 2018 and 2024, it tripled its ISR satellites in low
Earth  orbit.‡ 112  The  PLA  is  estimated  to  have  92  ISR  satel-
lites and 81 electronic intelligence/SIGINT satellites in orbit.113

* These  special  mission  aircraft  can  also  conduct  electronic  attack  (jamming)  capabilities.  J.

General Stephen Whiting, commander of U.S. Space Command,
stated in written testimony for the U.S. Senate Armed Services
Committee in February 2024 that China’s advances in its space
capabilities  increase  its  ability  to  monitor,  track,  and  target
U.S.  and  allied  forces  both  on  the  ground  and  on  orbit.114  Mr.
Dahm  notes  that  China  is  reportedly  one  of  the  only  countries
with  electro-optic  imaging  satellites  in  geostationary  orbit  that
can provide “persistent imagery coverage across most of the In-
do-Pacific  to  detect  U.S.  and  allied  ships,”  though  these  images
are  likely  to  be  low  in  resolution  due  to  the  satellites’  distance
from  the  Earth  and  atmospheric  conditions.115  Other  Chinese
satellites  launched  into  geostationary  orbit,  such  as  the  Ludi
Tance-4  01  (Land  Exploration-4  01)  synthetic  aperture  radar
(SAR),  can  reportedly  collect  20-meter-resolution  images  in  all
weather  conditions,  allowing  China  to  more  effectively  detect
and track U.S. ships at sea.116

The PLA’s Counter-C4ISR Efforts

The  PLA  could  use  its  advances  in  directed  energy  weapons,
anti-satellite  capabilities,  and  other  counterspace  technologies  to
threaten the United States’ C4ISR networks and use of the space
domain  in  peacetime  or  in  a  counter-intervention  scenario.117
There  is  some  public  evidence  that  the  PLA  views  researching
and  developing  such  counter-C4ISR  capabilities  as  an  important
way to respond to the emergence of commercial satellite providers
and  their  contracting  relationships  with  DOD.*  For  example,  in
May 2022, PLA researchers from the Beijing Institute of Tracking
and Telecommunications—affiliated with the now disbanded PLA
Strategic  Support  Force—called  for  the  development  of  anti-sat-
ellite  capabilities  such  as  microwave  technology  that  can  jam
communications  to  disrupt  the  functions  and  operating  systems
of  satellite  constellations  like  SpaceX’s  Starlink.† 118  Following  a
December  2022  announcement  that  SpaceX  would  be  partnering
with  DOD  to  provide  technology  and  launch  capability—called
Starshield—to  support  national  security  efforts,  PLA  research-
ers  assessed  that  Starshield  satellites  could  make  it  difficult  for
PLA  military  operations  to  elude  U.S.  monitoring.119  According
to  a  Reuters  review  of  almost  100  articles  in  more  than  20  Chi-

* Examples  of  counter-C4ISR  capabilities  include  the  use  of  camouflage,  denial,  attack,  or  de-
ception activities that could negatively impact the United States and allied forces’ ability to sense
and  target  PLA  forces.  For  instance,  actions  may  also  include  electronic  warfare,  cyber  attacks,
and other physical or nonphysical destruction or disruption of adversary networks, ISR platforms,
and  command  nodes.  One  article  published  in  the  PLA  Daily  by  the  Political Work  Department
of  the  PLA’s  Northern Theater  Command  likened  adversary  ships,  naval  platforms,  and  combat
aircraft whose access to C4ISR networks had been disrupted to “headless flies.” J. Michael Dahm,

† The  PLA  has  also  been  paying  close  attention  to  the  effective  use  of  constellation  satellite
networks  in  warfare,  such  as  Starlink,  which  have  been  used  to  secure  the  communications  of
Ukraine’s  military  amid  attacks  by  Russia.  PLA  researchers  have  reportedly  noted  how  Star-
link services could support U.S. military operations and provide ISR capabilities around Taiwan.

The PLA’s Counter-C4ISR Efforts—Continued

nese  defense  journals,  in  one  of  the  articles  PLA  researchers
expressed  urgency  for  China  to  develop  its  own  similar  satellite
network while developing other capabilities to shoot down or dis-
able  Starlink  satellite  systems.120  This  concern  has  accelerated
China’s development of its own constellation satellite network as
well  as  capabilities  to  attack  or  deny  U.S.  space  programs.121  In
a  counter-intervention  scenario,  the  PLA  would  likely  engage  in
“counter-C4ISR” to attack critical nodes of the United States’ own
C4ISR  systems,  such  as  satellites,  in  order  to  thwart  a  potential
U.S. and allied military advance.122

Electronic Warfare

The PLA has developed substantial EW capabilities to detect, tar-
get,  and  disrupt  U.S.,  allied,  and  partner  forces  operating  in  the
Indo-Pacific.123 In the event of a Taiwan contingency, the PLA could
expect the United States to field unmanned submarines, unmanned
surface  ships,  aerial  drones,  next-generation  aircraft  and  ships
equipped  with  advanced  sensors,  radars,  and  precision-guided  mu-
nitions to target China’s invasion force.124 In preparation for such a
contingency,  experts  assess  that  China’s  developed  EW  capabilities
would  present  a  significant  challenge  to  U.S.  forces  by  disrupting
the  data  links  and  communications  U.S.  and  allied  forces  need  to
operate  during  conflict.125  In  October  2023,  a  senior  U.S.  defense
official indicated the PLA anticipates needing to be better prepared
to operate in a complex electromagnetic environment and continues
to  try  to  improve  its  EW  capabilities.126  In  his  testimony  to  the
Commission,  Mr.  Dahm  argued  that  the  PLA  has  invested  in  EW
capabilities  that  exceed  those  of  the  Russian  military  and  even  po-
tentially those of the U.S. military.127

The  PLA’s  EW  capabilities  include  offensive  and  defensive  capa-
bilities that disrupt an enemy’s equipment or protect PLA weapons
systems  from  enemy  attack.128  In  addition,  the  PLA  considers  how
EW can be employed as a deception strategy by concealing real sig-
nals and injecting false information to mislead adversary operators
and decision-makers.129

 • Electronic attack (EA) capabilities: The PLA uses electromagnet-
ic  or  directed  energy  to  disrupt  an  adversary’s  electronic  infor-
mation  systems,  or  it  uses  anti-radiation  missiles,  high-energy
lasers,  and  electromagnetic  pulse  weapons  to  directly  damage
their equipment.130 These EA capabilities mostly correspond to
ground-based  and  road-mobile  electronic  countermeasures  bri-
gades.* 131 The PLA Air Force, PLA Navy, and PLA Rocket Force
each  operate  electronic  countermeasures  brigades  that  provide
both  electronic  support  (e.g.,  intelligence)  and  EA  capabilities

* An  example  of  ground-based  jamming  equipment  was  reported  in  April  2018,  when  China
installed  the  equipment  on  Mischief  Reef  in  the  Spratlys.  Michael  R.  Gordon  and  Jeremy  Page,

munications jamming. The PLA Air Force currently fields three
Y-9G  variants  and  two  Y-9XZ  variants.† 133  The  PLA  Air  Force
also  fields  at  least  12  J-16D  PLA  radar-jamming  EW  aircraft
with sensors that can determine the position of radar-transmit-
ting  devices  used  to  both  jam  and  target  adversary  radars.134
In January 2022, two J-16D aircraft were spotted, reportedly for
the  first  time,  conducting  an  exercise  alongside  11  other  PLA
aircraft  that  entered  Taiwan’s  Air  Defense  Identification  Zone,
demonstrating the PLA’s intent to conduct EW in a Taiwan con-
tingency.135 The PLA has also developed anti-radiation weapons
designed  to  destroy  radar  or  communications  targets,  such  as
the PLA Air Force YJ-91 anti-radiation missile (ARM) or sever-
al new ARMs like the TL-30 (known as the AKF088C) that can
reportedly fly and loiter in search for targeted enemy electronic
signals.136  China  has  sought  to  improve  its  ARMs  by  produc-
ing a seeker on the missile that could cover multiple frequency
bands  and  could  prioritize  targets  that  are  uploaded  to  the  on-
board  computer  from  the  ground  or  by  pilots  while  in  flight.137
The PLA has also developed counterspace EA capabilities, such
as experimental on-orbit jamming systems and road-mobile sat-
ellite  jamming  facilities  and  brigades  that  can  potentially  con-
duct  non-kinetic  attacks  on  U.S.  and  allied  satellites  as  a  first
move in a counter-intervention operation.138

 • Electronic  protection  (EP)  capabilities:  China  anticipates  re-
ciprocal  electronic  jamming  attacks  as  well  as  kinetic  attacks
against its own C4ISR, and it has taken measures to protect its
systems.  The  PLA  conducts  trainings  and  exercises  to  prepare
units, such as radar brigades, for an attack or to protect against
enemy satellites conducting reconnaissance.139 EP activities can
also  involve  strategies  like “frequency  hopping,”  where  a  radar
or  communications  system  jumps  across  a  preset  array  of  fre-
quencies to make it difficult for enemies to detect and jam.‡ 140
The PLA has also built redundancy into its systems, protecting
against  adversarial  actions  by  developing  a  joint  datalink  sys-
tem that covers a broad range of the frequency spectrum.141 Mr.
Dahm  notes  that  these  datalink  systems §  are  likely  resistant
to  adversarial  intercepts  and  jamming.142  In  effect,  the  PLA’s

* The  previous  PLA  Strategic  Support  Force  operated  ground-based  electronic  countermeasure
brigades  that  likely  focused  on  the  air  defense  of  Beijing.  In  April  2024,  China  disbanded  the
Strategic  Support  Force  and  created  three  new  military  forces:  the  Military  Aerospace  Force,
the  Cyberspace  Force,  and  the  Information  Support  Force.  J.  Michael  Dahm,  written  testimony

† It  is  estimated  that  the  PLA  Air  Force  has  four  electronic  warfare  regiments,  which  consist
of about 31 electronic warfare aircrafts including the J-16D Flanker, Y-8CB, Y-8DZ, Y-8G, Y-8XZ,
Y-9G,  and  Y-9XZ.  International  Institute  for  Strategic  Studies,  “Military  Balance  2024,  Chapter

§ The  PLA’s  Joint  Information  Distribution  System  is  similar  to  the  U.S.  Link-16  or  Joint Tac-
tical Information Distribution System data link. The system is developed as a frequency-hopping
datalink  and  described  by  Chinese  sources  as  being  capable  of  connecting  army,  navy,  air  force,
and satellite communication networks and integrating these service-level tactical data links into

broad  range  of  coverage  over  the  frequency  spectrum *  increas-
es  the  challenge  for  an  adversary  to  jam  or  destroy  enough  of
the  PLA’s  electronic  systems  to  significantly  disrupt  its  ability
to  access  battlespace-related  information.143 The  PLA  has  also
looked  to  utilize  emerging  technologies  to  enhance  its  electron-
ic  protection  capabilities  to  counter  U.S.  electronic  attacks.144
For  instance,  as  reported  in  the  South  China  Morning  Post,  a
Chinese  academic  journal  titled  Radar  and  Electronic  Count-
er  Measure  examines  how AI  could  help  the  PLA  Navy’s  radar
counter the U.S. Navy’s EA-18G Growler’s electromagnetic jam-
ming.145

The PLA’s investments in a diversity of EW capabilities has like-
ly  improved  its  ability  to  operate  in  a  complex  electromagnetic  en-
vironment.146  It  continues  to  emphasize  combat  training  in  such
an  environment;  in  January  2024,  a  naval  brigade  of  the  Southern
Theater  Command  simulated  targeting  and  countering  enemy  air-
craft  anti-jamming  methods.147  Mr.  Dahm  notes  it  is  unclear  based
on  open  source  research  how  the  PLA’s  EA  capabilities  may  fare
against  advanced  and  hardened  U.S.  military  systems  equipped
with  electronic  protection  capabilities.148  Comparing  the  United
States’ and China’s EW systems, it is likely that the U.S. Navy EW
aircraft,  the  EA-18G  Growler,  is  qualitatively  better  than  any  jam-
mer, such as the Y-9G, in the PLA inventory.149 That said, Mr. Dahm
assesses  that  the  diversity  found  in  PLA  air-to-air  weapons,  naval
radars, surface-to-air missile radars, and early warning radars poses
significant  challenges  for  the  U.S.  military  to  effectively  disrupt  all
of the PLA systems.150

China’s Offensive Missile Capabilities

China’s  continued  expansion  of  its  missile  force  is  a  critical  com-
ponent  of  its  A2/AD  capabilities  that  could  threaten  U.S.  and  al-
lied  bases,  logistics  and  port  facilities,  and  other  key  infrastructure
in  the  Indo-Pacific.151  Over  time,  China  has  increased  the  number,
range, precision, and types of missiles in its arsenal, particularly for
medium- and long-range missiles.152 In 2015, at the start of China’s
major military modernization reforms, DOD estimated that the PLA
had  fielded  200–300  medium-range  ballistic  missiles  (with  a  range
of  approximately  1,500  kilometers  (km)  (930  miles  [mi])  with  100–
125  launchers;  as  of  2023,  the  PLA  had  reportedly  deployed  1,000
medium-range  ballistic  missiles  and  300  launchers.153  Similarly,  in
2018,  DOD  published  for  the  first  time  its  estimate  that  the  PLA
had  deployed  16–30  intermediate-range  ballistic  missile  (IRBMs),
with  a  range  of  approximately  3,000–4,000  km  (1,900–2,500  mi)
with  16–30  launchers;  as  of  2023,  DOD  assessed  that  the  PLA  had
500 IRBMs and 250 launchers.154 The large quantity of longer-range
IRBMs  also  enables  the  PLA  to  extend  the  distance  and  frequency

a  single  joint  network.  J.  Michel  Dahm,  “Inter-Island  Communications,”  Johns  Hopkins  Applied
Physics Laboratory, July, 2020, 10–11.

* The  PLA’s  coverage  over  the  frequency  spectrum  includes  ground-based  radars  employed  for
ISR  ranging  from  high-frequency  (HF)  skywave  OTH  to  very-high-frequency  (VHF);  ultra-high
frequency  (UHF);  and  L-,  S-,  C-,  and  X-band  radars.  J.  Michael  Dahm,  written  testimony  for

of  its  strikes  out  to  the  Philippine  Sea  and  beyond,  increasing  the
risks  to  U.S.  and  allied  forces  operating  within  the  second  island
chain.155  The  PLA  has  also  improved  the  precision  of  its  missiles,
as  illustrated  in  recent  exercises  targeting  moving  maritime  assets
and  ground-based  assets.* 156  In  addition,  the  PLA  has  diversified
the  types  of  missiles  in  its  arsenal  and  now  has  a  variety  of  bal-
listic  and  cruise  missiles  that  can  strike  land-,  air-,  and  sea-based
targets.† 157 The PLA has also invested in the development of hyper-
sonic  technology  and  is  known  to  have  outfitted  the  medium-range
DF-17  with  a  hypersonic  glide  vehicle.158  The  maneuverability  of
the  hypersonic  glide  vehicle  could  allow  the  missile  to  evade  U.S.
air  and  missile  defenses.159 Thomas  Shugart,  adjunct  senior  fellow
at  the  Center  for  a  New  American  Security,  also  assesses  that  the
PLA’s greater quantity of anti-ship ballistic missiles will enable it to
strike not only high-value targets like large and medium-size ships
(such  as  U.S.  aircraft  carriers)  but  also  smaller  groups  or  warships
(such as logistics ships).160

Competency of China’s missile forces is difficult to determine. Some
Chinese military analysts project confidence that its missile force is
formidable  enough  to  counter  changes  in  the  U.S.  force  posture  in
the region. Ms. Kivlehan-Wise highlights writings by a retired PLA
officer that claim China’s long-range missiles and warfighting capa-
bilities  in  the  air  domain  would  render  any  U.S.  attempts  to  create
an  “outpost  on  the  first  island  chain . . .  impossible.” 161  Even  so,  re-
cent  corruption  charges  and  the  rare  admission  of  shortcomings  in
the  political  oversight ‡  of  training  conducted  by  the  PLA’s  Rocket
Force  units—reported  in  2023—suggests  a  potential  deficiency  in
the  force’s  combat  readiness.162  (For  more  on  corruption  investiga-
tion within the PLA Rocket Force and the Equipment Development
Department,  see  Chapter  2,  “U.S.-China  Security  and  Foreign  Af-
fairs (Year in Review).”)

* For  example,  in  May  2023,  the  PLA  conducted  a  joint  exercise  about  740  km  northwest  of
Guam involving the PLA Rocket Force and the PLA Navy’s Shandong aircraft carrier group that
reportedly illustrated its capacity to target moving surface ships and naval bases beyond the first
island  chain.  In  2020,  the  PLA  also  conducted  a  live-fire  exercise  where  it  launched  DF-21  and
DF-26 ballistic missiles and successfully hit a moving ship in the South China Sea. International

China’s Logistics and Maintenance Sustainment Capabilities

Improve, but Challenges Remain

The  PLA  views  logistics  support  functions  as  a  key  requirement
for winning wars and has sought to transform its decentralized logis-
tics system to a more centralized hub-and-spoke system that better
enables  joint  operations.163  In  order  to  sustain  the  PLA’s  offensive
campaigns  in  a Taiwan  scenario  (such  as  blockades,  joint  firepower
strike,  and  island  landing  operations),  the  PLA  would  require  ex-
tensive logistics support to transport material and oil supplies, con-
duct  infrastructure  protection,  and  enable  the  maintenance  of  war
material  reserves.164  The  PLA  has  spent  more  than  two  decades
adjusting its approach to logistics to respond to contingencies more
quickly and efficiently and with greater capacity.165 These measures
include the following:

 • Under the 2016 military reforms initiated by General Secretary
Xi,  the  PLA  created  the  Joint  Logistics  Support  Force  with  the
intent  to  improve  the  management  of  its  logistics  and  equip-
ment support system across the theater commands.166

 • The  PLA  has  continued  to  conduct  exercises  and  training  fo-
cused  on  improving  its  joint  logistics  capability  across  theater
commands.* 167 These exercises and training appear to focus on
preparing  for  situations  in  which  PLA  logistics  are  targeted  in
a conflict.168 For instance, in August 2023, the Eastern Theater
Command Air  Force  conducted  runway  repair  drills  and  train-
ing to improve its ability to recover following enemy strikes.169
 • The  PLA  has  conducted  airfield  renovations,  expanded  taxi-
ways, developed new shelters for aircraft, and updated fuel and
munitions storage.† 170

 • For  the  PLA  Navy,  the  service  has  been  developing  replenish-
ment platforms such as auxiliary replenishment oilers and has
been practicing the transfer of missile systems while underway
at sea.171 For example, the PLA Navy’s Zhanlan far seas train-
ing  exercise  in  2020  focused  on  combat  support  to  sustain  lim-
ited  offensive  strikes  at  sea  and  featured  the  first  known  case
of  the  PLA  Navy  training  on  transferring  ordnance  while  un-
derway  outside  the  first  island  chain,  including  replenishment
of torpedoes using a helicopter.172

 • The  PLA  is  also  investing  in  new  technologies  such  as  AI,
autonomous  vehicles,  big  data,  cloud  computing,  data  mining
technology,  Internet  of Things,  5G  mobile  communications,  and

* Kevin  McCauley,  an  independent  analyst,  assessed  in  2022  that  extensive  logistics  exercises
and  training  to  ensure  the  PLA’s  successful  execution  of  complex  and  difficult  logistics  support
plans  for  a  large-scale  joint  landing  operation  had  not  appeared  to  have  taken  place  thus  far.

† According  to  Eli  Tirk,  research  analyst  at  the  China  Aerospace  Studies  Institute,  these  up-
dates  of  hardened  storage  facilities  and  the  expansion  of  munition  storage  occurred  at  airfields
within the Eastern Theater Command that could improve the PLA’s combat abilities in a Taiwan
contingency. Mr. Tirk also assesses that in a contingency involving a large-scale PLA air combat
operation conducting a blockade of Taiwan, the airfields within and around 600 miles of Taiwan
in  the  Eastern Theater  Command  and  Southern Theater  Command  would  allow  the  PLA  to  op-
erate over and around Taiwan for longer periods of time while enabling aircraft on longer-range
sorties conducting counter-intervention operations to refuel and rearm. Eli Tirk, “PLA Capability
to Sustain Air Combat Operations,” U.S. Army War College, February 2023, 147.

other automatic identification technologies to enhance precision
logistics that could improve decision-making for PLA command-
ers.173

Despite  efforts  to  improve  its  logistics  capabilities,  however,  the
PLA  continues  to  face  a  range  of  challenges  that  could  limit  its  ef-
fectiveness in combat.

 • The  continuous  reorganization  of  the  PLA’s  logistics  forces  has
led  to  internal  frictions,  complex  coordination  issues,  and  diffi-
cult  command  issues  that  hold  implications  for  response  time
and efficiency of wartime logistics support.174

 • The  PLA  may  lack  sufficient  logistics  capabilities  required  to
successfully  support  a  large-scale  amphibious  landing  on  Tai-
wan,  and  countering  a  foreign  military  response  would  add
additional  strain  on  the  PLA’s  logistics  assets.175  According  to
Kevin  McCauley,  an  independent  analyst,  the  PLA’s  All  Army
Logistics  Academic  Research  Center’s  writings  reflect  concerns
that  a  U.S.  military  response  could  disrupt  the  PLA’s  logistics
operations through missile strikes or information attacks.176
 • The PLA also faces maintenance challenges. In written testimo-
ny  to  the  Commission,  Cristina  Garafola,  policy  researcher  at
the  RAND  Corporation,  argued  that  shortcomings  in  the  PLA’s
maintenance management system * could present key challeng-
es  to  China’s  logistics  performance  during  high-end  combat.177
Ms.  Garafola  similarly  noted  that  the  PLA’s  rapid  force  mod-
ernization  combined  with  its  lack  of  recent  combat  experience
means  its  maintenance  systems  could  struggle  to  conduct  bat-
tlefield  repair  of  high-technology  weapons  and  equipment.† 178
For  example,  she  identified  maintenance  challenges  that  could
result in degraded performance for advanced platforms such as
the  J-20  fighter  jet  and  the  maritime  and  naval  assets  on  fea-
tures in the South China Sea.179 A second element is insufficient
training for the personnel within the PLA’s logistics system who
are tasked with maintaining important weapons platforms and
other  equipment.180  Ms.  Garafola  also  identified  low  morale
and  ad  hoc  practices  across  the  services  as  key  vulnerabilities
that could compromise the PLA’s ability to maintain its growing
suite  of  weapons  systems  under  battlefield  conditions.‡ 181  In
a  high-intensity  conflict,  any  limitations  in  PLA  maintainers’
ability to service increasingly advanced maritime and air assets
could have operational effects on PLA war-fighting performance,

* The PLA’s maintenance management system is a component of the logistics and sustainment
activities  but  separate  from  the  Joint  Logistics  Support  Force  command  structure.  Cristina  Ga-
rafola, written testimony for U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, Hearing on
China’s  Evolving  Counter  Intervention  Capabilities  and  Implications  for  the  United  States  and
Indo-Pacific Allies and Partners, March 21, 2024, 1, 9.

† The  2020  Science  of  Military  Strategy  highlights  that  the  task  of  equipment  maintenance
has  become  more “onerous”  and  cites  the  potential  for  higher  failure  rates  in  new  weapons  and
equipment not tested under combat conditions. China Aerospace Studies Institute, In Their Own
Words: Science of Military Strategy 2020, January 2022, 443.

skilled  maintainers  to  pass  on  their  knowledge  to  the  unit  prior  to  retirement.  Cristina  Gara-

such  as  low  platform  availability  rates,  reduced  sortie  genera-
tion, or degraded platform performance.182

 • The  PLA  may  also  face  shortages  of  supplies  close  to  the  loca-
tion of a potential conflict. PLA experts assess that its war ma-
terial reserves, including the stockpiling of oil, equipment parts,
and munitions, need to be strengthened along its frontline tacti-
cal areas, such as China’s coastline across from Taiwan.183 Com-
pounding  this  potential  shortage  of  supplies  near  the  vicinity
of  the  conflict  are  uncertainties  about  the  PLA’s  capability  to
respond quickly and move large quantities of supplies through-
out  the  country.*  (For  more  on  China’s  stockpiling  efforts,  see
Chapter  7,  “China’s  New  Measures  for  Control,  Mobilization,
and Resilience.”)

U.S.-Allied  Efforts  to  Address  Challenges  from

China’s Military

U.S.  alliances  represent  a  critical  part  of  the  United  States’  ap-
proach to pursuing security and advancing stability in the Indo-Pa-
cific region, including responding to threats from China’s counter-in-
tervention  capabilities.  Christopher  Johnstone,  senior  adviser  and
Japan  Chair  at  the  Center  for  Strategic  and  International  Studies,
argued  in  his  testimony  before  the  Commission  that  U.S.  alliances
in the Indo-Pacific represent a “foundational strength for the United
States” both for the access they provide and for the capabilities they
bring to the table.184 Allies’ provision of basing, rotational, or other
access  enables  a  routine  U.S.  military  presence  and  ensures  that
the United States is able to respond quickly to a crisis.185 Alliances
can  potentially  reinforce  deterrence  by  complicating  Beijing’s  deci-
sion-making,  since  they  increase  the  likelihood  that  a  conflict  will
involve more military actors than the United States.186

There  are  prospects  for  increased  allied  cooperation  in  the  face
of  China’s  counter-intervention  capabilities.  In  addition  to  the  com-
mon  values  and  strategic  interests  underlying  these  alliance  com-
mitments,  the  United  States  and  its  Indo-Pacific  allies  increasingly
share  similar  concerns  about  the  implications  of  China’s  military
capabilities and objectives.187 There nevertheless remain differences
in the specific activities each country might be willing to participate
in or to support, driven by differences in political will and the capa-
bilities of their militaries.

U.S. Defense Industrial Base Challenges

A  robust  and  resilient  U.S.  defense  industrial  base  is  crucial
for  the  sustainment  of  U.S.  strategic  competition  in  peacetime
and  surge  capacity  in  wartime.  The  U.S.  defense  industrial  base
faces  acute  challenges  brought  by  an  evolving  strategic  environ-

* There  have  been  few  recent  events  by  which  to  judge  the  PLA’s  current  capacity  for  rapid
mobilization.  However,  some  observers  pointed  to  this  as  an  area  of  challenge  during  the  2008
Sichuan  earthquake  and  the  PLA’s  response  to  the  outbreak  of  COVID-19  in  2022.  Elsa  Kania

U.S. Defense Industrial Base Challenges—Continued

ment  that  has  placed  strain  on  U.S.  policies  and  investments,  a
limited  workforce,  and  inadequate  domestic  production.188  Some
problems  currently  facing  the  defense  industrial  base  include  a
high  reliance  on  a  small  number  of  contractors  for  critical  de-
fense  capabilities;  supply  chain  difficulties;  challenges  identify-
ing, recruiting, and retaining talent; and complex and protracted
procurement  procedures.189 These  issues  within  the  U.S.  defense
industrial  base  contribute  to  challenges  and  delays  in  supplying
not  only  the  U.S.  military  but  also  U.S.  allies  and  partners.190
One  area  of  particular  concern  is  the  U.S.  capacity  to  keep  up
with  surging  demand  for  munitions  in  a  conflict  scenario.191  For
instance, high consumption rates and dwindling stockpiles would
compound  existing  limitations  on  production  capacity  caused  by
previous low demand signals for munitions.192 In April 2023, the
Wall Street Journal reported that plans to increase production of
key  munitions,  such  as  mortar  shells,  artillery  rounds,  and Tom-
ahawk  missiles,  have  been  marred  by  a  shortage  of  chips,  ma-
chinery, and skilled workers.193 U.S. experts have also found that
the U.S. military is not buying enough munitions, threatening the
ability to meet the requirements of future conflicts and making it
more  difficult  to  sustain  production  lines.194  Mackenzie  Eaglen,
senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, assessed that
the U.S. Navy likely has an inadequate supply of Tomahawk Land
Attack  Missiles,  as  lackluster  procurement  does  not  offset  cur-
rent  expenditure  rates.* 195  In  testimony  before  the  Commission,
witnesses  suggested  that  increased  cooperation  with  allies  such
as  Japan  and  Australia  may  offer  one  pathway  for  ameliorating
capacity shortfalls in shipbuilding and maintenance or munitions
production; however, operationalizing such cooperation would still
require  substantial  investment  in  joint  capabilities.196  In  a  step
to  enhance  cooperation  with  allies  in  addressing  defense  indus-
trial  base  vulnerabilities,  the  United  States  announced  that  it  is
launching  the  Partnership  for  Indo-Pacific  Industrial  Resilience
with 12 of its allies and partners in the Indo-Pacific and Europe,
including  Taiwan,  in  order  to  fast-track  production  of  weapons
systems.197  (For  more  on  U.S.-Taiwan  defense  cooperation,  see

ahawk  purchase  of  55  missiles  accounted  for  68  percent  of  the  precision  munitions  fired  at  the
Houthis  in  one  day,  a  rate  of  expenditure  that  is  unsustainable.  Mackenzie  Eaglen, “Why  Is  the

According to then Commander of U.S. Indo-Pacific Command Admi-
ral  John  C.  Aquilino  in  April  2023,  implementing  the  objectives  of
the  2022  National  Defense  Strategy  requires  the  U.S.  military  to
maintain  a  “persistent,  lethal,  and  integrated”  joint  force  west  of
the  International  Date  Line.199  The  majority  of  U.S.  defense  sites
west  of  the  International  Date  Line  are  located  in  host  countries,
including  some  that  are  operated  by  DOD  (such  as  in  Japan  and
South  Korea),  and  others  that  are  used  by  DOD  but  owned  and
operated by the host country (such as in the Philippines, Australia,
and  Singapore)  (see  Figure  1).200  U.S.  Army,  Navy,  Marine  Corps,
and Air Force installations at these sites support a range of actions
and  capabilities,  including  missile  detection  and  defense,  logistics
support, training, and exercises.201

Japan’s geography and permanent basing of U.S. forces make it an
extremely important ally for a China contingency. Its strategic loca-
tion  on  the  first  island  chain  means  that  one  of  the  PLA’s  shortest

through the permanent basing of U.S. military personnel.* More U.S.
service  members  are  permanently  stationed  in  Japan  than  in  any
other  foreign  country,†  with  this  forward  deployment  serving  the
strategic  goal  of  protecting  regional  security  and  increasing  deter-
rence against China.203 In his testimony before the Commission, Mr.
Johnstone  described  the  alliance  with  Japan  as  “the  foundation  of
[U.S.] power projection in the region” because of the critical U.S. mil-
itary  capabilities  stationed  there.204  The  country  hosts  U.S.  Army,
Navy,  Marine  Corps,  and  Air  Force  installations,  with  installations
on  the  Japanese  island  Okinawa  (in  the  southwest)  providing  close
access to Taiwan and the South China Sea.205 Japan is also the loca-
tion of the forward-deployed Ronald Reagan carrier strike group.206
The  Philippines’  geography  and  rotational  hosting  of  U.S.  forces
grants  potential  access  to  both  the  South  China  Sea  and  the  Tai-
wan Strait. Gregory Poling, senior fellow and director of the South-
east  Asia  program  and  Asia  Maritime  Transparency  Initiative  at
the  Center  for  Strategic  and  International  Studies,  argued  in  2023
that “there is no contingency in the South China Sea that does not
require access to the Philippines.” ‡ 207 Its position in the first island
chain  also  means  that  one  of  the  PLA’s  shortest  passages  into  the
Pacific is through the Luzon Strait, which lies between Taiwan and
the  Philippines.208  U.S.  armed  forces  have  a  rotational  presence  at
nine bases in the Philippines, governed by the Visiting Forces Agree-
ment (VFA) of 1999 § and the EDCA agreement.209 EDCA allows the
United  States  to  fund  infrastructure  upgrades,  preposition  military
equipment, and rotate forces through select Philippine military bas-
es  for  the  benefit  of  both  countries.210  The  2023  EDCA  expansion
included one new site near the Spratlys that could facilitate U.S. as-
sistance to the Philippines in the South China Sea and three facing
north  toward  Taiwan  that  could  facilitate  U.S.  military  operations
in  the  event  of  a  Taiwan  contingency.¶ 211  Edcel  Ibarra,  assistant
professor at the University of the Philippines Diliman, stated in his

‡ Mr.  Poling  also  assesses  that  U.S.  military  access  from  the  Philippines  and  rotational  access
of key U.S. capabilities at EDCA sites could offer one of very few feasible avenues for contending
with China’s military bases in the South China Sea. Gregory Poling, “The Conventional Wisdom

ernment or if mutual defense obligations are triggered, the alliance
provides a strategic location for forward deployment of U.S. military
forces and for military logistics.212

Australia’s geography and rotational hosting of U.S. forces provide
additional benefits for the U.S. military in countering the PLA in the
Indo-Pacific.* Its location provides military access to both the Pacific
and Indian Oceans, close enough to China to  influence the  military
environment in places like the South China Sea but outside the first
and  second  island  chains,  where  China’s  counter-intervention  capa-
bilities are strongest.213 Bec Shrimpton, director of defense strategy
and  national  security  at  the  Australian  Strategic  Policy  Institute,
argued  in  her  testimony  for  the  Commission  that  Australia’s  large
size and distance from China make it less vulnerable as a potential
forward location for U.S. forces than positions in other allied states
or  Guam.214  She  also  assessed  that “in  a  crisis  or  early  stages  of  a
conflict,  Australia  would  be  seen  as  sensible  location  to  disperse/
repair/sustain [U.S.] forward-deployed forces, and as an obvious hub
from which to flow in supplies, reinforcements and long-range strike
assets.” 215 Australian bases host U.S. military forces on a rotational
basis, including navy, air force, and marine corps elements for train-
ing and exercises.216

U.S. Security Partnerships with the Freely Associated
States
The  United  States  has  strong  security  partnerships  with  Pa-
lau,  the  Marshall  Islands,  and  the  Federated  States  of  Microne-
sia  that  confer  benefits  in  terms  of  geography  and  military  ac-
cess.  These  three  Pacific  Island  countries,  collectively  known  as
the Freely Associated States (FAS), maintain a close relationship
with  the  United  States  through  Compacts  of  Free  Association
(COFA) agreements.217 The FAS are located in a strategic region
of  the  Pacific  near  U.S.  territories  of  Guam  and  the  Northern
Mariana  Islands  and  close  to  other  important  security  partners
such  as  Australia  and  Papua  New  Guinea.218  The  agreements
these  states  have  established  with  the  United  States  include
defense-related  provisions  that  grant  the  U.S.  military  unilater-
al  defense  access  to  an  area  of  the  Pacific  Ocean  broader  than
the  continental  United  States.219 The  agreements  also  allow  the
United  States  to  deny  military  access  to  third  countries  such  as
China.220 Experts assess that the access afforded by these agree-
ments forms a critical part of the current U.S. defense posture in
the  Pacific.221 According  to  Kathryn  Paik,  senior  fellow  and Aus-
tralia chair at the Center for Strategic and International Studies
and a previous director for Southeast Asia and the Pacific on the
National  Security  Council,  “Every  contingency  you  can  imagine

in the Pacific—Korea, Taiwan—everything, depends on [those] as-
sumptions  of  defense  access.” 222  These  countries  also  host  some
U.S. Army installations used for missile defense activities.223

Chinese  sources  recognize  the  strategic  value  of  these  security
partnerships  for  the  United  States.  Some  Chinese  state  media
reporting  on  the  renewal  of  the  COFA  agreements  has  empha-
sized  the  strategic  and  military  significance  of  these  agreements
for  the  United  States,  and  China’s  Ministry  of  National  Defense
spokesperson  criticized  the  renewal  as  the  United  States  trying
to turn the region into a “boxing ring.” 224 A 2023 article describes
these Pacific Island states as “marine and aerial channels for the
[United  States]  to  deploy  troops”  in  the  Western  Pacific,  makes
note  of  U.S.  military  deployments  on  their  territories,  highlights
their  potential  service  as  “logistics  replenishment  bases,”  and
speculates that they will function as alternatives to the U.S. base
in  Guam.225  Another  article  claims  the  United  States  seeks  to
“build  these  three  countries  into  its  forward  bases  against  Chi-
na.” 226 These  articles  ignore  the  agency  and  sovereign  choices  of
the FAS in continuing their relationships with the United States,
grossly  mischaracterizing  the  United  States  as  “binding”  them
into its service and using “coercion” to “tie them to its anti-China
chariot.” 227

Japan’s  Perspectives  on  Addressing  Threats  from  China’s

Military

China’s aggressive military actions in the region, coupled with the
rapid  buildup  of  the  PLA’s  offensive  military  capability,  present  a
growing security threat to Japan.228 In Japan’s 2022 National Secu-
rity Strategy, China is described as the “greatest strategic challenge”
to  peace  and  security,  a  departure  from  its  2013  National  Security
Strategy  that  referred  to  China’s  “external  stance  and  military  ac-
tivities”  as  an “issue  of  concern.” 229 Tokyo’s  concern  of  advances  in
missile-related  technologies  in  its  surroundings  has  motivated  re-
cent  efforts  to  upgrade  its  defense  capabilities,  especially  its  coun-
terstrike  capabilities,  and  to  deepen  defense  cooperation  with  the
United  States  and  other  partners.230  Japan  is  likely  to  determine
that supporting U.S. efforts in a conflict is in its interests, although
the degree and type of support are not yet determined.

Japan  Perceives  Imminent  Threats  from  China’s  Military,

Including over Taiwan

Japan’s  policymakers  are  highly  concerned  that  China’s  security
objectives vis-à-vis Taiwan present a threat to their country, accord-
ing  to  official  reports  and  research  conducted  during  the  Commis-
sion’s  June  2024  fact-finding  trip  to  Tokyo.231  Due  to  its  proximity
to  China,  Japan  would  be  at  the  forefront  of  any  military  conflict
within  the  first  island  chain,  particularly  a  war  over  Taiwan.232
Three high-level policy documents from Japan’s Ministry of Defense
in 2021 and 2022 highlight China’s “intensifying” military activities

570

in the sea and air around Taiwan among Tokyo’s chief security con-
cerns in the Indo-Pacific, with one of the 2022 documents describing
stability  around  Taiwan  as  something  “critical  for  Japan’s  securi-
ty  [which]  must  be  closely  monitored  with  a  sense  of  urgency.” 233
Ministry  of  Defense  policy  documents  and  nongovernment  experts
have  also  frequently  referenced  China’s  military  response  to  then
U.S. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan in August
2022—during  which  the  PLA  conducted  live-fire  exercises  and  five
ballistic  missiles  fell  into  Japan’s  exclusive  economic  zone  (EEZ)—
as  a  particularly  salient  indicator  of  this  threat.234  In  his  written
testimony  to  the  Commission,  Tetsuo  Kotani,  professor  at  Meikai
University  and  senior  fellow  at  the  Japan  Institute  of  Internation-
al  Affairs,  argued  that  China’s  bellicose  military  response  to  then
Speaker  Pelosi’s  visit  demonstrated  a  “real  possibility  that  Japan
would be directly involved in a Taiwan contingency.” 235

Tokyo  is  similarly  concerned  about  China’s  aggressive  mili-
tary  presence  elsewhere  in  the  region.  In  2019,  a  Ministry  of  De-
fense-produced white paper, “Defense of Japan,” noted that the PLA
Navy  and  Air  Force  had  “expanded  and  intensified  their  activities
in the surrounding sea areas and airspace of Japan,” seeking to de-
sensitize  its  neighbors  to  increased  PLA  presence  in  the  region.236
Furthermore,  its  2022  National  Defense  Strategy  notes  China  “in-
tensifying its activities across the entire region surrounding Japan,”
including the East China Sea, Sea of Japan, western Pacific Ocean,
South  China  Sea,  and  into  the  second  island  chain.237  The  Min-
istry  also  released  detailed  documentation  highlighting  the  PLA’s
expanding  activities  in  the  maritime  and  air  domains  in  the  Sea
of  Japan,  around  its  main  island,  its  southwestern  islands,  and  the
Japanese-administered  Senkaku  Islands.238  Japan’s  Self-Defense
Force  has  also  frequently  referenced  its  need  to  contend  with  an
increase  in  joint  Chinese  and  Russian  military  activities  operating
near its territory.* 239

Finally,  Japan  perceives  China’s  ongoing  military  modernization
as  a  threat  because  it  enables  China’s  aggressive  military  posture.
Tokyo’s  2022  National  Defense  Strategy  highlighted  advancements
in  China’s  military  modernization  that  have  improved  China’s  A2/
AD military capabilities in the surrounding area, directly threaten-
ing Japan.240 For example, the Strategy pointed out that China now
possesses  larger  numbers  of  modern  naval  and  air  assets  and  has
built  a  large  arsenal  of  intermediate-  and  medium-range  missiles,
anti-ship  ballistic  missiles,  long-range  land-attack  cruise  missiles,
and  hypersonic  glide  vehicles,  all  of  which  could  strike  Japan.† 241

* Japan has witnessed the PLA and Russian Navy conduct joint exercises circumnavigating its
archipelago and operating near its territory. Japan has also scrambled its Air Self-Defense Force
fighters  in  response  to  China  and  Russia’s  joint  bomber  flights  that  have  occurred  seven  times
since  July  2019  over  the  Sea  of  Japan  and  the  East  China  Sea.  Japan’s  Ministry  of  Defense,

ages  dating  back  to  2013  appear  to  show  the  PLA  Rocket  Force  using  ship  targets  similar  in

In 2023, the “Defense of Japan” white paper pointed with particular
concern  to  China’s  growing  number  of  nuclear  warheads,  construc-
tion  of  a  second  indigenous  aircraft  carrier,  and  development  of  a
wide variety of UAVs.242 When referencing expanding PLA capabil-
ities,  the  Ministry  of  Defenses’  policy  documents  clearly  articulate
that  this  military  buildup  provides  the  backing  for  the  aggressive
activities threatening Japan.243 Regarding nuclear weapons specifi-
cally, a salient concern in Tokyo is that China’s rapid and nontrans-
parent  nuclear  modernization  could  undermine  the  U.S.  ability  to
protect Japan under its nuclear umbrella.* 244

Japan Seeks to Defend against China’s Military Threats

Japan  has  updated  its  defense  policy  to  upgrade  its  defense  ca-
pabilities, develop counterstrike capacity, and integrate its capabili-
ties  across  domains.245  In  December  2023, Tokyo  raised  its  defense
budget to a record-high $56 billion  (7.9  trillion yen), with  a plan  to
increase  its  defense  budget  to  2  percent  of  its  gross  domestic  prod-
uct (GDP) by 2027.246 However, the weakening of the Japanese yen
may  undermine  Japan’s  plans  to  invest  in  its  military  buildup.† 247
Mr.  Kotani’s  testimony  to  the  Commission  pointed  to  Russia’s  in-
vasion  of  Ukraine  and  China’s  intensifying  military  activities  as
factors  that  drove  popular  support  for  dramatic  changes  to  Japan’s
defense  policy.248  Tokyo’s  higher  defense  budget  would  enable  the
upgrade of its indigenous standoff missiles as a denial capability; se-
cure  sufficient  munitions  and  fuel;  and  accelerate  the  procurement
of  additional  Type-12  cruise  missiles  and  Tomahawks,‡  as  well  as
the  development  of  hypersonic  guided  missiles.249 According  to  the
2022  National  Security  Strategy,  developing  counterstrike  capabil-
ities  means  that  in  the  event  of  a  missile  attack  by  an  opponent,
Japan would have the capability to mount an effective counterstrike
to prevent further attacks.§ 250

* Specifically, as Mr. Kotani explained in his testimony, Japan fears that if China’s rapid nuclear

boldened to initiate a conventional war against its neighbors without fearing a nuclear war with
the  United  States.  Tetsuo  Kotani,  oral  testimony  for  U.S.-China  Economic  and  Security  Review

† The  weakened  yen  has  eroded  Japan’s  government’s  purchasing  power,  which,  according  to
Satoshi  Morimoto,  a  former  Japanese  defense  minister,  could  result  in  the  value  of  the  defense
budget  being  reduced  by  30  percent  over  the  next  five  years.  In  analysis  published  by  the  New
York  Times,  due  to  the  weak  yen  to  the  dollar,  the  cost  of  equipment  has  increased,  including
for the U.S.-made Tomahawk missile, helicopters, submarines, and tanks. River Akira Davis and

own  and  at  long  range,”  which  would  raise  China’s  risk  calculus  and  bolster  deterrence  against
aggression.  Christopher  B.  Johnstone,  written  testimony  for  U.S.-China  Economic  and  Security

Japan  has  also  made  efforts  to  bolster  its  defense  capabilities  by
expanding its military bases along its southwestern islands, as close
as 68 miles from Taiwan.251 Masafumi Iida, a leading China analyst
at  the  National  Institute  of  Defense  Studies  in  Tokyo,  argues  that
Japan  must  enhance  the  presence  and  capabilities  of  the  Self-De-
fense  Forces  in  the  southwest  islands  to  deal  with  “possible  con-
tingencies  involving Taiwan  and  other  areas.” 252  Japan  has  opened
bases  that  can  accommodate  land-to-ship  and  land-to-air  missile
units on Miyako in 2019 and Ishigaki in 2023, and in March 2024 it
deployed  a  Ground  Self-Defense  Force  unit  based  on Yonaguni  that
conducts EW, including intercepting adversary communications and
jamming  radar.253 The  expanded  bases  on  its  southwestern  islands
could  complicate  Chinese  decision-making  in  the  event  of  a  conflict
over Taiwan,  potentially  offering  U.S.  forces  access  to  operate  from
these  bases.254  In  addition,  Japan  is  reportedly  upgrading  civilian
air  hubs  and  seaports  for  dual-use  capability  across  the  southwest
islands, as well as ports in the north, to address concerns of a short-
age of facilities that could be used in possible contingencies.255

A  key  element  of  Japan’s  evolving  defense  policies  is  deepening
defense  cooperation  with  the  United  States  and  other  like-minded
countries  in  the  Indo-Pacific.  The  United  States  and  Japan  have
agreed  to  expand  U.S.  presence,  improve  interoperability,  cooperate
on  enhancing  missile  defense  capabilities,  explore  opportunities  to
conduct  maintenance  and  repair  of  U.S.  naval  ships  at  commercial
shipyards in Japan,* and deepen defense science and technology co-
operation.256  In  2024,  the  two  countries’  announced  new  efforts  to
increase  coordination  on  military  command  and  control,  which  will
enhance  interoperability  between  the  two  militaries  both  in  peace-
time  and  in  a  crisis.257  On  July  28,  2024,  both  sides  convened  the
Security  Consultative  Committee  (also  known  as  the  2+2)  and  an-
nounced  that  the  United  States  intends  to  reconstitute  U.S.  Forces
Japan  (USFJ)  as  a  joint  force  headquarters  reporting  to  the  com-
mander  of  U.S.  Indo-Pacific  Command  and  serve  as  the  counter-
part  to  the  Japan  Self-Defense  Forces  Joint  Operations  Command
(JJOC).258  In  a  phased  approach,  the  USFJ  will  assume  primary
responsibility  for  coordinating  security  activities  in  and  around  Ja-

* The U.S. Navy seeks to improve ship construction and repair yards and place major shipbuild-
ing programs back on schedule by looking to partners and allies in the Indo-Pacific. U.S. Ambas-
sador to Japan Ralph Emmanuel said that U.S. shipyards are “on average 4,000 days behind on
repair and maintenance.” Currently, in the case of multiyear repairs, the Japan-based U.S. naval
ships are redeployed to a home port to the United States and a replacement vessel is subsequent-
ly forward deployed to Japan. Forward-deployed U.S. naval ships are currently serviced on site at
U.S. naval bases in Yokosuka and Sasebo using contract Japanese workers. As of August 9, 2024,
the Senate and House versions for the fiscal year (FY) 2025 National Defense Authorization Act
(NDAA)  both  included  provisions  related  to  the  overhaul,  repair,  and  maintenance  of  deployed
U.S. naval vessels in shipyards outside of the United States or Guam. The Senate FY 2025 NDAA
includes  a  provision  for  the  secretary  of  the  navy  to  conduct  a  pilot  program  to  perform  main-
tenance and repair on forward-deployed naval force ships in foreign shipyards during scheduled

pan  in  accordance  with  the  U.S.-Japan  Treaty  of  Mutual  Coopera-
tion  and  Security.259  The  United  States  increased  its  presence  in
Japan  by  establishing  the  Marine  Littoral  Regiment  in  Okinawa
in 2022 with ISR and missile capabilities to cooperate with Japan’s
anti-ship  and  air  defense  units  in  Japan’s  southwestern  islands.260
The  two  countries’  have  also  agreed  to  jointly  develop  a  hypersonic
missile  interceptor,  further  enhancing  allied  missile  defense  capa-
bilities.261  In  addition  to  strengthening  bilateral  defense  ties  with
the  United  States,  Japan  has  expanded  cooperation  with Australia,
the  Philippines,  the  UK,  and  the  Republic  of  Korea.* 262  Finally,  it
has increased trilateral cooperation with the United States and the
Philippines † and with the United States and Australia.‡ 263

Japan Likely to Support U.S. Military Action in a Conflict

In  light  of  Japan’s  high  level  of  perceived  threat  from  the  PLA
and  close  defense  cooperation  with  the  United  States,  its  policy-
makers  would  likely  determine  some  level  of  cooperation  with  the
United States to be in the country’s interest in a conflict—including
a conflict over Taiwan. As detailed above, Tokyo’s defense policy doc-
uments clearly show that PLA aggression against Taiwan threatens
Japan’s immediate security.§ 264

Nevertheless,  Japan  is  not  guaranteed  to  grant  the  degree  of  ac-
cess  to  its  military  facilities  that  the  United  States  might  prefer,
and  it  may  decide  not  to  involve  its  own  military  forces  at  all.  Un-
der  the  Japan-U.S.  Security  Treaty,  Article  6  provides  U.S.  forces
the  use  of  “facilities  and  areas  in  Japan”  for  the  “maintenance  of
international peace and security in the Far East,” which some ana-
lysts assess could be interpreted to include a conflict over Taiwan.265
However,  the  United  States’  use  of  facilities  and  areas  in  Japan  as
bases for military combat—other than that conducted in response to
an armed attack—would require “prior consultation” ¶ before access

* Japan  has  signed  reciprocal  access  agreements  with  both Australia  and  the  UK  in  2023.  On
July 8, 2024, Japan and the Philippines signed a reciprocal access agreement with the Philippines
that  would  be  used  to  support  future  bilateral  and  multilateral  military  exercises  and  training,
including  humanitarian  assistance  and  disaster  relief  operations.  Japan’s  Ministry  of  Foreign

§ In  recent  years,  even  Japan’s  joint  statements  with  international  counterparts  have  also
grown  more  vocal  about  the  importance  of  stability  in  the Taiwan  Strait,  suggesting  a  desire  to

under Article 6, any “major changes in the deployment into Japan of United States armed forces,

is  approved,  allowing  opportunity  to  voice  concerns  about  risks.266
In  observing  Tokyo’s  policy  shift  since  2010,  Mr.  Johnstone  testi-
fied  he  is  no  longer  concerned  about “first-order  questions”  such  as
whether  the  U.S.  military  would  be  permitted  to  operate  from  its
military bases in Japan in a conflict scenario.267 Uncertainties nev-
ertheless  remain  about  whether  public  opinion  would  support  fur-
ther  U.S.  military  access  to  all  of  Japan’s  military  bases  or  civilian
ports and airports.268 Mr. Johnstone also cautioned that he remains
uncertain  on  “second-order  question[s]”  such  as  the  degree  of  mili-
tary  support  Tokyo  would  provide.269  Any  use  of  force,  whether  in
self-defense  in  response  to  a  direct  attack  on  Japanese  territory  or
in  collective  self-defense  in  response  to  an  attack  on  a  third  party,
must be approved by the Diet.270 The Japanese Diet was divided on
the 2015 security legislation establishing Japan’s right to collective
self-defense, and a more recent opinion poll from 2022 suggests ap-
proving the use of military force even in noncombat roles could be a
politically unpopular decision.* 271

If  China  were  to  strike  Japanese  territory,  including  U.S.  bases,
experts  assess  this  would  increase  the  likelihood  of Tokyo  granting
the  U.S.  military  permission  to  conduct  combat  operations  from  its
bases.272 Such strikes would also constitute what the Japanese gov-
ernment terms an “armed attack situation,” which provides justifica-
tion for the potential use of military force by Japan.273 At an event
in  2021,  Japan’s  then  Deputy  Prime  Minister Taro Aso  commented
that  “if  a  major  problem  took  place  in  Taiwan,  it  would  not  be  too
much to say that it could relate to a survival-threatening situation,”
invoking  a  term  for  a  situation  that  could  justify  use  of  military
force  in  defense  of  a  third  party,  although  Japan’s  government  did
not confirm the comment reflected official policy.274

The  Philippines’  Perspectives  on  Addressing  Threats  from

China’s Military

The  current  government  of  the  Philippines  views  China’s  aggres-
sive  military  activities  in  the  South  China  Sea  as  a  serious  threat
to  its  military  and  economic  security,  and  it  is  concerned  about  the
impact a conflict between China and the United States would have
on  regional  stability.  The  Philippines  seeks  to  improve  its  own  ca-
pacity  to  defend  its  maritime  interests  against  China’s  aggression
through  military  modernization  and  deepening  security  partner-
ships throughout the region.

The  Philippines  Views  China’s  Military  as  a  Present  and

Potential Future Threat

A chief concern for the current government of the Philippines un-
der  President  Ferdinand  Marcos  Jr.  is  China’s  aggressive  military

major changes in their equipment, and the use of facilities and areas in Japan as bases for mil-
itary  combat  operations  to  be  undertaken  from  Japan  other  than  those  conducted  under Article
V  of  the  said Treaty,  shall  be  the  subjects  of  prior  consultation  with  the  Government  of  Japan.”

and the United States of America, 1960.

* One  public  opinion  poll  from  2022  found  that  only  22.5  percent  of  Japanese  respondents
supported  Japan’s  forces  fighting  with  the  United  States  against  the  PLA  in  a  Taiwan  conflict,
while  74.2  percent  opposed  it.  Further,  only  44.8  percent  supported  Japan’s  forces  performing
noncombat supportive roles, with 51.1 percent opposing such action. Zhuoran Li, “No, Japan Will

presence  and  activities  in  the  South  China  Sea.*  The  2023  Phil-
ippine  National  Security  Policy  notes  that  other  South  China  Sea
claimants’  “methods  of  asserting  their  positions”  pose  a  “strategic
challenge.” 275  As  Mr.  Ibarra  emphasized  in  his  testimony  for  the
Commission, the Philippines faces acute threats from China in this
area.276 One element of this threat is the presence of PLA military
installations on South China Sea features in the Philippines’ imme-
diate vicinity, with the closest located only about 140 miles from its
fifth-largest  island,  Palawan.277  Mr.  Ibarra  assesses  that  these  in-
stallations could “give China [an] early advantage against the Phil-
ippines  in  the  event  of  war.” 278  A  second  element  of  the  threat  is
aggressive “gray zone” activities from China’s military and paramil-
itary  forces  in  the  South  China  Sea,  which  have  included  blocking,
swarming, ramming, and even sinking Philippine vessels as well as
targeting  them  with  water  cannons,  laser  weapons,  and  naval  gun
rangefinders.279  These  aggressive  actions  present  both  a  physical
threat to Philippine forces and assets and a severe challenge to eco-
nomic  security,  preventing  the  country  from  exploring  or  exploiting
many  of  the  natural  resources  within  its  own  EEZ.280  (For  more
on  China’s  aggressive  actions  in  the  South  China  Sea  against  the
Philippines, see Chapter 2, “U.S.-China Security and Foreign Affairs
(Year in Review).”)

In  addition,  the  Philippine  government  and  public  are  concerned
about  the  implications  of  a  military  conflict  involving  China  for  its
own  security  interests  and  the  lives  of  its  citizens.  Its  National  Se-
curity  Policy  voices  concern  over  “heightened  rivalries  among  the
major powers,” noting that the resulting tense geopolitical landscape
means  regional  flashpoints  could  potentially  serve  as  “tinderboxes
for  conflict.” 281  Philippine  policymakers  are  also  concerned  about
conflict  in  the  Taiwan  Strait,  especially  the  severe  impact  on  eco-
nomic  stability,  threat  to  the  welfare  of  Filipinos  in  Taiwan,  and
potential influx of refugees to the country that would result.282 Poll-

* The  degree  of  importance  that  the  Philippines’  previous  president  Roderigo  Duterte  placed
on  asserting  Philippine  rights  vis-à-vis  China  in  the  South  China  Sea  was  not  consistent  over
the course of his time in office. Overall, then President Duterte pursued a relatively conciliatory
approach to China in hopes of benefiting from China’s promises of economic cooperation. His ad-
ministration is described as having downplayed China’s aggressive behavior in the South China
Sea  and  at  first  largely  ignoring  the  decisive  tribunal  ruling  in  2016  that  struck  down  many  of
China’s  maritime  claims  in  favor  of  the  Philippines.  China’s  embassy  and  some  media  sources
have  even  alleged  that  the  Duterte  Administration  brokered  an  informal  deal  or  “gentleman’s
agreement”  with  China  to  avoid  confrontation  over  Second  Thomas  Shoal—a  low-tide  feature
within the Philippines EEZ that China seeks to control. (For more on Second Thomas Shoal and
China’s  recent  aggression  in  this  area,  see  Chapter  2,  “U.S.-China  Security  and  Foreign  Affairs
(Year  in  Review).”)  Descriptions  of  the  alleged  deal  suggest  China  may  have  offered  the  Philip-
pines  limited  fishing  rights  and  potentially  other  economic  benefits  in  exchange  for  agreeing  to
restrict  deliveries  of  supplies  to  the  grounded  Philippine  warship  on  the  shoal.  Other  analysts
and observers note, however, that continued escalation of China’s aggression in the South China
Sea led then President Duterte to harden his stance in 2020 and to begin insisting that the 2016
tribunal ruling be respected. In his final state of the nation speech in July 2021, he changed his
stance and again downplayed the significance of the ruling. Christopher Bodeen, “China Publiciz-

The Philippines Invests in Security Partnerships and Its Own

Capabilities

Although  the  previous  Duterte  government  temporarily  sought
to  downgrade  the  Philippines’  security  cooperation  with  the  United
States  as  part  of  its  conciliatory  policy  toward  China,*  the  current
government  is  deepening  its  security  partnership  with  the  United
States  as  a  key  avenue  for  addressing  the  challenges  from  China’s
military.  The  2023  expansion  of  EDCA,  which  allows  the  U.S.  mil-
itary  a  rotational  presence  at  certain  Philippine  bases,  represents
a  continued  commitment  to  defense  cooperation  with  the  United
States  relating  to  Manila’s  security  interests.284  The  two  countries
also continue efforts to upgrade infrastructure † at EDCA locations,
some  of  which  play  an  important  role  in  facilitating  joint  action  in
the South China Sea.285 The allies also conduct an annual military
exercise, Balikatan, which aims to increase interoperability and has
increased  in  complexity  over  the  past  several  years.‡ 286  Balikatan
2023  was  the  largest  iteration  of  the  exercise  to  date,  with  more
than  17,600  members  of  the  two  countries’  militaries  participating,
almost  double  the  number  from  2022.287  The  exercise  focused  on
improving capabilities in the areas of maritime security, amphibious
operations, live-fire training, aviation operations, and cyber defense,
among  others.288  The  2024  exercise  took  place  in  areas  facing  Tai-
wan and the South China Sea, and it was the first to occur outside
the Philippines’ territorial waters in its EEZ.289 The exercise includ-
ed  activities  on  maritime  security,  sensing,  and  targeting;  air  and
missile  defense;  dynamic  missile  strikes;  cyber  defense;  and  infor-
mation  operations.290  The  United  States  and  the  Philippines  have
conducted joint patrols in the waters near Taiwan in the South Chi-
na  Sea.291  They  have  also  increased  the  cooperation  between  their

* In  February  2020,  then  President  Duterte  announced  the  cancelation  of  the  U.S.-Philippines
Visiting  Forces  Agreement  (VFA),  which  in  1999  established  the  legal  basis  for  the  presence  of
U.S.  Armed  Forces  personnel  visiting  the  Philippines.  After  several  subsequent  announcements
suspending this cancelation and a meeting between then President Duterte and U.S. Secretary of
Defense Lloyd Austin, the agreement was fully restored in July 2021. Andrea Chloe-Wong, “Dute-

and  the  Philippines  are  working  to  facilitate  military  intelligence
sharing,  although  efforts  to  conclude  the  requisite  agreement  re-
main in progress.* 293

The  Philippines  continues  to  pursue  investments  in  its  own  mil-
itary  capabilities,  especially  in  the  maritime  and  air  domains.  In
addition  to  enhanced  cooperation  with  the  United  States,  Mr.  Ibar-
ra  testified  that  although  its  planned  modernization  efforts  cannot
build  up  the  Philippine  military  forces  to  a  degree  that  it  could
counter  threats  from  China  alone,  they  do  represent  significant  ef-
forts toward a “minimum credible defense posture.” † 294 In February
2024,  Philippines  President  Marcos  approved  a  defense  spending
plan of approximately $35 billion over the next decade, representing
the third stage of a three-stage military modernization effort begun
under former President Benigno Aquino III in late 2012 after China
seized  Scarborough  Shoal.‡ 295  This  third  stage,  known  as  Horizon
3,  is  aimed  especially  at  bolstering  the  Philippine  military’s  naval,
aerial,  and  surveillance  capabilities,  including  intended  purchases
of  fighter  aircraft,  warships,  submarines,  and  missiles.296  In  March
2024, the Marcos Administration adopted a new Comprehensive Ar-
chipelagic Defense Concept as a conceptual guide for military mod-
ernization  efforts.§ 297  The  concept  places  particular  emphasis  on
land,  maritime,  and  air  capabilities  and  seeks  to  solidify  a  shift  to-
ward prioritizing improvements in the military’s capacity to defend
itself  from  external  threats,  a  departure  from  the  previous,  more
narrow focus on internal security challenges.298

* The United States and the Philippines are working toward the conclusion of a General Secu-
rity  of  Military  Information  Agreement  (GSOMIA),  which  would  facilitate  military  intelligence
sharing  by  ensuring  the  protection  of  classified  information  in  both  countries.  The  agreement,
which the two parties currently hope to conclude by the end of 2024, has been under discussion
since  at  least  2021.  U.S.  Embassy  in  the  Philippines,  Joint  Statement  on  the  Philippines-United

Philippines  and  its  exclusive  economic  zone  or  EEZ  with  exhibited  competence  to  defend  the
country and protect its national interests if and when the need arises.” According to the Office of
the President of the Philippines in 2023, “A minimum credible defense posture means attaining a
particular degree of military capability or enough defense capacity to make any aggressor think
twice before engaging in hostile action.” Some government sources have identified the “minimum
credible defense posture” as an intermediary step toward the Philippines’ ultimate defense goals.

§ In  2021,  the  Philippine  Marine  Corps  released  a  new  operating  concept  called  Archipelagic
Coastal Defense (ACD), which aims to enhance sea control capabilities as a means of safeguard-
ing  the  nation’s  territorial  integrity.  Some  observers  have  noted  similarities  between  this  ser-
vice-level  concept  and  the  newly  announced  national-level  Comprehensive Archipelagic  Defense
Concept, suggesting that the former may have played a role in influencing the latter. Rej Cortez

The  Philippines  has  prioritized  forging  and  deepening  securi-
ty  partnerships  with  other  countries.  These  efforts  have  potential
second-order  benefits  for  U.S.  security  interests  by  strengthening
the  Manila’s  baseline  capabilities  and  increasing  its  interoperabili-
ty  with  other  allies.299  For  example,  the  Philippines  and  Australia
have taken recent steps to build on the foundation of their Visiting
Forces Agreement * with the signing of a new Mutual Logistics Sup-
port Arrangement in 2022 and the initiation of joint patrols † in the
South  China  Sea  in  2023.300  In  2023,  Japan  and  the  Philippines
agreed to begin negotiations on a Reciprocal Access Agreement that
would  facilitate  the  deployment  of  forces  and  equipment  in  each
other’s territories for defense cooperation, ultimately concluding the
agreement  in  July  2024  amid  China’s  heightened  aggression  in  the
South  China  Sea.‡ 301  The  Philippines  has  pursued  expanded  de-
fense  cooperation  with  a  host  of  other  partners  inside  and  outside
the  region,  including  Canada,  the  EU,  France,  Germany,  India,  and
the  UK,  covering  a  range  of  efforts  related  to  military  moderniza-
tion,  information  sharing,  joint  exercises  and  training,  and—in  the
case  of  Canada  and  France—exploring  the  possibility  of  future  vis-
iting forces agreements.302

Details of Philippine Policy in a Conflict with China Remain

Undetermined

Compared  to  the  Japanese  government,  decisions  by  the  Philip-
pine government to involve its own forces or facilitate the operations
of  U.S.  forces  in  a  conflict  with  China  are  even  more  uncertain  and
will  depend  on  a  number  of  factors. The  differing  stances  taken  by
Philippine governments in the past on security cooperation with the
United  States  provide  one  reason  for  caution.  Mr.  Johnstone  addi-
tionally  warns  that  even  if  the  Philippine  government  were  to  ul-
timately  allow  the  U.S.  military  to  use  bases  on  its  territory,  this
decision  may  not  be  made  on  a  timeline  that  facilitates  U.S.  action
in  a  crisis.303  Potential  factors  in  the  Philippine  leadership’s  deci-
sion  of  whether  or  how  to  become  militarily  involved  or  grant  U.S.
military access to its bases during a conflict with China would likely
include the following:

 • China’s  actions:  One  set  of  potential  factors  has  to  do  with  the
Philippine  government’s  assessment  of  China’s  actions  during
or  after  the  conflict.  For  example,  many  experts  agree  that  if
China  were  to  directly  attack  Philippine  territory,  the  Philip-
pines  would  be  more  likely  to  support  the  United  States  mili-
tary  thereafter,  including  potentially  providing  base  access.304

with the Philippines. Australian Associated Press, “Australia and Philippines Begin Joint Patrols

News, September 11, 2023.

‡ Japan  has  also  provided  significant  security  assistance  to  the  Philippines  in  the  form  of  a
contract for an air surveillance  system and an  approximately $4 million (600 million yen) grant
for  securing  coastal  radars,  strengthening  the  Philippines’  maritime  domain  awareness  and  im-
proving  its  capacity  to  respond  to  China’s  aggressive  actions  in  the  South  China  Sea.  Mikhail

However,  absent  a  direct  attack  by  China,  Philippine  leaders’
perception  that  involvement  or  association  with  U.S.  military
activities could cause China to strike Philippine territory could
decrease  the  likelihood  and  scope  of  the  Philippine  govern-
ment’s  support  for  U.S.  efforts.* 305  The  Philippine  government
may  also  consider  the  risk  of  potential  economic  retaliation  by
China.306

 • U.S.  actions  and  requests: A  second  set  of  potential  factors  has
to do with U.S. actions and the Philippine government’s assess-
ment  of  U.S.  actions  or  likely  actions  during  the  conflict. A  de-
tailed  2023  RAND  Corporation  study  on  factors  likely  to  influ-
ence  host  nation  decisions  about  whether  to  grant  the  United
States  military  access  during  conflict  emphasizes  that  an  im-
portant factor would likely be Philippine leaders’ assessment of
whether  the  United  States  will  defend  Philippine  territory  in
a  conflict.307  Mr.  Johnstone  argues  that  “continuing  to  demon-
strate  U.S.  commitment  in  areas  that  are  vital  to  Philippines
security,”  especially  the  South  China  Sea,  will  likely  be  key  to
obtaining the access the United States desires at EDCA sites.308
Separately, the RAND Corporation study assesses that the type
of  access  the  United  States  requested  could  also  play  a  role,
with  the  Philippine  government  being  more  likely  to  approve
requests  for “nonkinetic  or  lower-end  capabilities,  such  as  ISR,
overflight,  and  logistics”  compared  to  “higher-end  kinetic  capa-
bilities,” such as long-range strikes or direct combat operations
from Philippine soil.309

 • Public opinion: Like the governments of other democratic allies,
the Philippine government would need to consider public opinion
as  part  of  a  decision  on  military  actions  in  a  conflict  with  Chi-
na.310 Elements of public opinion that could work in the United
States’ favor include a continued hardening of public sentiment
against  China  as  a  result  of  the  country’s  relentless  pressure
in the South China Sea; support from many Filipinos for closer
relations with the United States; and a widespread desire to see
the Philippine government defend the country’s maritime rights
more seriously.311 Nevertheless, the leverage the United States
has to push for additional benefits under the EDCA agreement,
for  example,  are  likely  limited.  Mr.  Ibarra  warns  that  EDCA  is
already viewed domestically as a serious concession to the Unit-
ed  States  due  to  its  similarities  to  a  basing  agreement  and  be-
cause of perceptions that the recent expansions in the north are
more focused on U.S. security concerns that those of the Philip-
pines.312  Additionally,  EDCA  is  an  executive  action  that  likely
does not enjoy universal political support among the Philippine
legislature,† making it potentially vulnerable to reconsideration

* A 2023 RAND study indicated that this judgment could be informed in part by whether China
has attacked other U.S. allies granting access. Bryan Frederick et al., “Improving Conflict-Phase
Access: Identifying U.S. Policy Levers,” RAND Corporation, 2023, 82.

† The  EDCA  agreement  was  challenged  in  the  Philippine  Supreme  Court,  with  the  opposition
arguing that the agreement constituted a treaty subject to the approval of the Philippine Senate.
In 2016, the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of EDCA as an executive action not re-
quiring Senate approval. PressOnePH, “FACT-CHECK: EDCA Is Not Unconstitutional,” April 24,
2024; Renato Cruz de Castro, “Philippine Supreme Court Approves EDCA: Unlocking the Door for

by  future  administrations.313  Other  potential  limits  to  public
support  for  further  security  cooperation  could  come  from  local
governments  and  business  leaders  who  believe  angering  China
runs counter to their economic interests.314

Regarding  a  conflict  over  Taiwan,  the  Philippine  government  is
open  to  cooperation  in  principle  but  has  likely  not  determined  in
advance  what  course  of  action  would  most  serve  its  interests.  The
2023  Philippines  National  Security  Policy  states  that “any  military
conflict in the Taiwan Strait would inevitably affect the Philippines”
in light of its geographic proximity and the presence of over 150,000
Filipinos  in Taiwan;  however,  it  does  not  lay  out  any  particular  in-
dicators  of  how  the  government  would  respond  in  a  conflict  scenar-
io.315  In  a  2023  interview,  President  Marcos  stated  that  “when  we
look at the situation in the area, especially the tensions in the Tai-
wan Strait, we can see that just by our geographical location, should
there in fact be a conflict in that area . . . it’s very hard to imagine a
scenario  where  the  Philippines  will  not  somehow  get  involved.” 316
As  to  whether  that  involvement  would  involve  a  military  response,
he  replied  that  this  would  depend  on  the  circumstances  and  what
was best for the Philippines.317 Similarly, Philippine Ambassador to
the United States Jose Manuel G. Romualdez has reportedly stated
that  Manila  would  allow  the  U.S.  military  to  use  its  bases  in  the
event  of  a  Taiwan  conflict  only  “if  it  is  important  for  us,  for  our
security.” 318 Some experts have assessed that for a country like the
Philippines  with  a  significant  number  of  its  citizens  in  Taiwan,  a
large-scale  attack  such  as  an  amphibious  invasion  directly  threat-
ening  those  citizens  may  be  more  likely  to  incentivize  supporting
actions  than  a  more  limited  attack  such  as  military  action  against
one of Taiwan’s offshore islands.319

Australia’s Perspectives on Addressing Threats from China’s

Military

Australia is increasingly focused on countering threats from Chi-
na’s  military,  especially  the  PLA’s  A2/AD  capabilities,  due  to  their
perceived potential to restrict its forces’ activity in their immediate
region while pushing U.S. forces out of the region. Australian policy-
makers  are  pursuing  military  reforms  alongside  deepening  defense
cooperation  with  the  United  States,  the  UK,  and  other  partners.
Australia’s  government  would  likely  view  providing  some  kind  of
support  to  the  United  States  in  the  event  of  a  conflict  with  China
as  being  in  line  with  its  interests;  however,  this  support  may  not
include direct military participation.

Australia Views China’s Military Capabilities as a Threat

Expert  assessments  and  defense  policy  documents  from  Austra-
lia evince serious concern about China’s A2/AD capabilities. For ex-
ample,  the Australian  government’s  2023  Defense  Strategic  Review
noted  an  increasing  need  to  defend  not  only  against  the  remote
possibility of invasion but also against the more immediate threats
from regional countries’ ability to project power across greater rang-
es and threaten it without an invasion.320 One element of this per-

Studies  Asia  Maritime  Transparency  Initiative,  February  1,  2016;  Rappler,  “SC  Rules:  PH-US
Military Deal Constitutional,” January 12, 2016.

581

ceived  threat  is  the  PLA’s  ability  to  hit  Australia’s  northern  base
infrastructure with missile attacks from air-launched, sea-launched,
and  ground-launched  land-attack  cruise  missiles  and  IRBMs.321  A
second element is that these capabilities restrict the Australian mil-
itary’s ability to defend the country’s sea lines of communication.322
A  third  element  is  a  concern  that  China’s  A2/AD  capabilities  and
gray zone efforts are designed to push the United States out of the
region,  cutting  Australia  off  from  its  most  important  defense  part-
ner and ally.323

Australian  defense  officials  and  analysts  view  the  possibility  of
a  Chinese  forward  base  in  the  South  Pacific  as  a  development  that
would increase the risks from China’s forces. Concern about a poten-
tial  Chinese  military  presence  in  the  Pacific  Island  states  surfaced
clearly  among Australia’s  think  tank  community  and  from  political
leaders  in  2018  amid  reports  of  Chinese  military  cooperation  with
Vanuatu  and  investments  in  Papua  New  Guinea;  it  has  continued
as  China’s  engagements  in  the  region  have  grown  and  escalated
with  the  conclusion  of  a  security  deal  between  China  and  the  Sol-
omon  Islands  in  2022.324  Australia’s  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and
Minister  for  Defense  Richard  Marles  stated  in  an  interview  with
the  Center  for  Strategic  and  International  Studies  in  2022  that  a
Chinese  base  in  the  Pacific  would  “completely  change  the  national
security  landscape  for Australia.” 325  In  her  testimony,  Ms.  Shrimp-
ton  explained  that  a  PLA  presence  in  the  southwest  Pacific  would
dramatically  enhance  the  range  of  China’s  A2/AD  capabilities  and
thus “fundamentally challenge and change Australia’s requirements
for [its military] force.” 326 Specifically, a PLA presence in the second
island  chain  could  require  Australia  to  dedicate  more  resources  to
defending  its  east  coast  from  air  and  missile  threats,  “tying  down
Australian  forces”  to  the  potential  detriment  of  operations  within
the first island chain.327

Australia  Reorients  Its  Military  and  Supports  Deepening

Alliance Cooperation

Australia  is  in  the  midst  of  a  major  effort  to  jumpstart  and
reorient its domestic defense apparatus to be better suited to ad-
dress threats from China’s military. Significant progress has been
made  in  a  short  time  at  articulating  a  new  approach,  although
the  degree  of  follow-through  on  resourcing  and  implementation
remains  to  be  seen.  In  2020,  the  Australian  Department  of  De-
fence  released  a  Defence  Strategic  Update  that  emphasized Aus-
tralia’s need for “more potent capabilities to hold adversary forces
and  infrastructure  at  risk  further  from  Australia,”  among  other
items.* 328  In  2023,  the  department  released  a  Defense  Strategic
Review  arguing  that  Australia  needed  to  replace  its  traditional
defense  concept  focused  on  low-intensity  regional  conflicts  with
an  integrated  national  defense  concept  focused  on  great  power
conflict.329  To  match  this  conceptual  shift,  the  document  advo-
cated  for  the  transformation  of  Australia’s  military  from  a  “bal-
anced  force”  designed  to  perform  in  a  wide  range  of  low-level,

ply  chain,  and  improved  capacity  to  respond  to  gray  zone  and  cyber  threats. Australian  Govern-

regional,  and  global  missions  into  a  “focused  force”  designed  to
prioritize meeting Canberra’s most significant military risk: great
power conflict.330 The review additionally recommended that Aus-
tralia  adopt  a  strategy  of  deterrence  by  denial  and  build  up  its
own  capacity  to  threaten  adversarial  forces.331  Finally,  it  called
for  Australia’s  joint  force  to  become  more  integrated  across  the
five  domains  of  maritime,  land,  air,  space,  and  cyber.332  In  2024,
the  Australian  government  codified  this  set  of  recommendations
into  its  first  National  Defense  Strategy.333 The  National  Defense
Strategy  also  reinforces  the  review’s  attention  to  six  specific  ar-
eas,  highlighted  as  immediate  priorities  in  both  documents:  (1)
advancing  Australia’s  conventionally  armed,  nuclear-powered
submarine capability; (2) enhancing Australia’s long-range strike
capabilities  and  production  of  munitions;  (3)  strengthening  Aus-
tralia’s  northern  bases;  (4)  improving  growth  and  retention  of  a
highly  skilled  workforce;  (5)  boosting  innovation;  and  (6)  priori-
tizing  partnerships  in  the  Indo-Pacific.334  The  strategy  was  ac-
companied  by  a  substantial  funding  boost *  as  well  as  an  overall
implementation  plan  called  the  2024  Integrated  Investment  Pro-
gram  allocating  funding  toward  various  efforts  in  the  maritime,
land,  air,  space,  and  cyber  domains.335

Australia  is  deepening  cooperation  with  the  United  States  in
the framework of the alliance.† The U.S. and Australian militaries
work to improve interoperability and demonstrate the strength of
the alliance to third parties through cooperative efforts known as
Force  Posture  Initiatives,  which  have  recently  expanded.‡ 336  Ex-
panded force posture cooperation aims to increase Australia’s role
in  hosting  forward-deployed  U.S.  forces  and  to  further  prepare
Australian forces to support “high-end” military operations in the

† Australia  and  Japan  have  also  recently  signed  a  set  of  consequential  security  agreements
that  can  facilitate  deepening  defense  cooperation  between  them  in  the  future.  In  2022,  Aus-
tralia  and  Japan  signed  an  update  to  their  2007  Joint  Declaration  on  Security,  with  the  new
version more clearly alluding to China’s challenges to regional security and containing language
that  closely  echoes  that  of  the  ANZUS  security  treaty  between  Australia,  New  Zealand,  and
the  United  States,  although  it  remains  nonbinding. August  2023  saw  the  entry  into  force  of  the
Japan-Australia  2022  Reciprocal  Access  Agreement,  which  will  likely  result  in  increased  joint
training  and  exercises  between  the  two  countries.  The  agreement  strengthens  the  legal  frame-
work  and  establishes  regular  procedures  for  cooperative  military  activities,  including  relaxing
immigration  control  for  military  personnel  and  simplifying  procedures  for  transporting  weapons
and ammunition. The first application of the agreement later in 2023 saw Japan deploy two F-35
aircraft  to Australia—the  first-ever  overseas  deployment  of  F-35s  by  Japan—in  an  exercise  that
is likely to pave the way for greater interoperability in the future. Shingo Nagata, “Security Co-

Indo-Pacific  region.337  In  2022,  the  United  States  and  Australia
committed  to  expanding  force  posture  activities  by  “identifying
priority locations in Australia to support enhanced U.S. force pos-
ture  and  exploring  enabling  logistics  such  as  prepositioning  of
stores, munitions, and fuel.” 338 Upgrades to key Australian bases
Darwin  and  Tindal  are  also  underway,  with  the  two  countries
collaborating  on  infrastructure  improvements  to  support  bomber
aircraft.339  Another  avenue  for  cooperation  is  Exercise  Talisman
Sabre,*  a  biennial,  joint  military  exercise  designed  to  improve
operability  and  combat  readiness  and  to  train  military  forces
from  the  two  countries  to  plan  and  conduct  combined  task  force
operations.340  The  exercise  has  recently  included  a  considerable
emphasis  on  complex  joint  logistics.341

If  fully  implemented,  the  trilateral  AUKUS  partnership  be-
tween  Australia,  the  UK,  and  the  United  States  has  the  poten-
tial  to  improve  Australia’s  ability  to  counter  China’s  A2/AD  ca-
pabilities.  The  AUKUS  framework  comprises  two  main  lines  of
effort: Pillar One, which supports Australia’s acquisition of nucle-
ar-powered  submarines,†  and  Pillar Two,  which  involves  enhanc-
ing  joint  capabilities  and  interoperability  with  a  focus  on  cyber
capabilities,  AI,  quantum  technologies,  and  undersea  capabili-
ties.342 Australia’s  government  argues  that  the  Pillar  One  acqui-
sition  of  conventionally  armed  nuclear-powered  submarines  will
enhance  Australia’s  capacity  to  both  deter  coercion  and  project
its  own  military  power.343  Regarding  power  projection, Australia
is particularly focused on defending its maritime approaches and
protecting  its  sea  lines  of  communication,  both  of  which  it  has
identified as being under threat.344 Key advantages of the nucle-
ar-powered submarine in these areas include its superior stealth,
speed,  and  range,  which Australia  assesses  would  both  strength-
en deterrence and improve its ISR capabilities.345 On Pillar Two,
the AUKUS partnership represents potential new avenues for the
three countries to counter challenges from China through defense
technology  sharing.346  In  her  testimony  for  the  Commission,  Ms.
Shrimpton  described AUKUS  as  the  most  important  defense  pol-
icy  choice  Australia  has  made  in  decades,  emphasizing  that  the
two  pillars  are  mutually  reinforcing.347  In  contrast,  Mr.  John-
stone  describes  the  partnership  as  symbolically  useful  but  too
narrow  in  scope  to  have  a  meaningful  contribution  to  near-term
deterrence.348

isman Saber” in years when the United States leads. Joseph Clark, “Talisman Sabre 23 Reflects

† Australia’s  pathway  to  a  conventionally  armed  nuclear  submarine  capability  under  AUKUS
is  planned  as  a  phased  approach. The  three  countries  will  work  together  to  jointly  produce  the
AUKUS submarines for delivery to the UK by the late 2030s and to Australia by the early 2040s.
In the interim, while the new submarines are in development, the partners plan to work together
to  bolster  deterrence  and  to  develop  Australia’s  capacity  to  operate  the  coming  vessels  safely.
Planned  steps  identified  in  2023  included:  embedding Australian  personnel  within  the  U.S.  and
UK navies beginning in 2023, increasing the frequency of visits by U.S. and UK nuclear-powered
submarines to Australia in 2023 and 2026, respectively, establishing a rotational presence of U.S.
and  UK  nuclear-powered  submarines  in  Australia  as  early  as  2027,  and  allowing  Australia  to
procure  several Virginia-class  nuclear-powered  submarines  from  the  United  States  beginning  in
the  early  2030s  before Australia’s  diesel-electric  submarines  are  set  to  begin  retiring.  Common-

Australia  Committed  to  Close  Cooperation,  Participation

Parameters in a Conflict Remain Uncertain

Australia’s  government  would  likely  view  providing  some  kind  of
support  to  the  United  States  in  the  event  of  a  conflict  with  Chi-
na  as  being  in  line  with  its  interests.  The  Australian  Department
of  Defence  describes  the  country’s  alliance  with  the  United  States
as “central to Australia’s strategic and security arrangements,” and
Australia’s  new  National  Defense  Strategy  calls  it “fundamental  to
Australia’s  national  security.” 349  Australia  has  decided  to  support
the U.S. military in every major conflict over the past century, which
Ms. Shrimpton assessed in her testimony is due in part to the cen-
trality  of  the  alliance  relationship  to  Australian  security  and  mil-
itary  planning.350  Although  it  does  not  commit  in  advance  to  any
policy position related to a conflict with China, Australia’s 2020 De-
fense Strategic Update describes a U.S.-China conflict in very simi-
lar  terms  to  the  conditions  that  may  sufficiently  impact Australia’s
interests  to  call  for  the  engagement  of  the  Australian  military.351
The  document  emphasizes  that  “high-intensity  military  conflict . . .
including high-intensity military conflict between the United States
and China” is “less remote” than in the past; recognizes that “state-
on-state conflict . . . could engage the Australian Defense Force (ADF)
where  Australia’s  interests  are  threatened”;  and  states  that  “the
ADF  must  be  better  prepared  for  [high-intensity]  conflict  if  deter-
rence measures fail, or to support the United States and other part-
ners where Australia’s national interests are engaged.” 352

Australian  policymakers  have  publicly  committed  to  acting  in  a
conflict  over Taiwan  and  may  be  supported  in  doing  so  by  the Aus-
tralian public, but this action may not include direct military partic-
ipation.  In  2021  and  2023,  successive Australian  defense  ministers
publicly  stated  that  it  is  “inconceivable”  that  Australia  would  not
support  the  United  States  in  any  conflict  with  China  over  Taiwan
and that the consequences of a U.S.-China conflict over Taiwan “are
so  grave  that  we  cannot  be  passive  bystanders.” 353  Joint  official
statements  at  the  head  of  state  and  ministerial  levels  in  2023  also
emphasized  shared  opposition  to  unilateral  changes  of  the  status
quo in the Taiwan Strait.354 Nevertheless, some experts caution that
Australia does not consider a Taiwan conflict as direct a threat to its
own security as Japan does by virtue of its geography, raising ques-
tions  about  what  shape  this  support  might  take.355  Ms.  Shrimpton
further  noted  in  her  testimony  for  the  Commission  that  although
there  is  a  broad  consensus  in  Australia  about  the  importance  of
maintaining freedom of navigation in the South China Sea and Tai-
wan  Strait, “there  is  yet  to  be  a  serious  national  debate  on Austra-
lia’s potential response to a Chinese invasion of Taiwan.” 356 A public
opinion  survey  in  2023  revealed  similarly  varied  views  among  the
Australian  public. The  poll  suggests  that  approximately  64  percent
of  Australians  view  a  military  conflict  between  the  United  States
and  China  over Taiwan  as  a “critical  threat”  to Australia’s  vital  in-
terests,  double  the  proportion  from  two  years  earlier,  while  an  ad-
ditional  32  percent  rank  it  an  “important”  threat.357  A  majority  of
respondents to the poll also support Australia taking certain actions
to assist in the event of such a conflict, up to and including provision
of  arms  and  military  support  and  the  involvement  of  the  Austra-

585

lian  Navy  in  countering  a  blockade;  however,  there  is  no  majority
support for sending Australian personnel to Taiwan itself.* 358 Ryan
Neelam, director of public opinion at the Lowy Institute, the foreign
policy think tank conducting the poll, summarizes the takeaway as,
“When  it  comes  to  a  specific  scenario  where  Taiwan  is  under  mili-
tary  threat  and  the  U.S.  is  engaged, Australians  feel  quite  forward
leaning  about  taking  action  to  support  Taiwan . . .  but  that  doesn’t
extend as far as putting boots on the ground.” 359

Implications for the United States

The U.S. interests at stake in a regional conflict scenario—includ-
ing  the  defense  of  treaty  allies  and  potentially  other  Indo-Pacific
partners—justify  dedicated  attention  to  assessing  the  PLA’s  count-
er-intervention  capabilities  and  ensuring  sufficient  U.S.  and  allied
preparedness  to  counter  them.  PLA  aggression  against  one  of  its
neighbors in the Indo-Pacific region could have serious consequenc-
es  for  the  security  of  the  individual  parties  involved,  for  freedom
of  navigation  through  regional  waters  and  airspace,  for  broader  re-
gional stability and prosperity, and potentially for the United States’
reputation as a reliable security partner and ally. Ensuring that the
United  States  has  the  military  capability  it  needs  to  defend  its  al-
lies, its access, and the rules-based international order in a potential
conflict  with  the  PLA—should  circumstances  demand  it—is  part  of
the  overall  task  of  deterring  such  aggression  in  the  first  place.  Ex-
panding  access,  basing,  and  overflight  (ABO)  agreements  with  U.S.
allies and partners in the region will also play an important role in
this effort.

China  seeks  to  overcome  the  challenges  posed  by  U.S.  and  allied
evolving  capabilities  and  operational  concepts  to  counter  its  count-
er-intervention.  The  PLA  continues  to  build  up  its  already  large
stockpile of offensive missiles to target U.S. and allied forces, and it
has placed greater emphasis on improving the PLA’s C4ISR and EW
capabilities.  In  addition,  the  PLA  is  developing  kinetic  and  non-ki-
netic  counter-C4ISR  capabilities  to  attack,  degrade,  and  paralyze
the  United  States’  own  C4ISR  capabilities,  which  are  vital  to  the
United States’ ability to project power. These activities could compli-
cate  and  threaten  current  U.S.  and  allied  capabilities  to  effectively
counter China’s military aggression in conflict.

Publicly  available  evidence  suggests  that  while  China  is  paying
close attention to U.S. and allied efforts to strengthen their military
capabilities,  it  is  also  paying  attention  to  any  challenges  regarding
implementation.360 Chinese observers are aware of the inherent dif-
ficulties  in  reorienting  U.S.  force  posture  in  the  region,  deepening
alliance  cooperation,  and  strengthening  the  capabilities  of  the  U.S.
defense industrial base.361 Stagnation, delay, or reversal of existing

* Regarding potential response to a military conflict between the United States and China over
Taiwan, 76 percent of survey respondents support imposing sanctions, 64 percent support sending
arms  and  military  supplies  to  Taiwan,  and  61  percent  support  participation  by  the  Australian
Navy  to  counter  a  blockade  of  the  island,  but  only  42  percent  support  sending  “Australian  mil-
itary  personnel  to  Taiwan  to  help  defend  it  from  China.”  These  numbers  collected  by  the  Lowy
Institute in Australia are comparable to those reported in the United States in 2022 by the Chi-
cago  Council  on  Global Affairs  regarding  the  U.S.  public’s  willingness  to  take  the  same  actions.
Kristy  Needham, “Australians  Say They Would  Support Taiwan  if  China Attacked,  with  Limits,
Poll  Shows,”  Reuters,  June  20,  2023;  Lowy  Institute, “Poll  2023:  Potential  Conflict  over Taiwan.”;

efforts  in  these  areas  risks  harming  deterrence  against  China  by
encouraging doubts about U.S. and allied capacity to follow through
on  defense  objectives  in  the  region.  Addressing  these  challenges,
meanwhile,  will  require  sustained  and  focused  attention  as  well  as
a commitment to balancing competing priorities.

Finally, although the PLA’s substantial strengths in a counter-in-
tervention scenario merit focused attention, they should not be con-
sidered without reference to accompanying weaknesses or viewed in
isolation.  Understanding  potential  limitations  to  PLA  performance
in a counter-intervention scenario, whether from underdeveloped lo-
gistics and maintenance systems or from other areas, can be as im-
portant  for  informing  U.S.  approaches  as  understanding  the  PLA’s
strengths. The PLA’s growing ability to challenge U.S. military free-
dom  of  operation  within  the  first  or  second  island  chains  also  does
not  imply  a  similar  level  of  PLA  capability  in  other  domains  and
scenarios,  such  as  global  power  projection,  indicating  that  there
are  still  areas  of  competition  where  the  U.S.  military  maintains  a
greater advantage over the PLA.362 Being prepared to counter PLA
threats to U.S. interests across a wide range of domains and scenar-
ios  may  involve  tradeoffs,  and  weighing  those  competing  priorities
will require U.S. policymakers to have an in-depth understanding of
the requirements in each case.

TAIWAN AND HONG KONG

CHAPTER 9: TAIWAN

Abstract

China’s actions toward Taiwan in 2024 have been intended to sig-
nal  strong  discontent  with  the  new  administration  of  Lai  Ching-
te,  a  president  whom  the  Chinese  Communist  Party  (CCP)  regards
as  a “separatist”  challenging  Beijing’s  stated  aspiration  to “reunify”
Taiwan with the Mainland. China has sustained a high level of mili-
tary, diplomatic, and economic pressure toward the ruling Democrat-
ic Progressive Party (DPP) of Taiwan, timing actions around events
both  to  undermine  DPP  leadership  and  to  extend  olive  branches  to
opposition  figures  who  signal  support  for  closer  cross-Strait  rela-
tions.  The  CCP  has  expanded  its  toolkit  of  tactics  for  intimidating
Taiwan,  including  greater  usage  of  the  China  Coast  Guard  (CCG)
around  the  outlying  islands,  new  guidelines  for  punishing  “sep-
aratists,”  and  heightened  harassment  of  Taiwan  travelers  to  the
Mainland. Taiwan has enhanced its defensive capacity through U.S.
assistance  and  its  own  internal  reforms,  with  an  increased  focus
on  military  and  societal  resiliency.  Taiwan’s  military  continues  to
take  notable  steps  to  develop,  manufacture,  and  adopt  asymmetric
systems  and  improve  training  for  conscripts  and  reservists,  but  do-
mestic factors and China’s near-daily coercion remain challenges to
this  progress.  Despite  China’s  aggressive  posture,  Taiwan’s  vibrant
and  advanced  economy  has  performed  strongly  this  year,  thanks  to
substantial  global  demand  for  its  high-value  exports  integral  to  ar-
tificial  intelligence  (AI)  and  technology  supply  chains.  U.S.-Taiwan
relations  remain  constructive  and  robust,  with  the  United  States
continuing  to  signal  and  provide  steadfast  support  for Taiwan  in  a
variety of ways.

Key Findings

 • Lai’s  election  to  the  presidency  signals  broad  support  for  his
policies  among  Taiwan’s  populace;  however,  the  DPP’s  loss-
es  in  Taiwan’s  legislature  may  restrain  the  Lai  Administra-
tion’s  agenda.  Beijing  reacted  to  Taiwan  exercising  its  right
to  self-governance  with  immediate,  extreme  rhetoric  as  well
as  policy  adjustments  aimed  at  intimidating  Taiwan.  China
escalated  its  indirect  threats  against  not  only Taiwan’s  lead-
ership  but  also  its  international  supporters  by  defining “sep-
aratism”  in  law  as  a  crime  punishable  by  death  in  certain
circumstances.

612

 • China  has  refused  to  communicate  directly  with  the  new  DPP
president  and  has  chosen  to  intensify  its  political  coercion  ef-
forts against Taiwan, suggesting that the frigid relationship be-
tween  the  DPP  Administration  and  the  Mainland  will  persist.
Rather,  the  CCP  has  shown  that  it  would  prefer  to  go  around
the  Lai  Administration  by  interacting  with  opposition  parties
and interfering in Taiwan’s political system.

 • China has intensified its military coercion around Taiwan, aim-
ing to gain operational experience, degrade the Taiwan military’s
readiness, and intimidate the island’s population while routiniz-
ing its increased presence. The People’s Liberation Army (PLA)
launched  its  second  named  military  exercise  around  Taiwan
immediately  after  Lai’s  inauguration  in  May,  as  well  as  a  fol-
low-on exercise in October, and continued to violate the island’s
air defense identification zone (ADIZ) on a near-daily basis with
conventional aircraft, drones, and balloons.

 • Beijing  has  also  expanded  its  use  of  so-called  “gray  zone”  tac-
tics—blurring  the  line  between  military  and  non-military  ac-
tions—against Taiwan  in  the  maritime  and  air  domains  under
the  guise  of  law  enforcement  and  administrative  activity  in  an
attempt  to  propagate  its  claim  that  Taiwan  and  the  Taiwan
Strait  are  its  territory. The  CCG’s  robust  role  in  the  May  PLA
exercise was novel and suggested that the CCG could augment
future PLA operations against Taiwan. The reported presence of
CCG ships around Taiwan’s outlying islands outside the context
of a PLA exercise is similarly concerning, laying the groundwork
for  a  more  persistent  presence  and  representing  an  attempt  to
extend  “lawfare”  to  its  gray  zone  activities.  China’s  unilateral
modifications  of  civilian  flight  paths  in  the  Taiwan  Strait  also
abrogated  a  prior  commitment  made  in  2015  to  allay Taiwan’s
security concerns, increasing the risk of an air accident and fur-
thering its efforts to nullify the median line.

 • Taiwan continues to shore up its remaining diplomatic partners
in the face of Chinese pressure to break ties while deepening its
unofficial relationships with major countries in North America,
Europe,  and  Asia.  Using  various  points  of  leverage  and  influ-
ence,  Beijing  has  engaged  in  an  effort  to  get  other  countries
to  endorse  its  false  claim  that  the  1971  UN  General Assembly
(UNGA)  Resolution  2758  recognizes  China’s  sovereignty  over
Taiwan  as  a  matter  of  international  law  and  to  make  state-
ments supportive of China’s unification goals for Taiwan.

 • Taiwan’s  economy  performed  strongly  in  2024,  with  AI-fueled
demand  for  leading-edge  chips  and  other  high-tech  manufac-
tured  products  bringing  about  a  surge  in  exports  and  a  runup
in  the  domestic  stock  index.  This  growth  came  as  cross-Strait
trade  tensions  heightened  in  the  form  of  China’s  Ministry  of
Finance revoking preferential tariff exemptions on 134 products

two weeks after Lai’s inauguration.

to  its  lowest  level  in  over  20  years.  Meanwhile,  approved  FDI
from Taiwan  into  the  United  States  surged  791  percent  in  the
same  time  period  to  $9.7  billion,  a  record  high.  In  April  2024,

would expand its planned investment in the United States over
60  percent  to  $65  billion  after  receiving  a  $6.6  billion  federal
grant as part of the CHIPS and Science Act.

Recommendations
The Commission recommends:

 • Congress amend the Arms Export Control Act of 1976 to include

Taiwan on the list of “NATO Plus” recipients.

 • Congress  create  a  “Taiwan  Allies  Fund”  that  would  provide
foreign  assistance  only  to  countries  that  have  an  official  diplo-
matic  relationship  with Taiwan.  No  country  could  receive  more
than  15  percent  of  the  appropriated  funding  each  year.  Coun-
tries that no longer have a diplomatic relationship with Taiwan
would immediately be ineligible for this funding.

Introduction

Taiwan’s  new  president,  Lai  Ching-te,  was  inaugurated  on  May
20, 2024, with Beijing refusing to engage directly and actively wag-
ing  a  political  warfare  campaign  designed  to  discredit  the  new  ad-
ministration.1  Three  days  after  the  inauguration,  China  conducted
a  military  exercise,  Operation  Joint  Sword  2024A,  that  simulated
surrounding  Taiwan  in  preparation  for  an  invasion  or  blockade,  as
it has done every year since 2022. Beijing also stepped up economic
coercion in the weeks following Lai’s inauguration by revoking pref-
erential trade tariffs on over 100 products, rolling back decades-old
cross-Strait  trade  arrangements.2  Despite  high  tensions,  Taiwan’s
economy  was  resurgent  in  2024,  posting  strong  economic  growth
figures  fueled  by  booming  demand  for  cutting-edge  semiconductors
used  to  train  AI.3  This  chapter  analyzes  developments  in  Taiwan’s
politics,  security,  and  economy  between  late  2023  and  late  2024.  It
is based on the Commission’s consultation with experts, open source
research, and fact-finding travel.

Cross-Strait  Political  Relations  Remain  Dismal  as

Taiwan Elects New DPP Government

At  the  beginning  of  2024,  Taiwan’s  voters  went  to  the  polls  to
choose a new president from among three political parties and elect-
ed then Vice President Lai Ching-te of the DPP to be Taiwan’s next
leader.  Despite  Lai’s  success  in  the  presidential  election,  the  DPP
lost its majority in Taiwan’s legislature, leaving the island with a di-
vided government in which the DPP must work with the opposition
parties to enact Lai’s legislative agenda.4 Beijing responded to Lai’s
election  with  protests,  as  it  had  expressed  extreme  antipathy  to-
ward his candidacy during the run-up to the election and waged an
intense  disinformation  campaign  to  persuade  Taiwan’s  voters  that
electing  Lai  would  lead  to  war.5  In  the  months  afterward,  Beijing
has  doubled  down  on  its  coercive  rhetoric,  interference  activities,
and  refusal  to  engage  constructively  with  the  DPP-led  government

614

while continuing to host and talk with Taiwan’s opposition parties.6
Lai has pledged to continue the previous Tsai Administration’s poli-
cies and expressed a desire to engage constructively with the Main-
land  while  protecting Taiwan’s  democracy  and  autonomy.7 Taiwan’s
government and civil society continue to combat the CCP’s attempts
to  subvert  the  elected  government,  polarize  the  public,  and  pollute
the media environment with false narratives.8

Chinese Influence Campaigns Fail to Sway
Taiwan’s Election
Chinese  officials  sought  to  dissuade  Taiwan  voters  from  elect-
ing Lai by denouncing him with harsh official rhetoric and likely
directing  robust  influence  and  disinformation  campaigns.  These
efforts ultimately failed to alter the outcome. According to Taiwan
security  officials,  senior  Chinese  leaders  held  a  meeting  in  early
December 2023 to coordinate efforts to sway the 2024 elections in
Taiwan.9 The meeting, which was led by fourth-ranked Politburo
Standing Committee member Wang Huning, reportedly discussed
the  roles  of  various  agencies  in  influencing  Taiwan’s  election.10
The  meeting  resulted  in  a  plan  that  the  CCP’s  Propaganda  De-
partment and a PLA psychological warfare unit would conduct in-
fluence  campaigns  through  news  outlets  and  social  media,  while
the  Taiwan  Affairs  Office  and  United  Front  Work  Department
would  engage  with  Taiwan  politicians  and  provide  Taiwan  citi-
zens living in the Mainland with discounted airline tickets to fly
home  to  vote.11  During  Taiwan’s  presidential  campaign,  China’s
Taiwan Affairs  Office  warned  voters  that  they  faced  a  choice  be-
tween  war  and  peace,  implying  that  Lai’s  election  could  provoke
a war.12 In the aftermath of a debate among Taiwan presidential
candidates  in  late  December  2023,  China’s Taiwan Affairs  Office
spokesperson  Chen  Binhua  asserted  that  Lai  had  “exposed  his
true  face  as  a  stubborn  ‘worker  for  Taiwan  independence’  and
destroyer  of  peace  across  the  Taiwan  Strait,”  continuing  a  trend
in Chinese official statements of mischaracterizing Lai’s positions
and describing him as a “troublemaker” and “separatist.” 13

U.S.  cybersecurity  firms  also  documented  a  notable  uptick  in
Chinese  state-sponsored  disinformation  campaigns  targeting
Taiwan’s  media  environment,  some  of  which  involve  the  use  of
AI-generated  content.  According  to  a  report  by  Microsoft  Threat
Intelligence,  Chinese  state-linked  cyber  actors  conducted  an  in-
fluence  campaign  to  dissuade Taiwan’s  voters  from  choosing  Lai,
constituting  what  Microsoft  says  is  the  first  time  it  has  ever  ob-
served  nation-state  actors  using  AI  in  an  attempt  to  influence
a  foreign  election.14  Microsoft  highlights  cyber  actors  such  as
Storm-1376,  which  it  says  used  AI  to  generate  memes  spread-
ing  fake  news,  falsify  images,  and  create  deepfakes  of  presiden-
tial  candidates.* 15  Storm-1376’s  online  disinformation  campaign

* Storm-1376  (also  known  as  “Dragonbridge”  or  “Spamouflage”)  also  targeted  other  actors  in
Taiwan’s  political  scene  and  election.  For  example,  it  reportedly  created  and  amplified  a  defam-
atory  video  series  about  then  President Tsai  using AI-generated  news  anchors  and  ByteDance’s
CapCut video editing app. On the presidential election day in January, Storm-1376 posted likely
AI-generated audio clips of Foxconn owner Terry Gou, formerly an independent candidate in the
presidential  race.  The  audio  manipulates  Mr.  Gou’s  voice  to  make  it  sound  as  though  he  is  en-
dorsing  Kuomintang  (KMT)  candidate  Hou You-yi,  even  though  he  never  formally  endorsed  any

Chinese Influence Campaigns Fail to Sway
Taiwan’s Election—Continued
included  promotion  of  AI-generated  memes  suggesting  Lai  was
corrupt and an AI-generated news anchor who delivered a report
containing  false  information  about  Lai.16  Blackbird.AI,  a  cyber
threat intelligence firm, also released a report that identifies sev-
eral  narratives  that  China-linked  influence  actors  attempted  to
perpetuate  during  the  election  cycle.17  These  include  narratives
that  Taiwan’s  public  is  anti-DPP  and  pro-PLA,  that  only  China
can  stop  the  United  States  from  turning Taiwan  into  a  warzone,
and that Taiwan’s independence would harm stability in Asia.18
Taiwan’s  government  and  civil  society  have  responded  vigor-
ously  to  China’s  cognitive  warfare  campaign.  In  February  2024,
Taiwan  prosecutors  charged  two  Taiwan  citizens  for  allegedly
fabricating  and  disseminating  bogus  opinion  polls  at  the  direc-
tion of the CCP in an attempt to influence the election, with one
individual  fabricating  surveys  and  another  publishing  those  sur-
veys  via  a  media  company  established  in Taiwan  after  a  visit  to
the Mainland.19 Nonprofits such as the Information Environment
Research  Center  (originally  Information  Operations  Research
Group)  and  Doublethink  Lab  continue  to  educate  Taiwan’s  pub-
lic  on  media  literacy  and  expose  influence  operations,  while  the
grassroots  civic  group  Cofacts  operates  an  online  fact-checking
chatbot.20 Taiwan’s  government  has  also  established  a  dedicated
election-related  fake  news  task  force  reportedly  able  to  provide
factual  clarification  within  four  hours  of  detection,  releasing  re-
sponses on multiple internet platforms.21

Lai  Triumphs  Electorally  and  Beijing  Responds  with  Anger

and Coercion

Lai’s  election  as Taiwan’s  president  represents  the  first  time  any
of Taiwan’s political parties has won a third consecutive presidential
term  and  reflects  public  support  for  a  leader  who  would  stand  up
to  Beijing’s  coercion.22  Lai  defeated  his  opponents  Hou  You-yi,  the
mayor of New Taipei who ran as the Kuomintang (KMT) candidate,
and  Ko Wen-je,  the  former  mayor  of Taipei  who  ran  as  the Taiwan
People’s Party (TPP) candidate.* 23 The candidates presented differ-
ing visions for cross-Strait relations on the campaign trail: while Lai
maintained that negotiations with Beijing should only proceed if the
two sides engage as equals and if the status quo of Taiwan’s de facto
autonomy is maintained, Hou and Ko both struck more conciliatory
notes, favoring the reestablishment of cross-Strait dialogue without
preconditions  and  a  relationship  based  on  shared  cultural  values
and  pragmatism,  respectively.24  Lai  won  with  over  40  percent  of
the  vote  in Taiwan’s  first-past-the-post  electoral  system,  though  he

garnered a smaller proportion of the vote than his predecessor Pres-
ident Tsai Ing-wen, who was reelected with more than 50 percent of
the  vote  in  2020.25  Hou  and  Ko  earned  33  percent  and  26  percent
of the vote, respectively.26

At  the  same  time,  the  DPP  lost  its  majority  in  the  Legislative
Yuan, resulting in a divided government that could complicate Lai’s
legislative  agenda.  For  the  first  time  since  2004,  no  single  party
has  an  absolute  majority  in  the  national  legislature  (57  seats):  the
DPP  won  51  seats,  the  KMT  won  52  seats,  and  the TPP  won  eight
seats.27  As  a  result,  the  TPP  will  act  as  a  swing  vote  and  play  a
pivotal  role  in  the  legislature.28  The  Legislative  Yuan  divisions
will  likely  complicate  the  Lai  Administration’s  efforts  to  authorize
or  fund  new  policies  relating  to  the  Mainland,  including  defense
spending increases and new weapons acquisitions.29 The last time a
DPP president headed a divided government—under then President
Chen Shui-bian—the KMT-led legislature was often able to obstruct
the defense procurement process, successfully blocking the purchase
of surveillance aircraft and Patriot missiles from the United States
from 2004 to 2007.30

Beijing Tries to Delegitimize Lai’s Win, Asserts “Reunification”

Is Inevitable

Chinese  officials  and  government  agencies  reacted  to  Lai’s  elec-
tion  by  attacking  his  legitimacy,  implying  foreign  interference,  and
asserting the result would not change what they claimed was the in-
evitable trend of cross-Strait relations toward a unified Taiwan and
China. China’s Taiwan Affairs Office immediately rejected Lai’s vic-
tory,  asserting  that  the  DPP  does  not  represent  mainstream  public
opinion  on  the  island.31  Chinese  state  media  articles  also  spun  the
unprecedented  victory  as  an  effective  loss  of  support  for  the  DPP.
For  example,  one  January  20,  2024,  commentary  by  Xinhua  argues
that Lai “only received 40.05% of the votes, which can be described
as  a  ‘miserable  victory,’ ”  and  it  means  that  60  percent  of  public
opinion  in  Taiwan . . . demands  [the]  ‘removal  of  the  DPP.’ ” 32  The
commentary  claims  public  opinion  is “drifting  away  from  the  DPP”
primarily because of its “incompetence in governance, universal cor-
ruption,  [and]  innumerable  scandals”  as  well  as  economic  issues.33
On  January  14,  2024,  the  day  after  the  election,  Wang  Yi,  China’s
foreign  minister  and  director  of  the  CCP’s  Central  Committee  For-
eign  Affairs  Commission  Office,  also  issued  a  warning  against  any
declaration  of  “independence”  and  stated,  “Taiwan  has  never  been
a  country.  It  wasn’t  in  the  past,  and  it  certainly  won’t  be  in  the
future.” 34  On  January  16,  2024,  China’s  Ministry  of  State  Security
also issued a statement on its official WeChat account, alleging that
Taiwan’s  government  and  intelligence  were  serving  as  “thugs”  for
“ ‘Taiwan  independence’  separatist  forces”  and  unreasonably  “hyp-
ing” the Mainland’s interference in Taiwan’s elections.35

Lai’s  Inaugural  Speech  Stresses  Consistency  but  Still

Aggravates Beijing

During  his  inaugural  address  on  May  20,  2024,  Lai  signaled  a
broad  continuation  of  the  Tsai  Administration’s  approach  to  cross-
Strait relations, making clear he would protect Taiwan’s democracy.

617

Lai  stated  that  his  priorities  will  be  to  continue  the  prior  adminis-
tration’s  efforts  to  achieve  sustainable  peace  between  Taiwan  and
China  and  to  continue  collaboration  with  democratic  countries  to
strengthen  resilience  in  the  face  of  challenges  from  authoritarian
regimes.* 36 Like President Tsai, Lai expressed his openness to dia-
logue with Beijing and pledged to uphold the previous government’s
“Four Commitments” for cross-Strait relations, which include cross-
Strait  engagement  on  the  basis  of  equality,  protecting Taiwan’s  de-
mocracy,  resisting  annexation,  and  deciding Taiwan’s  future  on  the
basis of popular will.† 37 He also stated his commitment to maintain-
ing “the status quo” in the Taiwan Strait while promising to “neither
yield  [to]  nor  provoke”  Beijing.‡ 38  Lai  suggested  that  the  first  step
to resuming constructive relations with Beijing could include recom-
mencing  tourism  and  student  exchanges.39  He  also  promoted  his
“Four  Pillars  of  Peace  action  plan,”  which  consists  of  strengthened
national defense, improved economic security, “stable and principled
cross-Strait leadership,” and “values-based diplomacy.” 40

Notably,  Lai  was  more  explicit  than  his  predecessor  in  condemn-
ing Beijing’s destabilizing behavior and appealing to the global com-
munity for help. He directly highlighted China’s aggressive behavior
toward the island and called upon its leadership “to cease their po-
litical and military intimidation against Taiwan.” 41 Lai told Taiwan
citizens  to  “not  harbor  any  delusions”  regarding  the  possibility  of
peace with Beijing, noting that “so long as China refuses to renounce
the use of force against Taiwan, all of us in Taiwan ought to under-
stand,  that  even  if  we  accept  the  entirety  of  China’s  position  and
give  up  our  sovereignty,  China’s  ambition  to  annex Taiwan  will  not
simply disappear.” 42 He also framed cross-Strait tensions as a global
problem  and  called  on  the  island  to  stand  with  other  democracies
in  forming “a  peaceful  global  community  that  can  demonstrate  the
strength of deterrence and prevent war.” 43

Although  the  substance  of  President  Lai’s  speech  closely  tracked
previous  statements  by Taiwan’s  leaders,  Beijing  sought  to  portray
it  as  a  new,  provocative  “confession  of  ‘Taiwan  independence’ ”  and
alleged that President Lai flagrantly promoted separatist ideas and
incited  cross-Strait  tensions.44  Lai  omitted  a  reference  to  the  1992
Consensus,  a  formulation  the  CCP  claims  was  reached  between
mainland  China  and  Taiwan  representatives  decades  ago  that  as-
serts the two sides of the Taiwan Strait are part of “One China.” § 45

† The  “Four  Commitments”  is  an  approach  to  cross-Strait  policy  proposed  by  then  President
Tsai in her 2021 National Day address. The commitments are to “a free and democratic constitu-
tional system”; that “the [Republic of China] ROC (Taiwan) and the PRC should not be subordi-
nate  to  each  other”;  to “resist  annexation  or  encroachment  upon  our  sovereignty”;  and  that “the
future of the ROC (Taiwan) must be decided in accordance with the will of the Taiwanese people.”
Taiwan’s  government  asserts  that  these  commitments  reflect  mainstream  public  opinion  toward
cross-Strait relations. Government of the Republic of China (Taiwan), Cross-Strait Relations.

§ The 1992 Consensus is an understanding allegedly reached at a 1992 meeting between repre-
sentatives of two quasi-official organizations that manage cross-Strait relations: China’s Associa-
tion for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) and Taiwan’s Straits Exchange Foundation
(SEF) (then associated with a government under the KMT’s one-party rule). The term “1992 Con-
sensus” was coined in the year 2000 by then Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman Su Chi

618

Beijing has insisted upon acknowledgment of the 1992 Consensus as
the  precondition  for  constructive  relations,  while  prominent  figures
of the DPP have publicly questioned its existence.46 In her 2016 in-
augural speech, then President Tsai had described “various joint ac-
knowledgements  and  understandings”  reached  at  the  1992  meeting
as  a  “historical  fact”  that  was  one  of  many  elements  underpinning
the  “existing  political  foundations”  of  cross-Strait  relations,  though
she did not say that any “consensus” had been reached.47

Chinese state media placed the blame for current cross-Strait ten-
sions  on  Lai  in  part  for  refusing  to  acknowledge  the  1992  Consen-
sus.48  State-run  media  accused  Lai  of  spreading “deceitful  political
lies,”  stating  that  he  was  worse  than  his  predecessors  and  calling
him  a  pawn  of  the  West.49  Minister  Wang  was  vitriolic  in  his  re-
sponse,  emphasizing  that  efforts  for  “Taiwan  independence”  posed
the most significant threat to cross-Strait stability and that “all ‘Tai-
wan  independence’  separatists  are  set  to  be  nailed  to  the  pillar  of
shame in history.” 50

Chinese Officials Reiterate Preference for “Peaceful
Reunification” but Suggest United States Is Trying to
Trick China into War

Despite the vitriolic rhetoric directed toward Lai personally, top
Chinese  officials  have  generally  continued  to  claim  in  remarks
before internal and external audiences their continued preference
for  a  “peaceful”  path  to  unification  under  the  “one  country,  two
systems”  framework.51 There  have  been  some  notable  exceptions
to  this  formulation,  however.  Some  U.S.  observers  have  point-
ed  out  the  omission  of  “peaceful  reunification”  from  Premier  Li
Qiang’s  Work  Report  to  the  14th  National  People’s  Congress  in
March 2024 and in fourth-ranked Politburo Standing Committee
member Wang Huning’s speech at the 16th Straits Forum, raising
questions about a potential change in cross-Strait policy.52 Xi and
other  Chinese  officials  have  continued  to  use  this  formulation,
however, underscoring that official policy has not changed. During
his  April  2024  meeting  with  former  Taiwan  President  Ma  Ying-
jeou,  for  example,  Xi  asserted  that  the  two  sides  of  the  Strait
should  jointly  pursue  “peaceful  reunification.” 53  Similarly,  at  a
seminar in May 2024 on the “One China principle” hosted by the

under  the  KMT  administration  of  Lee Teng-hui,  who  said  that  it  referred  to  the  idea  that  both
sides  agreed  there  is  only “one  China”  but  that  each  side  maintained  its  own  differing  interpre-
tation of the meaning of “one China” (leaving open the question of whether that “China” was the
Republic  of  China  under  the  KMT  or  the  People’s  Republic  of  China  under  the  CCP). The  1992
Consensus was first adopted by the KMT in 2008 under the administration of Ma Ying-jeou, and
it was most recently reaffirmed in 2021 under current KMT Chairman Eric Chu. Leaders of the
DPP  such  as Tsai  Ing-wen  have  questioned  the  existence  of  any  consensus  reached  at  the  1992
meeting  and  argued  that  the  1992  Consensus  framework  does  not  reflect  the  will  of  the Taiwan
public,  since  it  was  reportedly  reached  prior  to  the  island’s  democratization.  In  a  2019  speech,
General  Secretary  Xi  equated  the  1992  Consensus  with  “one  country,  two  systems.”  Since  that
time,  CCP  events  and  statements  have  clarified  that  when  they  refer  to  the  1992  Consensus,  it
means  accepting Taiwan’s  unification  with  the  Mainland.  Beijing  maintains  that  the  agreement
does  not  allow  for  different  interpretations  of “one  China”  in  the  first  place.  Jessica  Drun, “The

Chinese Officials Reiterate Preference for “Peaceful
Reunification” but Suggest United States Is Trying to
Trick China into War—Continued

consul  general  of  China  in  Osaka,  Japan,  Xue  Jian  elaborated
that “peaceful reunification” and “one country, two systems” is the
“basic  policy”  of  the  Chinese  government  to  resolve  the  Taiwan
issue.54

Beijing  has  also  reiterated  its  longstanding  claims  that  the
United States and other outsiders are encouraging Taiwan to pur-
sue independence, though it has begun to assert that the United
States  desires  or  is  even  seeking  to  provoke  a  Chinese  attack  on
Taiwan.* 55  Speaking  at  the  Asia  Society  in  January  2024,  for-
mer Chinese Ambassador to the United States Cui Tiankai stated
that  Beijing  would  not  fall  into  the  trap “somebody”  may  be  pre-
paring  for  China  involving Taiwan,  making  a  veiled  reference  to
the  United  States.56  “They  will  supply  military  assistance,  they
will supply weapons for proxy war, and the Chinese will be killing
Chinese,”  former  Ambassador  Cui  said  of  the  supposed  ploy  by
another country to trick China into a war with Taiwan.57 In June
2024,  the  Financial  Times  broke  a  story  that  Xi  reportedly  told
European  Commission  President  Ursula  von  der  Leyen  during
a  meeting  in  April  2023  that  the  United  States  was  attempting
to  goad  Beijing  into  attacking  Taiwan.58  The  media  outlet  also
claims  Xi  told  President  von  der  Leyen  he  would  not  “take  the
bait”  because  a  conflict  with  the  United  States  would  destroy
many  of  China’s  accomplishments  and  undermine  his  goal  of
achieving  national  rejuvenation  by  2049.59  Xi’s  remark  to  Presi-
dent von der Leyen is the first known case of him making such a
claim to a foreign leader, although he has reportedly delivered the
same  message  to  domestic  officials.60  U.S.  analysts  have  offered
differing  interpretations  of  Xi’s  remarks.  Jude  Blanchette,  Free-
man  Chair  in  China  Studies  at  the  Center  for  Strategic  and  In-
ternational Studies, suggests this may indicate Xi is not receiving
accurate  information  about  U.S.  intentions,  while  Bonnie  Glaser,
managing  director  of  the  German  Marshall  Fund’s  Indo-Pacific
program,  argues  that  the  statement  was  propaganda  potentially
intended to divide Europe and the United States over Taiwan.61

Post-Inauguration,  Beijing  Continues  Subversion  and

Intimidation Campaign

Although  Lai’s  inauguration  proceeded  without  major  incident,
Beijing  continued  its  multifaceted  efforts  in  the  months  afterward
to  subvert  and  undermine Taiwan’s  elected  government  in  hopes  it
can  weaken  the  DPP  and  lay  the  groundwork  for  eventual  unifica-
tion. Specifically, it conducted influence activities targeting Taiwan’s

* Signs  of  this  disturbing  trend  became  evident  as  early  as  2023.  For  example,  a  September
2023  broadcast  sponsored  by  the  PLA  reportedly  claimed  that  the  United  States  had  increased
military  assistance  to  Taiwan  in  order  to  replicate  its  “proxy  war”  in  Ukraine.  An  August  2023
story  ran  in  China  Daily  Hong  Kong  asserting  that  the  United  States  was  actively  attempting

Beijing Tries to Create Appearance of Grassroots Support for

Unification

Beijing  is  attempting  to  undermine  the  DPP  Administration  by
ramping  up  its  influence  activities—often  referred  to  by  the  Party
as  “united  front  work” *—targeting  Taiwan’s  civil  society  and  polit-
ical  life.  Two  days  after  Lai’s  election  in  January  2024,  the  CCP’s
ideological  journal  Qiushi  made  public  parts  of  a  2022  speech  by
Xi  that  extolled  the  Party  to  use  united  front  work  to  develop  and
strengthen  pro-unification  forces  in  Taiwan,  oppose  “Taiwan  inde-
pendence,”  and  promote  “the  complete  reunification  of  the  mother-
land.” 62 Director-General of Taiwan’s National Security Bureau Tsai
Ming-yen stated in May 2024 that the CCP is increasing its efforts
to  strengthen  ties  with  people  from  various  segments  of  Taiwan’s
society,  including  legislators  and  religious,  cultural,  and  business
groups.63  Director-General  Tsai  notes  that  a  growing  number  of
Taiwan  artists  working  in  China  were  being  coerced  into  publicly
expressing  pro-unification  positions  and  that  the  CCP  forces  Tai-
wan  individuals  working  in  China  to  sign  consent  forms  commit-
ting  them  to  promote  a  unification  agenda,  threatening  tax  audits
and  other  punitive  actions  if  they  do  not  comply.64  In  June  2024,
Taiwan’s  Ministry  of  the  Interior  issued  a  warning  based  on  media
reporting  that  the  CCP  attempted  to  induce  Taiwan  nationals  to
form  political  parties.65  Taiwan  celebrities  R-Chord  and  Alexis  Ho
accused  a  Chinese  company,  Beijing  Ciguang  Film  and  Television
Media Co., Ltd., of attempting to persuade them to establish a “Tai-
wan Pro-Peace Party” for the purpose of establishing “a new type of
cross-strait relations.” 66 Taiwan’s Ministry of the Interior noted that
forming or funding political parties at the behest of a hostile foreign
actor is in violation of Taiwan’s Political Party Act and Anti-Infiltra-
tion  Act.67  The  ministry  stated  it  had  knowledge  that  other  minor
political  parties  in  Taiwan,  such  as  the  Taiwan  Republican  Party
and the Taiwan People’s Communist Party, were suspected of receiv-
ing funding and directives from the CCP.68 Under Taiwan’s Political
Party Act, the Ministry of the Interior had deregistered 65 political
parties  in Taiwan  suspected  of  violating  the  act  by  being  funded  or
directed by the CCP.69

In  response  to  these  activities,  Taiwan’s  government  has  made
or  considered  updates  to  existing  foreign  interference  laws.  In  May
2024,  Taiwan  broadened  the  types  of  CCP-affiliated  organizations
from which Taiwan citizens are banned by updating the Act Govern-
ing Relations between the People of the Taiwan Area and the Main-

* “United  front  work”  is  a  way  of  managing  relationships  with  important  groups  and  indi-
viduals  outside  of  the  CCP  that  is  based  on  Russian  revolutionary  Vladimir  Lenin’s  concept  of
forming a “united front,” or a temporary alliance with one’s friends and lesser enemies, to defeat
greater  enemies.  Contemporary  united  front  work  encapsulates  the  various  activities  of  CCP
organs, Chinese government agencies, and their affiliates to coopt or coerce groups outside of the
CCP into comporting with the Party’s demands and advancing Chinese national interests as the
CCP  defines  them.  U.S.-China  Economic  and  Security  Review  Commission,  2023 Annual  Report,

land Area.70 According to the updated law, Taiwan citizens are now
prohibited from membership in any CCP organization or proxy that
conducts united front work against Taiwan or is considered a threat
to  its  national  security  or  interests,  including  entities  such  as  the
Association  for  Relations  Across  the  Taiwan  Straits  (ARATS)  and
Confucius Institutes.* 71 There has also been debate among Taiwan’s
political parties about whether to relax or strengthen Taiwan’s 2020
Anti-Infiltration  Act.  KMT  officials,  including  former  President  Ma
Ying-jeou, have called to relax the act on the grounds that it could be
used to infringe on human rights and inhibit cross-Strait exchanges,
while  DPP  legislators  have  previously  proposed  strengthening  the
act to combat political parties that collaborate with malign actors.72
A  May  2024  poll  conducted  by  Taiwan’s  Mainland  Affairs  Council
suggests  that  a  majority  of  respondents  support  an  expansion  of
the act to combat the CCP’s intensified united front work activities,
with  55  percent  of  respondents  supporting  measures  to  strengthen
the act.73

Beijing  Continues  to  Engage  Opposition  Parties  as  Political

Alternative

Beijing  has  sought  to  strengthen  its  ties  with  Taiwan’s  opposi-
tion  parties  in  a  bid  to  cultivate  alternative  interlocuters  across
the  Strait  and  undermine  the  DPP. According  to  National  Security
Bureau  Director-General  Tsai,  Taiwan  security  officials  noticed  an
uptick  in  CCP  exchanges  with  members  of  both  the  KMT  and  the
TPP after the January election.74 Notably, Beijing has continued to
host  current  and  former  KMT  officials  in  cross-Strait  meetings.  In
April  2024,  former Taiwan  President  Ma  of  the  KMT  visited  main-
land  China  for  11  days,  the  second  such  trip  he  has  undertaken  in
two years.75 Ma was accompanied by a student delegation and spent
much  of  his  trip  stressing  that  Chinese  and Taiwan  people  share  a
mutual  cultural  identity.76  Ma  held  a  meeting  with Taiwan Affairs
Office Director Song Tao, during which Song called for more frequent
cross-Strait  exchanges  and  urged  joint  endeavors  to  rejuvenate  the
Chinese nation, oppose “Taiwan independence,” and counter foreign
interference.77  Ma  also  received  an  audience  with  Xi,  who  asserted
that “compatriots on both sides of the Taiwan Strait must resolutely
oppose ‘Taiwan  independence’  separatist  activities  and  interference
by external forces” and “jointly pursue a beautiful future of peaceful
reunification.” † 78 Ma said that adhering to the 1992 Consensus and
opposing “Taiwan  independence”  are  the “common  political  founda-

* The Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits is a quasi-official government organi-
zation set up by China’s Taiwan Affairs Office through which the Mainland has formally handled
cross-Strait  contact  with  Taiwan.  Confucius  Institutes  are  organizations  located  at  educational
establishments  funded  and  directed  by  the  Chinese  government  to  promote  a  CCP-approved  vi-
sion of China through educational and cultural programs. Center for Strategic and International
Studies,  “Glossary”;  Government  Accountability  Office,  China:  With  Nearly  All  U.S.  Confucius

† China’s  state  media  have  repeatedly  published  pieces  that  condemn  the  DPP  for  its  “de-Si-
nicization”  of  Taiwan  and  carrying  out  “anti-Chinese  cultural  education”  through  revisions  to
textbooks  and  educational  reform,  accusing  the  DPP  of  attempting  to  erase  Taiwan’s  Chinese
cultural identity. China Daily, “ ‘Taiwan Independence’ Ideology Condemned,” May 21, 2024; Xin-

tion for the peaceful development of cross-strait relations,” implying
that  the  KMT  is  capable  of  engaging  with  Beijing  because  of  its
embrace  of  the  1992  Consensus,  as  opposed  to  the  DPP.79  Ma  later
described  his  meeting  with  Xi  in  glowing  terms  in  an August  2024
speech  to  an  overseas  Chinese  association  in  Thailand.80  Ma  de-
scribed Xi’s attitude as “soft and gentle” and said the Chinese leader
claimed that anything can be discussed between Taiwan and China
so  long  as  “both  sides  recognize  themselves  as  part  of  the  Chinese
nation.” 81  Ma  went  on  to  blame  President  Lai  and  the  DPP  for  de-
teriorating cross-Strait relations and rejecting Xi’s “goodwill.” 82

Another  notable  way  Beijing  engages  opposition  parties  is
through its annual Straits Forum in Xiamen, Fujian Province.* In
June  2024,  KMT  and TPP  officials  attended  the  16th  Straits  Fo-
rum despite Taiwan’s Mainland Affairs Council issuing a warning
that the event is a tool  for the CCP’s united front work.83 At  the
event,  KMT  Vice  Chairman  Lian  Sheng-wen  claimed  that  most
of Taiwan’s  populace  does  not  support Taiwan  independence  and
that  the  KMT  would  continue  to  develop  good  relations  between
Taiwan  and  the  Mainland.84  Vice  Chairman  Lian  said  that  both
sides  should  strengthen  youth  exchanges  and  are  both  members
of  a “Chinese  nation.” 85

Despite  this  engagement,  Taiwan’s  main  opposition  party  main-
tains that it is willing to defend the island’s interests from encroach-
ment  by  Beijing. As  the  KMT’s  traditional  stance  on  relations  with
China  becomes  less  appealing  to  Taiwan’s  electorate,  a  younger,
“light  blue”  generation  of  the  KMT  has  embraced  positions  closer
to  the  DPP’s  policy  platform,  in  contrast  to  the  older  “deep  blue”
generation  of  the  KMT.86  While  KMT  leaders  have  repeatedly  ex-
pressed  support  for  their  own  interpretation  of  the  1992  Consen-
sus,  KMT  officials  have  also  claimed  support  for  maintaining  the
“status  quo”  in  cross-Strait  relations,  and  during  the  2024  election
Hou publicly opposed China’s “one country, two systems” framework
for  unification.87  KMT  officials  say  they  favor  stronger  defense  co-
operation  with  the  United  States  and  the  adoption  of  asymmetric
capabilities.88  According  to  KMT  officials,  they  believe  their  party
is  better  positioned  to  serve  as  a  productive  interlocuter  with  Bei-
jing.89 Domestically, the KMT seeks to leverage its advantageous po-
sition in the Legislative Yuan to empower the legislature to conduct
greater  oversight  of  the  executive  branch,  and  it  seeks  to  increase
its appeal among Taiwan’s youth voters by focusing on domestic eco-
nomic issues.90

New  Intimidation  Tactics:  Special  Punishments  for  Taiwan

“Separatists” and Harassment of Travelers

In  2024,  China  announced  new  guidelines  for  punishing  sup-
posed  supporters  of  “Taiwan  independence,”  which  has  been  in-
terpreted as an attempt to intimidate Taiwan residents and even
foreigners  involved  with Taiwan.  In  June  2024,  China’s  Supreme
People’s  Court,  the  Supreme  People’s  Procuratorate,  the  Minis-

* First  held  in  2009,  the  Straits  Forum  is  an  annual  conference  that  serves  as  the  centerpiece
of China’s outreach toward Taiwan. Its official purpose is to facilitate people-to-people exchanges
on both sides of the Taiwan Strait. China’s Taiwan Affairs Office claimed that this year the forum
would  be  attended  by  7,000  Taiwan  nationals.  Yanyue  Dang,  “Taiwan:  Forum  Reveals  State  of
Cross-Strait Travel and How to Boost It,” South China Morning Post, June 17, 2024.

try  for  Public  Security,  the  Ministry  of  State  Security,  and  the
Ministry  of  Justice  jointly  published  guidelines  officially  desig-
nating “Taiwan independence” as a crime and laying out the pun-
ishments  for  such  a  crime.91  Punishable  acts  include  the  denial
of  Beijing’s  claim  that Taiwan  is  part  of  China,  the  promotion  of
Taiwan’s  participation  in  international  organizations,  leading  a
“Taiwan independence secessionist organization,” and attempting
to change Taiwan’s status through legal means in Taiwan.92 Sus-
pects  could  be  tried  in  absentia  and  sentenced  to  punishments
that  include  detention,  prison  terms  ranging  from  three  years  to
life,  confiscation  of  possessions,  and  even  the  death  sentence.93
Chinese  state  media  describe  the  new  regulations  as  a  “refine-
ment” of China’s Anti-Secession Law in response to Lai’s election
that  should  act  as  a  warning  to  “external  forces  who  would  not
keep  their  hands  off  affairs  related  to  Taiwan.” 94  Notably,  the
guidelines do not specify that they are only applicable to Taiwan’s
citizens  and  could  hypothetically  apply  anywhere  to  anyone  Bei-
jing views as encouraging Taiwan independence in ways identified
by  the  law.95  In  August  2024,  China’s  Taiwan  Affairs  Office  and
Ministry of Public Security launched websites denouncing a list of
current and former Taiwan officials as “diehard secessionists” and
calling  for  people  to  report “clues”  and  alleged  crimes  committed
by  those  on  the  list.96  The  sites  also  encourage  reporting  new
“ ‘Taiwan  independence’  diehards  who  commit  serious  crimes.” 97
Two  months  after  the  publication  of  the  sentencing  guidelines,  a
mainland court sentenced a Taiwan activist to nine years in pris-
on for political activities carried out in Taiwan, marking the first
known  case  of  China’s  authorities  convicting  an  individual  from
Taiwan with “separatism.” 98 Because the law effectively includes
an  aiding  and  abetting  provision,  the  new  guidelines  may  have
a  chilling  effect  on  foreign  individuals  and  businesses  that  have
dealings with both China and Taiwan, potentially forcing them to
consider  whether  the  individuals  from Taiwan  they  interact  with
qualify  under  the  provisions.99

Moreover,  Beijing  has  increased  its  intimidation  of  individuals
from Taiwan, further illustrating its propensity for coercion and un-
dermining the appeal of people-to-people exchanges. Beijing’s intim-
idation tactics include temporary detentions and random identifica-
tion  checks  of Taiwan  citizens  visiting  China  and  Hong  Kong,  such
as the following: 100

 • In March 2024, an off-duty soldier in Taiwan’s military who was
rescued  by  the  CCG  while  fishing  off  the  coast  of  Kinmen  was
detained  for  allegedly  “intentionally  conceal[ing]  information”
about  his  military  affiliation.101 According  to  the  Mainland Af-
fairs  Council,  eight  retired  military  and  police  personnel  from
Taiwan have been detained in China over the past year.102
 • In  May  2024,  a  photographer  and  author  from Taiwan  was  de-
tained  and  interrogated  for  “spreading  obscene  images”  while
promoting his books documenting the lives of gay men at a book
fair  in  Nanjing.103  In  a  separate  occasion,  a  Taiwan  national
was detained for days while traveling with a tour group in Fu-
jian.104

624

 • Taiwan tourists were briefly stopped and interrogated by Hong
Kong police on May 30, 2024.105 These incidents prompted Tai-
wan’s  Mainland  Affairs  Council  to  issue  a  travel  advisory  in
June to Taiwan citizens wishing to travel to Hong Kong.106 The
Mainland Affairs  Council  issued  another  travel  alert  for  main-
land China, Hong Kong, and Macau later that month, respond-
ing  in  part  to  China’s  new  guidelines  for  punishing  supposed
supporters of “Taiwan independence.” 107

China  Continues  to  Apply  Military  Pressure  on
Taiwan, Adopts Enhanced Gray Zone Tactics
China  continues  its  multidomain  pressure  campaign  against Tai-
wan,  attempting  to  hone  its  operational  skills  for  blockade  or  inva-
sion  and  normalize  its  presence  around Taiwan  and  its  outlying  is-
lands. As a result, a stronger and more emboldened PLA is crossing
the  median  line *  as  though  it  does  not  exist,  conducting  frequent
air  operations  inside  of  Taiwan’s  ADIZ †,  maintaining  a  consistent
presence  of  naval  vessels  in  the  vicinity  of  Taiwan,  and  undertak-
ing  large-scale  military  exercises  with  greater  frequency. Alongside
these  military  actions,  Chinese  officials  have  increasingly  disputed
the  existence  of  the  median  line  and  passed  new  regulations  that
empower the CCG to detain Taiwan vessels throughout the Taiwan
Strait.

PLA  Exercises  around  Taiwan  Intimidate  Populace  and

Enhance Capabilities

The  PLA  conducted  a  military  exercise  around  Taiwan  in  May
2024  that  was  designed  to  demonstrate  displeasure  with  the  new
Lai  government  and  practice  useful  operational  skills,  marking  the
third year in a row it has conducted exercises at such scale. On May
23,  three  days  after  Lai’s  inauguration,  the  PLA  Eastern  Theater
Command announced it would be conducting a two-day military ex-
ercise around Taiwan and its outlying islands, naming the exercises
Joint  Sword  2024A.108 A  spokesman  for  the  PLA’s  Eastern Theater
Command  stated  that  the  intent  of  the  drills  was  to  “serve  as  a

* The  median  line,  also  known  as  the  center  line,  is  an  informal  demarcation  extending  down
the middle of the Taiwan Strait. The line was drawn in 1955 by General Benjamin O. Davis, then
commander of the U.S. Air Force’s Taiwan-based 13th Air Force. While the Chinese government in
Beijing never formally agreed to the establishment of the median line, both the PLA and Taiwan’s
military  observed  the  line  in  practice.  In  the  decades  immediately  following  the  drawing  of  the
median  line,  Taiwan’s  military  superiority  made  it  too  dangerous  for  PLA  aircraft  to  cross  the
line.  In  fact,  the  Taiwan  military  also  never  publicly  acknowledged  the  median  line  until  1999,
when the PLA’s first deliberate crossing occurred. With the shift in the cross-Strait military bal-
ance in China’s favor over the last two decades, Taiwan is no longer able to prevent PLA aircraft
from  crossing  the  line.  In  2019,  two  Chinese  fighter  aircraft  intentionally  crossed  the  median
line for the first time since 1999. China’s continued median line crossings constitute a unilateral
change  to  the  cross-Strait  status  quo.  While  China’s  foreign  ministry  said  in  September  2020
that  the  median  line  did  not  exist, Taiwan’s  defense  ministry  described  its  existence  as  a “fact”
in  August  2022.  Reuters,  “Taiwan  Says  Strait  Median  Line  Is  a  ‘Fact,’ ”  August  8,  2022;  Ralph
Jennings, “What  Is  the  Median  Line  between  China  and Taiwan?”  Voice  of America,  October  28,
2020;  U.S.-China  Economic  and  Security  Review  Commission,  Chapter  5, “Taiwan,”  in  2019 An-
nual Report to Congress, November 2019, 449.

† An  air  defense  identification  zone  (ADIZ)  is  an  area  of  airspace  over  land  or  water  in  which
the ready identification and location of all aircraft is required in the interest of a nation’s national
security.  While  Taiwan’s  claimed  ADIZ  covers  large  portions  of  mainland  China,  its  Ministry  of
National Defense only reports on aircraft that enter Taiwan’s de facto ADIZ. Ben Lewis, “2022 in

strong  punishment  for  the  separatist  acts  of ‘Taiwan  independence’
forces  and  a  stern  warning  against  the  interference  and  provoca-
tion  by  external  forces.” 109 According  to  the  PLA’s  Eastern Theater
Command,  the  exercises  focused  on “joint  sea-air  combat-readiness
patrol,  joint  seizure  of  comprehensive  battlefield  control,  and  joint
precision strikes on key targets.” 110 U.S. PLA experts speculate the
drills served to improve coordination between the PLA and the CCG,
practice  skills  needed  for  both  blockade  or  invasion  scenarios,  and
intimidate  the  people  of Taiwan.111  Despite  Beijing’s  assertion  that
the exercises were a “punishment” in response to Lai’s inauguration,
Joint  Sword  2024A  was  likely  planned  in  advance.112  The  naming
convention  of  the  exercises  suggested  that  Beijing  intended  to  con-
duct  similar  drills  annually,  possibly  in  multiple  stages  throughout
the year—a suggestion borne out by additional exercises in October
2024.* 113

Joint Sword 2024A had some notable parallels to prior major exer-
cises conducted in 2022 and 2023 but included novel elements such
as  the  increased  participation  of  the  CCG,  and  on  the  whole  the
exercise  seemed  smaller  and  less  ambitious  than  prior  iterations.†
Like  the  previous  two  years  of  exercises,  Joint  Sword  2024A  em-
phasized  “encirclement”  exercises  encompassing  the  waters  around
Taiwan.  However,  the  location  and  operational  skills  practiced  by
Joint Sword 2024A varied somewhat from the exercises in 2022 and
2023. Notable features included:

 • Training  focuses  on  jointness  and  blockade  skills:  According
to  the  Eastern Theater  Command,  PLA  army,  navy,  air  force,
rocket force, and other forces practiced joint sea and air com-
bat  readiness  patrols, “joint  seizure  of  comprehensive  battle-
field control,” joint precision strikes on key targets, and what
it  described  as  integrated  operations  inside  and  outside  of
Taiwan  to  test  the  actual  “joint  combat  capabilities”  of  its
forces.114

 • Exercise locations could facilitate blockade and include outlying
islands: The PLA’s eight declared exercise zones included areas
that  would  be  crucial  to  block  energy  imports  or  to  intercept
U.S. military force flows toward the island, and two of them ap-
peared  to  extend  into  Taiwan’s  contiguous  zone.115  In  contrast
to  previous  years’  focus  on  the  main  island  of Taiwan,  three  of
these zones were superimposed on Taiwan’s outlying islands.116
During the exercise, the Fujian Province Coast Guard exercised
in  the  waters  around  the  Wuqiu  and  Dongyin  islands  “to  test
its  joint  patrol,  rapid  reaction  and  emergency  response  capa-
bilities.” 117  In  a  first,  CCG  patrol  vessels  entered  the  waters

* The  exercises  the  PLA  conducted  in  the  spring  of  2023  were  also  named  Joint  Sword.  As
some  military  experts  have  noted,  the  addition  of  a  year  and  letter  designation  suggested  that
follow-on  exercises  may  be  planned  in  the  future. As  discussed  below,  this  analysis  was  correct.

† The PLA launched similar exercises in the air and waters surrounding Taiwan in 2022 follow-
ing then Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi’s visit to the island, and in 2023 after then Taiwan
President  Tsai  transited  the  United  States.  Lee  Ya-wen  et  al.,  “Chinese  Military  Drills  around

around  Wuqiu  and  Dongyin,  reportedly  coming  as  close  as  2.8
nautical miles from the Wuqiu islands and as close as 3.1 nau-
tical miles from Dongyin before being warned off by the Taiwan
Coast Guard vessels.118

 • China  Coast  Guard  joins  PLA  in  exercising  around  Taiwan  in
apparent  first:  In  concert  with  the  PLA  exercises,  CCG  forces
conducted  a  “comprehensive  law  enforcement  exercise”  around
Taiwan’s  outlying  islands  in  a  potential  first,  suggesting  the
CCG  could  be  preparing  to  assert  China’s  maritime  claims  in
the  Taiwan  Strait  or  augment  future  PLA  operations  against
Taiwan.119  According  to  data  released  by  Taiwan’s  Ministry  of
National  Defense,  four  CCG  ships  navigated  to  the  east  of Tai-
wan in proximity to the eastern PLA exercise zone off the Hual-
ien  coast,  and  three  CCG  ships  sailed  toward  the  southwest  of
Taiwan, close to the southern entrance of the Taiwan Strait.120
On the first day of the exercises, Taiwan’s Ministry of National
Defense  recorded  as  many  as  16  CCG  ships  in  the  vicinity  of
Taiwan  and  its  surrounding  islands.121  CCG  forces  reportedly
engaged  in  mock  inspections  of  foreign  vessels  and  exercised
the use of a water cannon.122

 • No  aircraft  carrier  but  some  key  weapons  systems  appear:  The
PLA  did  not  employ  any  significant  new  platforms  during  the
exercises  and  did  not  deploy  an  aircraft  carrier  group.123  The
Eastern Theater  Command  did  highlight  six  key  PLA  weapons
systems  reportedly  deployed  in  the  exercise,  namely  J-20  and
J-16 fighter aircraft, Type 052D destroyers, a Type 071 amphib-
ious  transport  dock,  a  Dongfeng  series  ballistic  missile,  and  a
PHL-16 Multiple Rocket Launch System (MRLS).124

 • Smaller scale overall, but greater naval component: Unlike pre-
vious  years,  these  exercises  reportedly  did  not  feature  live  fire
components.125  Fewer  aircraft  were  involved  than  in  previous
years,  with  a  total  of  82  aircraft  intrusions  into  the  ADIZ  and
74  median  line  crossings.126  Similar  to  the  August  2022  exer-
cises,  Joint  Sword  2024A  featured  demarcated  exercise  zones
encircling Taiwan, while the 2023 exercises did not.127 The 2024
exercise  did  feature  more  ships  in  the  waters  around  Taiwan
than the 2022 or 2023 exercises, totaling 27 vessels on May 24,
including Chinese maritime law enforcement vessels.128

As  the  naming  convention  suggests,  on  October  14,  2024,  Chi-
na  conducted  another  large-scale  military  exercise  around  Taiwan
and  its  outlying  islands  called  Joint  Sword  2024B. 129  According  to
a  spokesperson  for  the  PLA  Eastern  Theater  Command,  the  one-
day  drills  involved  troops  from  China’s  army,  navy,  air  force,  and
rocket  force  and  focused  on  honing  the  PLA’s  ability  to  blockade
Taiwan’s  ports,  attack  “maritime  and  ground  targets,”  and  achieve
other strategic objectives.130 The drills were held several days after
President Lai delivered an annual address to commemorate the Na-
tional  Day  of  the  Republic  of  China  (Taiwan)  on  October  10,  2024,
and  Beijing  once  again  justified  the  military  activity  as  a  response
to  the  “provocations”  of  “Taiwan  independence”  forces.131  Taiwan’s
Ministry of National Defense announced that a single-day record of

627

153  PLA  aircraft *  as  well  as  14  PLA  Navy  vessels  and  12 “official
ships” (such as CCG ships) were detected in the waters and airspace
around Taiwan on the day of the drills.132 Significantly, Joint Sword
2024B also marked the first time the PLA’s Liaoning aircraft carrier
participated in military drills aimed at Taiwan.133

increasing  pressure  on  the  Lai  Administration  and  Taiwan’s  popu-
lace. China continued its efforts to degrade Taiwan’s resolve through
near-daily  incursions  into  Taiwan’s  ADIZ  while  simultaneously  in-
creasing  activity  via  its  coast  guard,  balloons,  and  unilateral  civil-
ian  flight  route  modifications  that  aim  to  enforce  China’s  claims  of
sovereignty  over  the  island  and  the Taiwan  Strait.  China’s  increas-
ingly  aggressive  activity  in  the Taiwan  Strait  via  its  maritime  law
enforcement  agencies  represents  an  escalation  of  its  decades-long
“lawfare”  campaign  to  intimidate  Taiwan’s  populace  and  give  Chi-
na’s  actions  in  the  Strait  an  illusion  of  legitimacy.  China’s  actions
represent  what  the  former  Commander  of  U.S.  Indo-Pacific  Com-
mand  Admiral  John  Aquilino  described  as  a  “boiling  frog”  strate-
gy:  gradually  increasing  threatening  activity  in  the  Taiwan  Strait
so  that  the  ultimate  danger  will  not  be  appreciated  until  it  is  too
late.137

China  Continues  Intimidation  of  Taiwan  in  the  Air  with

Balloons, New Flight Routes

PLA  air  operations  around  Taiwan  are  now  a  near-daily  occur-
rence, compared to just five years ago, when incursions over the me-
dian  line  and  into  the ADIZ  were  rare.138 After  Lai’s  inauguration,
PLA  incursions  into Taiwan’s ADIZ  increased  significantly  over  the
pace  set  in  2023. According  to  a  database  currently  maintained  by
defense analysts Gerald C. Brown and Ben Lewis that compiles data
published  by Taiwan’s  Ministry  of  National  Defense,  approximately
2,301 PLA aircraft made sorties into Taiwan’s ADIZ between Janu-
ary 1 and October 10, 2024, 64 percent more than the 1,396 sorties
that  occurred  over  the  same  period  in  2023.139  The  most  intense
period occurred in July 2024, with 278 aircraft reported over a two-
week  period  from  July  1  to  13,  tying  a  daily  record  number  of  56
aircraft set in 2021.140

Starting  in  December  2023,  China  augmented  its  air  operations
in  Taiwan’s  ADIZ  with  balloons  launched  from  the  Mainland.  On
December 7, 2023, a balloon was observed crossing the median line
for  the  first  time  on  the  same  date  that  multiple  PLA  aircraft  and
ships  were  observed  in  the  proximity  of  Taiwan.142  Throughout
December  2023  and  January  to  February  2024,  balloon  sightings
became  a  near-daily  occurrence  before  tapering  off  in  March  and
abruptly  ending  in  April.143  The  first  overflight  of  a  balloon  over
Taiwan  occurred  on  January  3,  2024,  and  escalated  to  an  unprec-
edented  scale  in  the  weeks  before  and  after  Taiwan’s  presidential
election.144  During  this  period,  more  than  a  hundred  balloons  were
tracked  flying  near  Taiwan  in  total.145  When  questioned  about  the
initial reports of balloons in December 2023, Wu Qian, a spokesman
for  China’s  Ministry  of  National  Defense,  did  not  confirm  or  deny
knowledge  of  any  flights  while  simultaneously  reiterating  China’s
claims over Taiwan and accusing the DPP of exaggerating the issue
in  order  to  gain  votes  in  the  presidential  election.146  Multiple  Tai-

wan  officials  told  the  press  that  the  balloons  were  mostly  weather
balloons  collecting  atmospheric  data  but  are  still  part  of  China’s
gray  zone  campaign  against  Taiwan.147  The  balloons  were  tracked
at  unusually  low  altitudes  for  meteorological  balloons  in  air  cor-
ridors  used  for  commercial  aviation,  which  posed  risks  for  midair
collisions.148  Taiwan  experts  and  officials  did  speculate  that  the
balloons  could  have  other  purposes,  such  as  gathering  atmospheric
data to enable PLA air or missile operations, confusing Taiwan mil-
itary  radar,  or  signaling  to  Taiwan’s  populace  that  its  government
cannot defend its airspace.149

China’s  aviation  authorities  made  a  major  unilateral  change  to
civilian  air  traffic  routes  around  Taiwan  in  January,  abrogating  a
2015  compromise  reached  with  Taiwan’s  government  and  further-
ing  their  longstanding  effort  to  nullify  the  median  line. Two  weeks
after  Taiwan’s  election,  the  Civil  Aviation  Administration  of  China
(CAAC)  made  an  unanticipated  change  to  the  M503  flight  route  in
the Taiwan Strait, canceling a six-nautical-mile “offset” of the flight
path,  which  runs  north  to  south  through  the  Strait.* 150  Planes  fol-
lowing the flight path—one mainly used by Chinese airlines but also
by  some  foreign  carriers—will  now  come  as  close  as  4.2  nautical
miles to the median line, a demarcation that once acted as an infor-
mal barrier between aircraft from the two sides.151 In addition, the
CAAC  announced  the  initiation  of  eastbound  flights  on  the  W122
and  W123  paths,  which  link  the  M503  flight  path  to  the  cities  of
Fuzhou  and  Xiamen,  respectively,  and  were  previously  restricted
to  only  westbound  flights.152  China’s  Taiwan  Affairs  Office  spokes-
persons  called  the  changes  “routine,”  stating  there  was  no  need  to
discuss  the  change  with  Taiwan  and  rejecting  the  existence  of  the
median  line.153  Experts  in Taiwan  and  the  United  States  disagree,
however,  arguing  that  the  move  was  an  act  of  “legal  warfare”  de-
signed  to  put  pressure  on  the  Lai  Administration  and  degrade  the
existence of the median line.154

China’s  unilateral  modification  of  civilian  air  traffic  routes  in-
creases  the  risk  for  miscalculation  and  decreases  aviation  safety  in
the Taiwan Strait. Because PLA aircraft now regularly fly east from
China to cross the median line, the change in flight routes provides
the  PLA  with  increased  opportunity  to  disguise  military  flights  be-
hind  a  civilian  façade,  reducing  Taiwan’s  ability  to  identify,  warn,
and  defend  against  attack.155  The  introduction  of  bidirectional  air

* China’s  unilateral  flight  path  adjustments  represent  a  rejection  of  both  its  previous  agree-
ments with Taiwan and an erosion of the rules-based international order. After Taiwan objected to
China establishing the M503, W121, W122, and W123 civilian flight routes in 2015, China agreed
to move the M503 route six nautical miles to the west; limit traffic to only southbound non-mil-
itary  flights;  and  not  make  changes  to  routes  or  implement  the  W121,  W122,  and  W123  flight
routes without consulting Taiwan’s Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA). This agreement was
made  during  the  administration  of  then  Taiwan  President  Ma  Ying-jeou,  a  period  of  compara-
tively positive cross-Strait relations. In 2018, China breached the agreement by launching north-
bound  flights  in  M503  and  westbound  flights  in W121, W122,  and W123  without  consulting  the
CAA.  Taiwan  was  excluded  from  the  International  Civil  Aviation  Organization  (ICAO)  in  2016
after  pressure  from  China  and  thus  had  no  international  forum  to  voice  its  concerns.  China’s
unilateral  adjustment  of  the  flight  routes  runs  contrary  to  its  commitments  under  the  ICAO.

traffic and higher volumes of aircraft so close to Taiwan’s ADIZ and
the  Taipei  Flight  Identification  Region  will  also  likely  strain  the
Taiwan  Civil  Aeronautics  Administration’s  capacity  to  ensure  the
safety of civilian flight in the Taiwan Strait.156

Chinese  Maritime  Operations  Aim  to  Bolster  Legal  Claims

over Taiwan

In  2024,  China  intensified  its  naval  presence  around  Taiwan
through  increased  deployments  of  military,  law  enforcement,  and
ostensibly civilian ships with the likely goals of routinizing its pres-
ence and bolstering its legal claims over the island and the Taiwan
Strait.* According to data released by Taiwan’s Ministry of National
Defense, China’s naval and coast guard vessels were observed in the
vicinity  of  Taiwan  1,937  times  between  January  1  and  October  10
of  2024,  a  figure  37  percent  higher  than  the  1,414  vessels  observed
during  the  same  timeframe  in  2023.† 157 The  enhanced  naval  pres-
ence around Taiwan is likely meant to demonstrate China’s superior
maritime  capability  and  to  force Taiwan’s  navy  and  coast  guard  to
expend  finite  resources  in  response.158  China’s  increased  maritime
efforts  are  not  limited  to  naval  vessels.  In  late  2023,  Zhu  Hai Yun,
an  advanced  Chinese  research  ship  connected  to  the  PLA  and  ca-
pable  of  operating  a  dual-use  naval  drone  swarm,  circumnavigated
Taiwan, likely taking maritime surveys.‡ 159 Zhu Hai Yun reportedly
skirted and briefly entered Taiwan’s contiguous zone § and is one of
a number of Chinese research vessels that have done so in the past
year.160

Beijing  has  enhanced  CCG  participation  in  gray  zone  activities,
providing  new  capabilities  and  enhancing  its “lawfare”  approach  to
Taiwan Strait issues. Beijing intends to provide a façade of legality
for  its  gray  zone  activities  and  to  support  its  claims  on  the  island
and the Taiwan Strait.161 For example, China could seek to regulate
global  shipping  through  the  Taiwan  Strait  and  frame  any  military
action  against  Taiwan  as  an  “internal  matter.” 162  Beijing  has  used
a  recent  fishing  incident  to  justify  a  more  aggressive  coast  guard
presence in the Taiwan Strait and around Taiwan’s outlying islands,
launching “law  enforcement  patrols”  to  further  China’s  claims  that
the  Taiwan  Strait  constitutes  its  internal  waters.163  In  February
2024,  a  China-registered  boat  sailing  in Taiwan’s  territorial  waters

* Chinese  officials  on  multiple  occasions  have  claimed  that  the  Taiwan  Strait  is  not  interna-
tional waters, instead arguing that the Taiwan Strait is China’s internal waters, a claim rejected
by Taiwan,  the  United  States,  and  its  allies.  China’s  Foreign  Ministry  spokesman Wang Wenbin
stated  in  June  2023  that “China  has  sovereignty,  sovereign  rights  and  jurisdiction  over  the Tai-
wan  Strait.”  China’s  statements  may  aim  to  establish  a  legal  basis  on  which  to  attempt  to  deny
U.S.  and  foreign  military  vessels  access  to  the Taiwan  Strait. Alex Wilson, “China Asserts  Juris-
diction  over Taiwan  Strait,  Shuns ‘International Waters’  Stance  by  US,”  Stars  and  Stripes,  June

fare,  particularly  underwater  warfare.  Zack  Liao, “China’s  Grey  Zone  Maritime  Operations  near

off  of  Kinmen  carrying  four  Chinese  fishermen  capsized  during  a
chase after it refused inspection by Taiwan authorities, resulting in
the deaths of two of the fishermen.164 China’s Taiwan Affairs Office
framed the event as a “vicious incident” and attributed the cause to
Taiwan’s  DPP  Administration  for  treating  mainland  fishermen  in
a “rough  and  dangerous  manner.” 165 A  few  days  after  the  incident,
the Chinese authorities declared their intention to intensify patrols
in the vicinity of Kinmen.166 On the same day as the declaration—
and for the first time—the CCG boarded and conducted a 30-minute
search  on  a  Taiwan  tourist  ship  before  granting  it  permission  to
return to Kinmen.167 In May 2024, Taiwan officials reported that 11
Chinese  vessels  intruded  into  what  Taiwan  refers  to  as  “restricted
and  prohibited  waters”*  around  Kinmen  island,  a  record  number
in  one  day.168  Seven  Chinese  vessels,  including  Maritime  Safety
Administration  and  fisheries  enforcement  ships,  entered  Kinmen’s
restricted waters and were suspected of engaging in a maritime ex-
ercise  with  three  Chinese  fishing  boats.169  At  the  same  time,  an-
other  group  of  four  CCG  ships  entered  “restricted  and  prohibited
waters”   south  of  Kinmen,  marking  the  first  time  CCG  and  other
official  Chinese  ships  have  sailed  into  the  waters  around  Kinmen
simultaneously.170  In  mid-May  2024,  approximately  one  week  prior
to  the  Joint  Sword  2024A  exercises,  Chinese  official  media  stated
that the intensified “Kinmen model” of law enforcement inspections
it  launched  this  year “can  also  be  applied  to  Matsu  and  Penghu  is-
lands,  and  even  the  entire Taiwan  Strait.” 171 Western  PLA  experts
assess  that  these  exercises  could  be  conducted  with  the  intent  of
imposing a CCG-led “quarantine” of Taiwan, which could force ship-
ping destined for the island to comply with Chinese rules and assert
Beijing’s  claims  of  sovereignty  over  Taiwan.172  Also  in  May  2024,
China  passed  additional  regulations  that  would  authorize  the  CCG
to  detain  foreign  ships  that  illegally  enter  “waters  under  [China’s]
jurisdiction.” † 173  Taiwan  Coast  Guard  Administration  Deputy  Di-
rector-General  Hsieh  Ching-chin  linked  the  new  regulation  to  the

* Taiwan’s  Ministry  of  National  Defense  first  designated  “restricted  and  prohibited  waters  in
the  area  surrounding  Kinmen”  on  October  7,  1992,  in  accordance  with  the  “Act  Governing  Re-
lations  between  the  People  of  the  Taiwan  Area  and  the  Mainland  Area,”  which  stipulates  that
“mainland  Chinese  vessels  are  not  allowed  to  enter  Taiwan’s  restricted  and  prohibited  waters
without permission.” The prohibited area surrounding Kinmen extends approximately 2.48 miles
(4,000  meters)  to  the  east,  approximately  4.97  miles  (8,000  meters)  to  the  south,  and  between
0.93  and  1.24  miles  (1,500–2,000  meters)  off  the  north  and  west  coasts  closer  to  China. The  re-
stricted area extends approximately 1.24 miles (2,000 meters) beyond the prohibited area to the
south  and  east.  China  does  not  recognize  the  restricted  and  prohibited  waters  surrounding  Kin-
men.  CNA, “Chinese  Coast  Guard  Spotted  near  Kinmen  after Warning,”  Taipei Times,  February

July  seizure  of  a Taiwan-registered  fishing  boat  by  the  CCG  in  the
waters  off  the  coast  of  Kinmen.174  According  to  Director-General
Hsieh,  this  is  the  first  such  incident  since  2007.175  (For  more  on
CCG  operations  in  the  Indo-Pacific,  see  Chapter  2,  “U.S.-China  Se-
curity and Foreign Affairs (Year in Review).”)

While Taiwan continues to develop and train its coast guard to com-
bat China’s gray  zone  operations, it remains outmatched  by  the  CCG.
Taiwan’s  Coast  Guard  Administration  (CGA)  responds  regularly  to
Chinese  maritime  incursions,  as  it  did  during  the  PLA’s  Joint  Sword
2024A exercise this year when CGA ships warned off CCG ships that
had  entered  restricted  waters  around  the  Taiwan-controlled  outlying
islands  of  Dongyin  in  Matsu  and  Wuqiu  in  Kinmen.176  Taiwan  has
been steadily designing and launching advanced coast guard vessels as
part of a shipbuilding project that was initiated in 2018.177 The project
aims to build 141 vessels by 2027, including four 4,000-ton class patrol
vessels,  six  1,000-ton  class  patrol  vessels,  12  600-ton  class  patrol  ves-
sels, 17 100-ton class patrol boats, 52 35-ton class patrol boats, and 50
littoral  utility  boats.178  Despite  this  investment, Taiwan’s  coast  guard
forces are outmatched by the CCG in terms of both numbers and ton-
nage.179 Taiwan also cannot match the CCG’s ability to draw resourc-
es  from  China’s  other  maritime  forces,  such  as  the  Maritime  Security
Agency,  which  has  at  least  three  dozen  oceangoing  vessels  as  well  as

To  date,  China  has  not  faced  significant  repercussions  for  its  ex-
panding  gray  zone  activities  against Taiwan. Taiwan’s  military  and
coast  guard  regularly  intercept  Chinese  aircraft  and  vessels  violat-
ing its ADIZ and waters but have not taken more aggressive action
to  date.181  The  U.S.  Department  of  State  responded  to  the  CCG’s

seizure of a Taiwan fishing vessel by stating it was closely monitor-
ing  the  incident  and  called  for  resolution  via  open  communication
between both sides, but it did not unveil any punitive actions.182

Lai  Administration  Continues  Defense  Reforms,  Pursuing
Asymmetric Capabilities and Better-Trained Personnel
The  Lai Administration  has  made  it  clear  that  it  intends  to  con-
tinue  the  military  strategy  embraced  by  the  previous  Tsai  Admin-
istration.  High-level  personnel  shuffling  has  retained  veterans  of
the  previous  administration,  indicating  commitment  to  the  ongoing
reforms of Taiwan’s military. Taiwan continues to modernize its mil-
itary human capital, improving training, launching quality-of-life re-
forms, and taking the first steps toward a new military culture bet-
ter  suited  to  modern  warfighting  conditions.  In  public  statements,
defense  officials  have  committed  to  adopting  equipment  applicable
to  an  asymmetric  strategy,  but  Taiwan’s  armed  forces  continue  to
desire conventional  platforms useful for responding  to  the pressure
created by China’s daily gray zone operations.183 The United States
continues  to  support  Taiwan’s  defense  through  increasing  focus  on
resources  in  the  Indo-Pacific  and  via  arms  sales  to  Taiwan,  but  is-
sues remain in the delivery of long-awaited systems.

Taiwan’s  National  Security  Apparatus  Maintains  Course,

Enhances Resilience Efforts

Taiwan’s  new  cabinet  signals  a  continuity  of  policy  under  Lai  by
retaining veteran security officials. Tsai Ming-yen remains as direc-
tor-general  of  Taiwan’s  principal  intelligence  agency,  the  National
Security Bureau, a position typically held by former military officers
and one Tsai has held since January 2023.184 Joseph Wu, former for-
eign  minister,  heads Taiwan’s  National  Security  Council,  a  position
he previously held under Tsai from 2016 to 2017.185 Secretary-Gen-
eral  of  Taiwan’s  National  Security  Council  Wellington  Koo  serves
as  defense  minister—the  first  not  drawn  from  the  ranks  of  retired
generals since 2013.186 Koo’s appointment is likely intended to cre-
ate a greater push for the Lai Administration’s desired reforms and
changes to the political culture of the armed forces.187

Taiwan is also seeking to enhance the resilience of its society and
institutions  to  better  prepare  for  various  contingencies.  In  June
2024,  Lai  announced  the  creation  of  the  Whole-of-Society  Defense
Resilience  Committee  under  the  Presidential  Office  and  announced
he would serve as its head.* 188 Lai’s establishment of that commit-
tee  signals  a  fresh  commitment  to  improving  Taiwan’s  civil  resil-
ience. According to Lai, the committee will enhance emergency pre-
paredness and disaster resilience by focusing on  expanding civilian
training,  ensuring  adequate  supplies  and  shelters,  and  reinforcing
energy  and  critical  infrastructure  security.189  Lai  emphasized  the
importance of the public’s commitment to resiliency initiatives, not-
ing  that  “only  when  our  entire  society  possesses  a  strong  will  for
self-defense and an unwavering confidence in ourselves can Taiwan
effectively respond to various disasters and risks.” 190

Societal  resilience  is  key  as  Taiwan  faces  threats  of  blockade  or
invasion from China. Taiwan’s handling of disinformation enhances
its  societal  resilience  while  government  and  civil  society  organiza-
tions continue to bolster its civil defense capabilities.191 In Septem-
ber 2024, the U.S. nonprofit Spirit of America and Taiwan’s Forward
Alliance held a joint emergency preparedness exercise in Taipei with
over 300 participants taking part in the exercise, which was attend-
ed by Vice President Hsiao Bi-khim.192 China-origin disinformation
efforts have been pushing various narratives designed to degrade the
Taiwan public’s will to resist should a conflict break out.193 Scott W.
Harold, senior political scientist at the RAND Corporation, assesses
these  include  narratives  designed  to  induce  doubts  about  Taiwan’s
leadership, present Taiwan’s armed forces as incapable of defending
the island, and spread fears that the United States would abandon
Taiwan  in  a  contingency.194  Experts  assess  that  perceptions  of  the
likelihood  of  U.S.  military  intervention  in  the  event  of  conflict  are
a  key  factor  in  the  Taiwan  public’s  willingness  to  resist  a  Chinese
attack and a major focus of Chinese state-sponsored disinformation
efforts.* 195  Polls  conducted  by Taiwan’s  National  Chengchi  Univer-
sity examining Taiwan’s confidence in U.S. involvement in a conflict
have  shifted  based  on  U.S.  actions.  For  instance,  public  confidence
temporarily  declined  after  observations  that  the  United  States  was
only  sending  weapons  to  Ukraine,  rather  than  troops.196  Later  in
2022, academic researchers in Taiwan found that visits by high-level
U.S.  officials  to  the  island  had  boosted  confidence  in  the  U.S.  com-
mitment  to  Taiwan.197  A  2024  poll  found  that  about  54  percent  of
people in Taiwan believed the United States would come to Taiwan’s
aid  regardless  of  who  the  U.S.  president  is,  even  as  only  around
24  percent  of  respondents  in  Taiwan  viewed  the  United  States  as
“trustworthy”  or  “very  trustworthy.” 198  Other  2024  polls  conducted
in  Taiwan  found  that  respondents  who  were  not  confident  in  U.S.
military  involvement  in  a  Taiwan  conflict  correspondingly  had  low
confidence  in  Taiwan’s  military  capabilities  and  lower  willingness
to  fight.199  More  broadly,  polling  conducted  by  Taiwan’s  Institute
for National Defense and Security Research (INDSR) from Septem-
ber  2021  to August  2023  found  that  support  among Taiwan’s  popu-
lace to fight to defend Taiwan averaged between 65 percent and 75
percent  during  those  two  years.200 The  most  recent  INDSR  survey,
published in October 2024, is consistent with earlier results, finding
that  about  68  percent  of  respondents  would  be  willing  to  fight  to
defend  Taiwan  and  approximately  53  percent  believed  the  United
States would send troops to Taiwan to aid in its defense.† 201

* A  survey  conducted  by  the  Election  Study  Center  at  National  Chengchi  University  in  2024
found that 59.6 percent of respondents believe the United States will use force to defend Taiwan
if  China  attacks,  with  31.7  percent  believing  it  will  not;  58.2  percent  of  respondents  answered
that U.S. support for Taiwan’s security had increased in recent years. National Chencghi Univer-
sity, “2024 Survey Results of the ‘American Portrait’ Press Release,” July 18, 2024.

† According  to  Li  Guangcheng,  assistant  research  at  the  National  Defense  Academy,  the  poll
results also indicated that if China invades Taiwan with force, most of the Taiwan public believes
the United States would help Taiwan in indirect ways such as “airlifting food or medical supplies
to Taiwan,” “impos[ing]  economic  and  diplomatic  sanctions  on  China,”  and “provid[ing]  weapons
and  military  supplies  to  Taiwan.”  However,  there  are  reservations  regarding  the  possibility  of
direct military intervention by the United States should conflict occur. Lai Yuzhen, “Institute for
National Defense and Security Research Survey: More than Half of the Public Thinks That U.S.

Taiwan  Continues  Military  Reforms  to  Manpower  and

Training

Taiwan  has  taken  steps  to  reform  its  armed  forces,  addressing  a
variety of issues related to training and recruitment, but it remains
difficult  for  outside  observers  to  assess  its  progress.  Shortly  after
becoming defense minister, Koo emphasized the importance of devel-
oping better combat resilience, mobilizing civilian defense, strength-
ening  reserve  forces,  promoting  defense  autonomy,  and  prioritizing
the  wellbeing  of  soldiers.202  Defense  Minister  Koo  has  ordered  up-
dates to military regulations to improve the quality of life of Taiwan
troops  and  remove  training  judged  to  have  little  practical  use  in
modern  warfare,  such  as  bayonet  drills  and  ceremonial  goose-step-
ping.203 Before being cut short after three days due to troops being
mobilized to support disaster-relief efforts following Typhoon Gaemi,
the  field  portion  of Taiwan’s  annual  Han  Kuang  exercise  was  to  be
unrehearsed and less scripted than in previous years and to feature
Taiwan  forces  operating  at  night  and  independently  of  orders  from
central  command.* 204  Exercises  were  also  to  be  staged  involving
military-civilian cooperation, including testing the ability to conduct
wartime  supply  delivery  missions  to  maintain  links  to  the  outside
world  in  the  event  of  a  blockade.205  Such  reforms  are  intended  to
address  criticisms  that  Taiwan’s  military  training  lacks  realism
and  rigor,  with  Koo  stating  that Taiwan’s  Ministry  of  National  De-
fense  would  cancel  live-fire  exercises  that  are  “put  up  for  a  show
or  demonstration  purposes  only.” 206 An  October  2023  report  by  the
Legislative Yuan’s Budget Center showed Taiwan has 155,218 active
volunteer soldiers, the lowest number in its military in the past five
years,  and  some  army  units  are  manned  at  as  low  as  80  percent  of
their authorized strength.207 Combined with Taiwan’s longstanding
recruitment  problems  for  its  volunteer  force,  this  situation  height-
ens the need for Taiwan’s active conscripts and reservists to become
better trained and more capable.208

Taiwan Continues Reforms to Conscription System

Taiwan  has  prioritized  reforms  to  its  conscription  system,  but
challenges  remain  in  implementation.  In  January  2024,  Taiwan’s
government  followed  through  with  its  Strengthening  All-People’s
Defense Military Force Restructuring Plan, announced by then Pres-
ident Tsai in 2022 to initiate a new program that would extend con-
scripted military service for males from four months to one year.209
This  program  reverses  a  decline  in  mandatory  conscription  periods
that successive Taiwan administrations had pursued since the early
2000s;  the  Chen  Shui-bian  Administration  reduced  the  mandatory
length  of  service  from  two  years  to  one  year  in  2008,  while  the  Ma
Ying-jeou Administration  in  2013  reduced  the  mandatory  length  of
conscription from one year to fourth months.210

Taiwan’s Ministry of National Defense has improved basic training
for conscript troops, basing the eight-week course on the training re-
ceived by active-duty soldiers.211 Announced reforms in 2023 involve

* Taiwan’s  military  did  exercise  portions  of  the  planned  exercises  during  the  first  three  days,
including  naval  and  air  disbursal  drills,  naval  mine-laying  drills,  mobilization  of  reservists,  and
a  “nighttime  counter-infiltration  drill.”  John  Dotson,  “The  2024  Han  Kuang  Exercise—a  Small
Step  towards  More  Decentralized  Operations  for  Taiwan’s  Military?”  Global  Taiwan  Institute,

637

more  civil  defense  training,  including  medical  training,  air  defense
evacuation, and emergency rescue training intended to enhance the
resiliency of Taiwan’s populace by increasing the number of civilian
former  conscripts  trained  in  civil  defense  skills.212  The  new  train-
ing  will  include  greater  weapons  familiarization  for  the  individual
conscript;  training  with  advanced  weapons;  and  nuclear,  biological,
and  chemical  (NBC)  training.213  Most  of  the  new  conscript  recruits
will be directed to service in the army’s new “garrison troops” classi-
fication—the forces charged with performing territorial defense and
rear-echelon  service  as  defined  by  the  government’s  2022  plan.214
The  new  program  represents  a  significant  social  change  and  could
provide additional manpower to the understrength Republic of Chi-
na  (ROC)  armed  forces  by  freeing  up  active-duty  volunteers  to  fo-
cus  on  combat  operations.215  Issues  with  implementation  of  these
reforms  remain,  however;  due  to  lack  of  equipment,  some  one-year
conscripts  did  not  train  on  the  use  of  drones  or  advanced  weap-
ons this year as originally planned.216 Questions also remain about
how the Taiwan Ministry of National Defense will manage the new
conscripts  once  their  year  of  active  service  concludes  and  they  are
enrolled in Taiwan’s reservist program.217

Taiwan Seeks to Expand Reserve System

Taiwan’s reforms to its reservist systems also aim to alleviate its
military  manpower  shortages.  As  part  of  the  2022  plan,  Taiwan’s
Ministry of National Defense was to improve the training and readi-
ness of Taiwan’s reservists.218 Defense Minister Koo has highlighted
reforms  to  Taiwan’s  reserves  as  a  priority.219  There  are  some  indi-
cations  of  improvements. Taiwan  has  launched  a  limited  expansion
of  firearms  refresher  programs  for  reservists  and  has  opened  the
reserves  to  female  veterans.220  However, Taiwan  faces  a  significant
challenge  in  reforming  its  reserves  into  an  effective  force.  In  2022,
Major General Yu Wen-cheng of Taiwan’s All-Out Defense Mobiliza-
tion Agency  stated  that  training  capacity  limitations  mean Taiwan
can only host training for approximately 110,000 reservists per year,
a number far smaller than the 300,000 reservists required to under-
go  annual  training.221  Taiwan  reservists  are  officially  required  to
undergo a refresher training course every two years, but in practice,
many  attend  far  less  frequently. 222  Taiwan  launched  an  extended
two-week  refresher  training  course  for  reservists  in  2022,  but  re-
portedly only one-fifth of eligible reservists were able to participate
in  that  program  as  of  2023.223  Furthermore, Taiwan’s  army  report-
edly does not have enough weapons and equipment to supply all of
its reserve troops should they be mobilized.224

Taiwan  Continues  Development  and  Procurement  of

Indigenous Asymmetric Systems

Taiwan continues to develop indigenous advanced military equip-
ment  applicable  to  an  asymmetric  warfighting  strategy.  While  Tai-
wan  has  made  progress  on  reforms,  its  military  is  pulled  between
the  competing  priorities  of  reform  and  modernization,  adopting
asymmetric  equipment,  and  maintaining  conventional  capabilities
to  respond  to  China’s  gray  zone  operations.  In  a  report  to  the  Leg-
islative  Yuan,  Defense  Minister  Koo  emphasized  the  importance  of

638

adopting  an  asymmetric  strategy  focused  on  “precision,  mobility,
lethality,  dispersion,  survivability,  and  cost-effectiveness.” * 225  He
has  indicated  that Taiwan  is  developing  new  battlefield  air  defense
systems, high-performance naval ships, prototype submarines, vari-
ous  drone  types,  and  precision  munitions  such  as  the  Hsiung  Feng
IIE  land-attack  cruise  missiles  and Wan  Chien  air-to-ground  cruise
missiles.† 226 Specific examples of capabilities that would further an
asymmetric warfighting strategy include:

 • Corvettes:  In  March  2024,  Taiwan’s  navy  commissioned  four
Tuo  Chiang-class  corvettes  equipped  with  anti-ship  and
anti-air  missiles  as  well  as  stealth  capabilities.227  Taiwan
currently  has  six  of  the  corvettes  and  hopes  to  have  11  by
2026.228

 • Drones:  Taiwan  is  in  the  process  of  acquiring  an  initial  3,225
micro  and  small  military  drones  from  local  suppliers  by  2025,
making  progress  toward  the  goals  of  sourcing  from  domestic
suppliers a fleet of 7,000 commercial and 700 military drones by
2028,  as  laid  out  in Taiwan’s  2023  National  Defense  Report.229
However, Taiwan’s indigenous drone program faces problems in
some  areas;  for  example,  its  Teng  Yun  drone,  first  unveiled  in
2015, is still undergoing testing.230

 • Anti-drone  system:  Taiwan  also  recently  integrated  a  new
electronic warfare anti-drone weapon into its armed forces in
late  February  2024,  part  of  a  $146  million  program  aimed  at
strengthening  defense  capabilities  across  Taiwan’s  military
bases  and  countering  Chinese  drone  intrusions  over  its  out-
lying  islands.231

 • A  new  military  innovation  unit:  Defense  Minister  Koo  also  an-
nounced the creation of a new military technology development
unit  modeled  after  the  U.S.  Defense  Innovation  Unit.‡ 232  The
new  unit,  which  will  report  directly  to  Koo,  will  work  to  com-
bine  the  resources  and  capabilities  of  the  Ministry  of  National
Defense’s top research unit, the National Chung-Shan Institute
of  Science  and  Technology  (NCSIST),  with  those  of  other  civil-
ian-run defense technology companies.233 Instead of attempting
to  develop  defense  technology  from  scratch,  the  new  unit  will
instead  focus  on  investing  in  proven  defense  technologies  such
as next-generation drones and unmanned ships.234 NCSIST has

* In August, Taiwan’s  Ministry  of  National  Defense  announced  it  would  be  retiring  over  1,000
aging  vehicles  and  weapons  systems  between  2024  and  2028,  including  M41D  tanks,  CM24  ar-
mored  vehicles,  and  F-5  jets,  some  of  which  had  been  in  service  for  over  50  years. The  Ministry
of  National  Defense  claimed  that  the  decommissioning  of  the  systems  will  result  in  savings  of
$98.6  million.  Focus  Taiwan,  “Taiwan  Military  to  Retire  M41D  Tanks,  CM24  Armored  Vehicles,

vests scheduled for delivery in 2025, built to U.S. military standards and reportedly able to with-
stand  hits  from  standard-issue  PLA  bullets.  Taiwan  has  also  ordered  80,000  new  T112  assault
rifles  for  use  by Taiwan’s  army,  reserves,  and  military  police  that  are  set  for  delivery  from  2025
to  2028.  The  newly  developed  rifles  feature  a  standard  optical  sight  and  increased  range  and

 Taiwan’s defense spending as a share of its gross domestic prod-
uct (GDP) has remained steady even as it continues to increase the
nominal  total.  In  August  2024,  the  Lai  Administration  proposed  a
2025  defense  budget  7.7  percent  larger  than  the  previous  year,  at
$20.2 billion, a record high.236 Although an increase in gross spend-
ing, this proposed budget would amount to 2.45 percent of Taiwan’s
GDP,  a  slight  decrease  from  the  previous  two  years’  budgets  that
had  rates  closer  to  2.5  percent  of  GDP.237  Hsieh  Chi-hsien,  head  of
the  Ministry  of  National  Defense’s  Comptroller  Bureau,  notes  that
increasing the budget to 3 percent of GDP remains a goal, but does
not  give  a  timeline.238  The  proposal  includes  funding  for  the  man-
ufacture  of  seven  additional  indigenous  submarines  and  a  special
fund for local development and production of missiles.239

Taiwan Learns Lessons from Russia’s War in Ukraine

Taiwan continues to observe the Ukraine conflict for lessons that
may  apply  in  the  case  of  Chinese  military  action.  The  conflict  in
Ukraine  gave  Taiwan  greater  impetus  to  reform  its  reservist  sys-
tem,  enhance  reservist  training,  and  better  incorporate  reservists
into  defense  plans.240  In  the  summer  of  2022,  following  Russia’s
invasion  of  Ukraine,  reservists  were  featured  in  Taiwan’s  annual
Han  Kuang  exercise  and  have  been  involved  in  subsequent  annual
exercises.241 Taiwan’s  2023  National  Defense  Report  notes  that  the
war  in  Ukraine  underscores  the  importance  of  energy  security  and
Taiwan’s  vulnerability  to  disruptions  of  the  international  food  mar-
ket, energy imports, and supply chains for military materiel.242 The
report specifically cites the conflict in Ukraine as the reason for the
Taiwan  government’s  renewed  emphasis  on  civil-military  coordina-
tion and the publication of All-Out Defense Handbooks in 2022 and
2023.243  The  expansion  of  Taiwan’s  annual  Wan  An  air  raid  drill
and  enhanced  efforts  to  build  its  drone  fleet  have  also  reportedly
occurred in response to lessons learned from Ukraine.244

Taiwan has begun a program to launch its own communications
satellites to ensure connection to the outside world in the event of
Chinese  military  action,  inspired  by  the  role  that  SpaceX’s  Star-
link  constellation  has  played  in  Ukraine’s  defense.245  Similar  to
Starlink, Taiwan’s  system  would  provide  internet  access  through
low  Earth  orbit  (LEO)  satellites,  allowing  individuals  to  tap  into
the  data  link  emitted  from  overhead  satellites  for  a  variety  of
purposes,  including  civilian  communication  as  well  as  military
command  and  control.246  In  2023,  then  President  Tsai  pledged
an additional $1.3 billion to Taiwan’s space program, which aims
to  begin  launching  its  first  dedicated  communication  satellite  by
2026.247  Taiwan’s  Ministry  of  Digital  Affairs  announced  in  July
2024 that LEO and medium earth orbit satellite signals now cov-
er  all  of  Taiwan  and  its  outlying  islands.248  The  ministry  also
tested  LEO  satellites’  connectivity  to  over  700  ground  terminals
enabling military and government users to maintain communica-
tion capabilities during emergencies for a period of 12 hours each
day  via  commercial  satellites.249

The United States Continues to Provide Support for Taiwan’s

Defense

The United States continues to support Taiwan’s defense through
arms  sales  (see  Appendix  II)  and  foreign  military  financing  path-
ways.  Regarding  priority  acquisitions  from  the  United  States,  De-
fense Minister Koo outlined plans to Taiwan’s legislature to procure
Patriot  III  Extended  Range  air  defense  missiles,  Harpoon  precision
strike systems, Exocet missile coastal defense systems, F-16V fight-
ers,  and  other  long-range  precision  weapons  for  air,  land,  and  mar-
itime  targets.250  A  slate  of  man-portable  anti-air  and  anti-armor
munitions  ordered  in  2015  is  expected  to  be  delivered  to  Taiwan
by  the  end  of  this  calendar  year.251  In  a  significant  boost  to  Tai-
wan’s  asymmetric  systems  inventory,  the  U.S.  Department  of  State
announced in June 2024 that it had approved the sale of over 1,000
loitering  munitions  for  sale  to  Taiwan  to  be  delivered  by  the  end
of  2025.252  However,  Taiwan  also  remains  committed  to  building
expensive,  conventional  systems,  such  as  the  Yushan-class  landing
platform  docks,  commissioning  the  first  such  vessel  in  2022  with
a  total  of  four  planned.253  Taiwan’s  anticipated  delivery  of  F-16V
fighters and Abrams tanks are also of questionable applicability to-
ward an asymmetric strategy and make up over half of the current
backlog of arms sales to Taiwan.254

Despite U.S. support, significant challenges remain with the back-
log of arms that have been ordered but not yet delivered. The back-
log  of  U.S.  arms  sales  to Taiwan  is  currently  estimated  at  over  $19
billion  in  gross  value.255  According  to  analysis  conducted  by  the
CATO Institute, 55 percent ($10.87 billion) of the backlog’s value is
for capabilities considered “traditional” (e.g., F-16V, M1A2T Abrams
tanks) rather than those supporting an “asymmetric” strategy (e.g.,
Harpoon  coastal  defense  system,  HIMARS,*  and  munitions).256  For
example,  two  U.S.-made  MQ-9B  SkyGuardian  drones,  originally  or-
dered in 2020, are not set for delivery until 2026, with another pair
slated for 2027.257 The MQ-9Bs are a platform that could also assist
Taiwan  in  countering  China’s  gray  zone  campaign  by  monitoring
Chinese  naval  assets.  In  addition  to  delays  resulting  from  limita-
tions  in  the  U.S.  defense  industrial  base,  a  House  Foreign  Affairs
Committee  Foreign  Military  Sales  TIGER  Task  Force  report  pub-

with  increases  in  costs  of  advanced  systems  over  time,  causing  far

lack  of  a  sense  of  urgency  among  relevant  agencies,  as  well  as  the
time  it  takes  to  reconfigure  weapons  systems  to  comply  with  U.S.
export policy.* 260

The task force and Administration officials find that another criti-
cal factor contributing to weapons delays are systemic issues within
the U.S. defense industry itself.261 Consolidation across the defense
industry has left fewer suppliers and production lines to meet grow-
ing demand for U.S. weapons abroad, a challenge that has been ex-
acerbated  by  complex  production  processes  and  long  supply  chains
that  are  vulnerable  to  disruption.262  Inconsistent  demand  signals
from  the  U.S.  government  due  to  yearly  budget  uncertainty  and
continuing  resolutions  have  led  defense  manufacturers  to  purpose-
ly  refrain  from  investing  in  greater  manufacturing  capacity  lest  an
anticipated demand fail to materialize.263 In an attempt to address
these delays and long delivery timelines, Taiwan has increased pro-
duction of indigenous systems and is exploring munitions co-produc-
tion.264  (For  more  information  on  the  U.S.  defense  industrial  base,
see  Chapter  8, “China’s  Evolving  Counter-Intervention  Capabilities
and  the  Role  of  Indo-Pacific  Allies.”)  Taiwan  is  in  the  early  stages
of  partnering  with  U.S.  defense  contractor  Northrop  Grumman  to
produce 30 mm munitions on-island under license.265

Prominent  leaders  in  Taiwan  have  called  for  closer  cooperation
with  the  United  States  to  help  Taiwan  produce  and  procure  the
weapons  necessary  for  effective  deterrence  and  defense.  In  May
2024, Taiwan’s  then Vice  President-elect,  Hsiao  Bi-khim,  suggested
that Taiwan  and  the  United  States  enter  into  a  Security  of  Supply
Arrangement,  an  idea  that  was  also  endorsed  by Taiwan’s  minister
of  foreign  affairs  at  the  time,  Joseph Wu.266  Security  of  Supply Ar-
rangements aim to “ensure the mutual supply of defense goods and
services”  by  encouraging  partner  nations  “to  acquire  defense  goods
from  each  other,  promote  interoperability,  and  provide  assurance  of
timely delivery during peacetime, emergency, and armed conflict.” 267
The United States currently maintains Security of Supply Arrange-
ments  with  18  countries,  including  Indo-Pacific  countries  such  as
India, Japan, Korea, Australia, and Singapore.† 268

In  2024,  U.S.  lawmakers  continued  to  seek  new  pathways  to  pro-
vide  for  the  defense  of  Taiwan  while  reducing  the  backlog  of  arms
sales to Taiwan’s military. The Further Consolidated Appropriations
Act  2024  makes  available  no  less  than  $300  million  in  foreign  mil-
itary  financing  (FMF)  for  Taiwan.269  Separate  emergency  supple-
mental appropriations for fiscal year (FY) 2024 include $8.12 billion
to  strengthen  U.S.  military  capabilities  and  infrastructure  in  the
Indo-Pacific  and  assist  Taiwan  and  other  regional  partners  in  de-
terring China.270 This includes $1.9 billion specifically for replacing

fusion and inefficiency in FMS cases globally. House Foreign Affairs Committee, Foreign Military

and $2 billion in FMF for the Indo-Pacific region as a whole, of which
Taiwan could be a recipient.271 This emergency supplemental could
enable  the  Biden  Administration  to  authorize  further  Presidential
Drawdown  Authority  (PDA)  transfers  to  Taiwan  now  that  the  U.S.
military has funding to backfill any transferred equipment.272 PDA
use  by  the  Administration  is  unlikely  to  significantly  reduce  Tai-
wan’s arms sale backlog, however, as it is not applicable to the big-
gest-ticket  items  on  backlog.273  PDA  only  enables  the  Administra-
tion  to  send  defense  articles  that  are  already  in  the  U.S.  military’s
inventory.274 Taiwan’s F-16V aircraft, which make up approximately
40 percent of the backlog, are not applicable to PDA, as that variant
is not in U.S. military inventory and is still being manufactured for
Taiwan.275

Taiwan  Advances  Unofficial  Ties  while  Beijing
Works to Build Support for Its Territorial Claim
Taiwan  began  the  year  with  a  critical  election  that  had  global
ramifications.  Immediately  after  Lai’s  election,  Beijing  intensified
its international campaign designed to further diplomatically isolate
Taiwan. In response to international support for Taiwan, China has
become  increasingly  vocal  in  its  protestations  and  heavy-handed  in
its  approach.  Beijing’s  strategy  has  evolved,  with  Chinese  officials
now  more  blatant  in  their  deliberate  misrepresentation  of  interna-
tional  law  and  diplomatic  agreements  that  serve  their  claim  that
Taiwan is an inalienable part of China.

Beijing’s  International  Diplomacy  Seeks  to  Isolate  Taiwan,

Build Support for “Reunification”

Taiwan  continues  to  lose  diplomatic  allies  as  a  result  of  Chinese
pressure to switch diplomatic recognition. Immediately after the re-
sults  of  Taiwan’s  presidential  election  were  announced  in  January
2024,  the  country  of  Nauru  switched  diplomatic  recognition  from
the  ROC  to  the  People’s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  in  a  move  that
was likely purposefully timed to be announced after the election.276
Taiwan’s  Central  News Agency  (CNA)  claimed  the  switch  was  con-
nected  to  a  funding  shortfall  related  to  the Australian  immigration
detention  facility  Nauru  hosts.277  Prior  to  the  switch,  CNA  claims
Nauru  had  asked  Taiwan  for  $83.23  million  to  keep  the  facility
open.278  (For  more  on  China’s  engagement  with  Pacific  Islands,  see
Chapter  2,  “U.S.-China  Security  and  Foreign  Affairs  (Year  in  Re-
view).”) Taiwan is now left with 12 diplomatic partners in a contin-
uation of a trend that Beijing accelerated in 2016 after the election
of Tsai, when Taiwan had formal relations with 22 countries.* 279

Beijing  has  been  campaigning  internationally  to  conflate  various
countries’  “One  China  policy”  with  its  own  “One  China  principle,”
accusing U.S. officials of violating the “One China principle” despite
the  United  States  never  endorsing  Beijing’s  viewpoint.† 280  (For  a

† China’s “One  China  principle”  refers  to  the  Chinese  government’s  position  that Taiwan  is  an

discussion  of  the  differences  between  Beijing’s  “One  China  princi-
ple”  and  the  U.S. “One  China  policy,”  see Appendix  I.)  For  example,
the  Chinese  consulate  in  Los  Angeles  directly  misrepresented  the
United  States’  position  in  a  May  2024  statement,  falsely  writing
that  the  United  States  “recognizes”  China’s  position  that  there  is
only  one  China  and Taiwan  is  part  of  China.* 281 That  same  state-
ment  falsely  claimed  that  every  nation  that  established  diplomatic
relations  with  Beijing  has  endorsed  its  “One  China  principle”  and
that the principle is universally recognized.282 Chinese government
officials  routinely  accuse  the  United  States  of  violating  the  “One
China principle” for actions such as defense sales to Taiwan despite
the United States never agreeing to the principle.283 In a similar ex-
ample,  China  misleadingly  portrayed  Ireland  as  in  agreement  with
its “One  China  principle”  during  a  recent  meeting  between  leaders.
According  to  the  Chinese  readout  of  a  January  2024  meeting  be-
tween  Irish  Prime  Minister  Leo Varadkar  and  Chinese  Premier  Li,
Varadkar  stated  that  Ireland  abides  by  the  “One  China  principle”
and  that  he  “hopes  that  China  will  achieve  peaceful  reunification
at  an  early  date.” 284  Varadkar  later  corrected  the  record  however,
stating that at the meeting he had instead reaffirmed Ireland’s One
China “policy.” 285

In an important departure from the past, in 2024 Beijing also be-
gan  to  actively  cultivate  support  from  other  countries  for  Taiwan’s
“reunification” with the Mainland. (For more on Beijing’s use of “re-
unification,”  see  Appendix  I.)  No  longer  satisfied  with  states  just
voicing support for the “One China principle,” China has apparently
begun  persuading  countries  to  make  statements  endorsing  China’s
“national reunification.” 286 This strategy has been evident in several
statements between Chinese officials and foreign leaders, particular-
ly  in  countries  looking  to  China  for  economic  development.287  In  a
statement during Chinese Premier Li’s visit to Malaysia on June 20,
for  example,  Prime  Minister  Anwar  Ibrahim  said  that  his  country
firmly supports China in “achieving national reunification.” 288 King
Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa of Bahrain has said he supports “peaceful
reunification,”  while  leaders  from  Equatorial  Guinea,  Egypt,  Paki-
stan, and Suriname have said  they support “reunification” or  “com-
plete reunification” without reference to peaceful conditions.289 After
separate  meetings  between  Xi  and  their  respective  heads  of  state
this year, the Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, and the Federated States of
Micronesia all expressed support for China’s “national reunification,”
while Fiji reaffirmed “its adherence to the one-China principle.” 290

ties  with  Beijing  and  unofficial  ties  with Taiwan  often  use  the  phrase “One  China  policy”  to  de-
scribe  their  own  stance  of  officially  recognizing  the  PRC  while  simultaneously  recognizing  that
the  interpretation  of  “One  China”  is  up  for  debate.  The  United  States  maintains  its  own  “One
China  policy”  that  similarly  recognizes  the  PRC  as  the  sole  legal  government  of  China,  but  it
does  not  endorse—it  only  acknowledges—Beijing’s  position  that Taiwan  is  a  part  of  China,  with
the expectation that cross-Strait differences would be resolved peacefully. (For a fuller discussion
of Beijing’s “One China policy,” see Appendix I.) Amrita Jash, “The ‘One China Principle’: China’s

Beijing’s Efforts to Distort UNGA Resolution 2758

Beijing  has  consistently  misrepresented  the  meaning  of  UN
General  Assembly  (UNGA)  Resolution  2758,  asserting  the  res-
olution  provides  a  basis  in  international  law  for  its  claim  that
Taiwan is a part of China. The UNGA passed Resolution 2758 on
October  25,  1971,  recognizing  the  representatives  of  the  govern-
ment of the PRC as the “only legitimate representatives of China
to  the  United  Nations”  while  simultaneously  “expel[ling] . . .  the
representatives  of  Chiang  Kai-shek”  (i.e.,  representatives  from
Taipei’s  government)  from  China’s  seat  at  the  UN.291  Because
member  states  were  unable  to  reach  a  conclusion  regarding  the
legal status of Taiwan, Resolution 2758 solely addressed the ques-
tion of China’s representation in the UN and did not address the
question  of  Taiwan’s  sovereignty.292  Nonetheless,  Beijing  has  in-
creasingly asserted that Resolution 2758 endorses China’s sover-
eignty  over  Taiwan.293  According  to  a  spokesperson  for  China’s
permanent  mission  to  the  UN  in  2020,  “Resolution  2758  of  the
UN General Assembly has restored the lawful seat of the People’s
Republic  of  China  at  the  UN  and  affirmed  the  one-China  princi-
ple  at  the  Organization,  which  has  been  strictly  observed  across
the  UN  system  and  widely  respected  by  UN  Member  States.” 294
Beijing  has  used  its  influence  to  require  official  UN  references
to  Taiwan  to  be  written  as  “Taiwan,  Province  of  China”  or  refer
to Taiwan  as  an “integral  part”  of  China.295  Beijing  also  invokes
Resolution  2758  to  justify  denying Taiwan’s  international  partic-
ipation  in  the  UN  or  any  other  international  organization  whose
membership  is  confined  to  sovereign  states.296  Beijing  pressures
countries  with  which  it  maintains  an  official  relationship  to  en-
dorse its interpretation of UNGA Resolution 2758. When the gov-
ernment  of  Nauru  officially  switched  its  recognition  to  the  PRC
in  January  2024,  its  statement  specifically  invoked  Resolution
2758.297  If  Beijing  is  successful  in  propagating  its  interpretation
of  Resolution  2758  as  analogous  to  its  “One  China  principle,”  it
may be able to more convincingly justify the use of force or coer-
cion against Taiwan as lawful.298

Beijing Attempts to Deter Engagement with Taiwan

International messages of congratulations to Lai after the presiden-
tial  election  were  met  with  outcry  from  Beijing. When  President  Fer-
dinand  Marcos  of  the  Philippines  congratulated  Lai  on  his  victory  in
the  2024  presidential  election,  China’s  ambassador  to  the  Philippines
protested, stating that Marcos’ remarks “constitute a serious violation
of the One China principle and . . . a serious breach of the political com-
mitments made by the Philippines to the Chinese side” and suggesting
that Marcos ought to “read more books to properly understand the ins
and  outs  of  the Taiwan  issue,  so  as  to  draw  the  right  conclusions.” 299
Similarly,  when  Singapore’s  foreign  ministry  welcomed  and  congratu-
lated the election, China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs swiftly delivered
démarches to Singapore.300 The Chinese Embassy in Japan also lodged
a protest with Japan’s government after the Japanese Foreign Minister
sent a congratulatory message to Lai.301

645

In response to international support for Taiwan, China engaged in
more blatant attempts to dissuade foreign officials from interacting
with it. For example, China waged an aggressive influence campaign
to deter participation in this year’s Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on
China  (IPAC) *  summit  held  in  Taiwan.  In  the  days  leading  up  to
the July 2024 meeting, reports emerged of some delegates being con-
tacted by Chinese diplomats in what they said was a “clear attempt
to  intimidate  and  dissuade”  them  from  attending.302  The  Guard-
ian  reported  that  Luke  de  Pulford,  executive  director  of  IPAC,  said
some  members  had  received  calls  or  demands  for  meetings  sched-
uled at the same time as the summit to “express to them why they
shouldn’t wade into the Taiwan question,” or they were offered trips
to China “as if they could be bought off.” 303 At the summit, Taiwan
formally  joined  IPAC,  with  representatives  from  the  DPP  and TPP
selected to serve as co-chairs leading Taiwan’s delegation to the alli-
ance.† 304 IPAC members also launched the 2758 Initiative, pledging
to pass resolutions in their respective legislatures to reject Beijing’s
distortion  of  UNGA  2758  as  international  law.305  In  March  2024,
the  U.S.  Department  of  Justice  unsealed  an  indictment  revealing
that in or about 2021, Chinese hackers associated with the Ministry
of  State  Security  targeted  124  politicians  that  are  members  of  the
alliance.306

Taiwan  Deepens  Engagement  with  Unofficial  Partners  in

Asia and Europe

Taiwan  continued  its  efforts  to  find  ways  to  deepen  cooperation
with other like-minded democracies. European nations and political
parties  appeared  to  be  increasingly  receptive  to  Taiwan’s  outreach
and  deepening  economic  relationships  through  trade  agreements
and investments in the continent. In Asia, more countries enhanced
their relationships with Taiwan, much to Beijing’s ire.

Europe Increasingly Receptive to Taipei’s Outreach

Taiwan under DPP administrations has sought to strengthen ties
with  European  countries  by  appealing  to  shared  values  of  democ-
racy and human rights, an effort the Lai Administration is seeking
to  enhance  during  a  moment  of  increased  trade  tensions  between
Europe  and  China.307  Besides  the Vatican,  which  maintains  official
diplomatic ties with Taiwan, every other European country conducts
relations  with Taiwan  through  unofficial  channels,  with  many  stip-
ulating  their  own  versions  of  a “One  China  policy.” 308 The  EU  also
maintains a “One China policy” that recognizes the PRC as the sole
legal  government  of  China  while  maintaining  relations  and  coop-
eration  with  Taiwan  in  a  variety  of  areas.309  Europe  has  a  vested
interested in peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait. An estimated

40  percent  of  the  EU’s  external  trade  passes  through  the  Taiwan
Strait, total trade with Taiwan was $73.8 billion in 2023, and some
30,000 Europeans live in Taiwan.310

In  March  2024,  then  Vice  President-elect  Hsiao  traveled  to  four
European  countries:  Belgium,  the  Czech  Republic,  Lithuania,  and
Poland,  marking  the  first  visit  of  an  incumbent  Taiwan  Vice  Pres-
ident  to  Europe.311  In  Brussels,  Hsiao  met  with  over  30  European
Parliament  members,  advocating  for  the  uptake  of  a  trade  frame-
work  between  Taiwan  and  the  EU  similar  to  the  U.S.-Taiwan  21st
Century  Trade  Agreement.312  In  November  2023,  Taiwan  and  the
UK  signed  an  Enhanced  Trade  Partnership,  the  first  such  deal
in  Europe.313  The  bilateral  framework  came  months  after  the  EU
members  scuttled  an  investment  agreement  between  the  bloc  and
Taiwan  proposed  by  the  Tsai  Administration.314  Notably,  Taiwan
Semiconductor  Manufacturing  Company  (TSMC)  broke  ground  on
an  $11  billion  semiconductor  fab  in  Dresden,  Germany,  in  August
2024  after  about  half  the  funding  was  provided  in  subsidies  by  the
German government.315

Former  Soviet  and  Eastern  Bloc  countries  in  central  and  eastern
Europe  have  been  among  the  most  outspoken  in  their  support  for
Taiwan. Their  shared  experience  resisting  a  threatening  revisionist
power  intent  on  eroding  their  national  identity  has  only  come  into
sharper  relief  since  Russia’s  invasion  of  Ukraine,  opening  an  op-
portunity  for  Taiwan  to  appeal  to  these  countries’  historical  sense
of  self  determination.316  In  2021,  Lithuania  opened  a  “Taiwanese
Representative  Office  in  Lithuania”  using  the  national  nomencla-
ture rather than Beijing-approved “Chinese Taipei,” a decision it has
upheld  despite  coming  under  pressure  from  China.317  Taiwan  has
also  stepped  up  efforts  to  foster  business  ties  with  the  region  with
the  $200  million  state-backed  Central  and  Eastern  Europe  (CEE)
Investment fund.318

Taiwan  Increasingly  Factored  into  Indo-Pacific  Nations’

International Policies

Japan  and  Taiwan  continued  to  deepen  ties,  though  limitations
remain. As  discussed  above,  Japan  congratulated Taiwan  for  a  suc-
cessful  democratic  election  and  Lai  on  his  victory,  to  China’s  dis-
may.319  Lai  hosted  a  delegation  of  70  members  of  Japan’s  Liberal
Democratic  Party’s  Youth  Division  in  August,  stating  that  Taipei
and  Tokyo  have  “a  shared  future.” 320  Taiwan’s  TSMC  opened  a
new  plant  in  Kumamoto,  Japan,  and  Japan  increased  imports  of
Taiwanese  pineapples,  demonstrating  Japan’s  willingness  to  assist
Taiwan  in  withstanding  China’s  economic  coercion.321  The  Japan
Coast  Guard  and  Taiwan’s  CGA  carried  out  a  joint  maritime  ex-
ercise.322  In  July  2024,  a  Taiwan  coast  guard  ship,  Hsun  Hu  No.
9,  engaged  in  a  search,  rescue,  and  communication  drill  with  the
Japan  Coast  Guard’s  Sagami  patrol  vessel  after  making  a  port  call
at Tokyo  for  supplies  of  fuel,  water,  and  food.323 A  Chinese  Foreign
Ministry spokesman protested this event, stating: “We urge Japan to
abide by the ‘one-China’ principle . . . correct its mistakes immediate-
ly,  not  condone  and  support Taiwan  independence  separatist  forces
in  any  form.” 324  Direct  Japanese  cooperation  with Taiwan  remains
limited,  however,  as  the  country  lacks  a  domestic  legal  framework

647

for building closer ties, particularly on defense issues.325 Japan and
Taiwan  maintain  a  regular  maritime  cooperation  dialogue  but  lack
any  kind  of  formal  security  cooperation.326  While  Japan’s  govern-
ment has started describing peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait
as  important  to  its  own  security  interests  in  strategic  documents,
Japanese businesses are wary of economic retaliation should Japan
openly enhance ties during peacetime.327

Indo-Pacific  nations  are  also  increasingly  signaling  support  for
maintaining peace in the Taiwan Strait through defense dialogues
and  training.  In  August  2024,  Australia  and  Canada  released  a
joint  statement  on  strengthening  their  bilateral  defense  rela-
tionship  that  reaffirmed  both  nations’  commitment  to  deterring
conflict  in  the  Indo-Pacific  and  opposing  any  unilateral  changes
to  the  status  quo  in  the  Taiwan  Strait.328  The  joint  statement
of  the  United  States-Japan-South  Korea  Trilateral  Chiefs  of  De-
fense  Meeting  in  June  2024  emphasized  the  importance  of  peace
and  stability  across  the  Taiwan  Strait.329  Likely  in  response  to
the increased aggressive activities of the CCG around the Philip-
pines, Japan, and Taiwan, Japan conducted its first ever trilateral
coast  guard  exercise  with  the  United  States  and  the  Philippines
in  June  2024.330 The  United  States  continues  to  deepen  its  part-
nership  with  the  Philippines  through  joint  training  and  the  up-
grading  of  military  bases  in  the  Philippines,  which  may  prove
vital  in  the  case  of  a  Taiwan  contingency.331  (For  more  on  U.S.

Taiwan Seeks to Diversify Trade

Taiwan’s economy registered strong topline growth in 2024, fueled
by  global  demand  for  its  high-value  technology  exports  as  the  shift
of  outbound  investment  from  Taiwan  away  from  the  Mainland  ac-
celerated. Taiwan’s  dynamic  market  economy  in  2023  ranked  22nd
largest  in  the  world,  with  a  nominal  GDP  of  $753.6  billion,  just
behind  Poland  and  ahead  of  Belgium.332  The  island’s  23.4  million
inhabitants  enjoy  a  high  standard  of  living,  with  per  capita  income
of  $76,900,  when  adjusted  for  purchasing  power  parity,  over  three
times  higher  than  China  ($25,000)  and  nearly  on  par  with  that  of
the United States ($85,400).333 Taiwan achieved rapid economic ad-
vancement  through  pursuit  of  an  export-oriented  growth  strategy,
and today exports still account for about 70 percent of total GDP.334
Taiwan  is  a  top  trading  partner  for  both  China  and  the  United
States  for  important  industries,  including  electronics,  information
technology,  petrochemicals,  textiles,  steel,  cement,  autos,  pharma-
ceuticals,  and  machinery.335  Notably,  Taiwan  fabricates  92  percent
of  the  world’s  most  advanced  semiconductors,  an  industry  thrust
into greater prominence during pandemic-induced supply chain dis-
ruptions  and  continuing  with  the  AI  boom.336  In  recent  years,  the
semiconductor industry has accounted for 13–15 percent of Taiwan’s
total  economic  output.337  Despite  its  prosperity,  Taiwan’s  economy
faces a number of external and internal destabilizing forces, includ-
ing threats from natural disasters, dependency on imported energy,
land and housing constraints, a low birthrate and an aging popula-

648

tion, ongoing economic coercion from China, and the risks of poten-
tial shocks from a breakdown in cross-Strait relations.338

The  stability  of  the  global  economic  system  is  inextricably  linked
to  the  stability  of  Taiwan’s  industries,  particularly  technology.339
Semiconductors are a key input across a variety of sectors, including
automotive, durable household goods, and consumer electronics. Giv-
en Taiwan’s  critical  position  in  semiconductor  supply  chains,  a  dis-
ruption  to  Taiwan’s  output  would  increase  prices  across  the  board.
Staff economists from the U.S. International Trade Commission esti-
mated that, in the event of a major disruption of output in Taiwan,
the cost of logic chips may increase as much as 59 percent for buyers
in the United States.340 The authors stipulate this is a lower bound
estimate—they  suggest  price  increases  would  be  much  higher  after
accounting for U.S. imports of downstream products assembled with
Taiwan chips.* 341 The impact on the global economy from a disrup-
tion to Taiwan’s output would likely dwarf Russia’s 2022 invasion of
Ukraine,  as  recent  projections  from  Bloomberg  Economics  estimate
a  5  percent  drop  in  global  GDP  from  a  blockade  scenario  and  a  10
percent  drop  in  the  event  of  Chinese  invasion,  equivalent  to  a  cost
of $10 trillion.342

Taiwan’s Domestic Economy

Taiwan posted strong topline economic numbers to start 2024, re-
surgent on the back of global demand for advanced chips used for AI
applications.343 The government’s statistical bureau reported a year-
over-year real GDP growth rate of 6.56 percent in Q1 and 5.09 per-
cent in Q2, fueled by 11.4 percent year-over-year export growth.† 344
The Taiwan Stock Exchange (TWSE) has been on an extended bull-
ish  run  since  October  2022;  the  weighted  stock  index  is  up  26.1
percent  in  the  2023  calendar  year  and  24  percent  through  Q3  of
this  year.345  Over  this  period,  Taiwan’s  stock  market  has  outper-
formed most exchanges globally, including U.S. exchanges, where the
S&P 500 grew 24.2 percent in 2023 and is up 20.8 percent through
Q3 2024.346 The market capitalization of Taiwan’s largest company,
TSMC, stood at $805.1 billion (NTD 25.6 trillion) ‡ on September 30,
2024,  over  one-third  of  the  total  value  of  the  997  companies  listed
on the TWSE.347 So far this year, TSMC is responsible for about 70
percent of total market capitalization growth of all companies listed
on the exchange and has reported net revenue of $63.8 billion (NTD
2  trillion)  through  the  first  three  quarters  of  2024,  a  31.9  percent
year-over-year increase.348

Beyond  accelerated  growth  in  the  export  sectors  and  the  equi-
ty  markets,  key  domestic  economic  indicators  remained  steady. The
unemployment  rate  was  3.48  percent  in  August  2024,  and  despite
concern  over  rising  energy  costs,  inflation  as  measured  by  the  con-

which may also cause them to underestimate the price impact. Lin Jones et al., “U.S. Exposure to
the  Taiwanese  Semiconductor  Industry,”  U.S.  International  Trade  Commission,  November  2023,

† It should be noted that a strong base effect is present in the GDP growth figure for Q1, as the
growth rate a year prior was -3.49 percent. For this reason alone, GDP growth for the remaining
quarters  in  2024  is  expected  to  moderate,  with  official  estimates  forecasting  3.94  percent  GDP
growth for the whole of 2024.

sumer price index (CPI) has remained relatively low at just under 2
percent.349 After ticking up interest rates 12.5 basis points in March
2024,  Taiwan’s  central  bank  held  its  benchmark  discount  rate  at
2.00 percent in June.350 Real average wage growth grew in the first
half  of  2024  for  the  first  time  in  three  years.351 The  price  of  hous-
ing  remains  exorbitantly  high,  with  the  average  price  of  a  dwell-
ing in Taipei hovering around 16 times the average annual income,
higher than London (8.6 times), New York (5.9 times), or Vancouver
(13  times).352  Constrained  land,  high  savings  rates,  and  specula-
tion  contributed  to  surging  housing  prices  starting  after  the  2008
global  financial  crisis,  yet  since  2015  the  unaffordability  issue  has
moved out of Taipei to smaller cities around the island.353 However,
some observers believe decreasing overall population * will alleviate
price  pressure  on  housing  in  the  coming  years.354  In  August  2024
consumer confidence reached its highest level since March 2020.355

Trade and Investment

Taiwan  is  a  heavily  trade-dependent  economy.  In  2023,  Taiwan’s
total goods and services trade with the world was $783 billion, with
exports  of  $432  billion  and  imports  of  $352  billion,  resulting  in  an
$81  billion  trade  surplus.356 Through  September  2024,  exports  and
imports  are  each  up  10.2  percent  from  the  same  period  in  2023.357
China  was Taiwan’s  top  trading  partner  in  2023,  accounting  for  al-
most  30  percent  of  trade  (the  Mainland  accounted  for  21.2  percent,
and  Hong  Kong  and  Macau  accounted  for  an  additional  7.4  per-
cent).358 The  United  States  (14.9  percent),  Japan  (9.7  percent),  and
South Korea (6.0 percent) round out Taiwan’s top five trading part-
ners.359  China  was  the  top  export  market  for  Taiwan’s  products  in
2023 (Mainland $95.7 billion; Hong Kong and Macau $56.6 billion),
followed  by  the  United  States  ($76.2  billion)  and  Japan  ($31.4  bil-
lion).360  Exports  to  the  United  States  have  outpaced  exports  to  the
Mainland through the first half of 2024, marking the first time this
has been the case since 2003.361

Under  the  DPP, Taiwan  has  pursued  policies  to  diversify  its  eco-
nomic  and  trade  relationships  in  recognition  of  the  vulnerabilities
of being reliant on China as its top trade partner. In 2016, the Tsai
Administration  established  the  Office  of  Trade  Negotiation  as  an
independent  agency  under  the  Executive  Yuan,  headed  up  by  the
minister  without  portfolio.362  As  part  of  this  drive  to  recalibrate
the  trade  profile,  Taiwan’s  government  has  sought  to  join  existing
multilateral  agreements  like  the  Comprehensive  and  Progressive
Trans-Pacific  Partnership  (CPTPP),  ink  new  bilateral  agreements,
and  promote  its  own  regional  initiatives,  namely  the Tsai Adminis-
tration’s flagship New Southbound Policy (NSP).363

officials  have  identified  an  opportunity  in  2024  to  clear  the  initial
screening  process  for  entry.364  The  United  States  is  not  a  partici-
pant  in  the  CPTPP,  a  comprehensive  agreement  that  includes  rela-
tively high environmental, labor, and investment standards, market
access  provisions  for  both  goods  and  services,  and  a  dispute  set-
tlement  mechanism.365  To  date,  the  UK  has  been  the  only  country
to  join  through  an  accession  process,  bringing  the  trade  bloc  to  a
combined 15 percent of global GDP.366 For Taiwan, CPTPP members
represent 24 percent of its total annual international trade, and the
National  Development  Council  estimates  joining  would  result  in  a
2 percent increase to GDP.367 China applied to join the CPTPP less
than a week before Taiwan in 2021, complicating Taiwan’s efforts to
join  the  agreement.368 Thus  far,  no  member  country  has  dismissed
either China or Taiwan’s prospects of joining, though some analysts
doubt  that  all  CPTPP  countries  would  support  Taiwan’s  accession
given risks of retaliatory action from China.369

The  next  meeting  of  the  CPTPP  Executive  Committee  where
members  will  likely  take  steps  to  consider  both  applications  is  set
to  take  place  in  the  latter  half  of  2024.370  Canada  is  the  rotating
chair for the year and will host the meeting, a situation Taiwan of-
ficials  have  described  as  a “window  of  opportunity”  given  close  ties
and  the  recent  completion  of  a  bilateral  investment  agreement  be-
tween  Ottawa  and  Taipei.371  If  Taiwan’s  application  proceeds,  the
next step would be establishment of an Accession Working Group to
negotiate details of accession before a process requiring unanimous
approval.372

“New Southbound Policy”

A central pillar of Taiwan’s recent efforts to reduce trade reliance
on China has been to establish its own framework for stronger eco-
nomic  and  cultural  ties  with  Indo-Pacific  nations,  a  policy  the  Lai
Administration has signaled intent to continue. Announced in 2016,
the  New  Southbound  Policy  (NSP)  was  a  flagship  element  of  Tsai
Ing-wen’s  foreign  policy  and  economic  diversification  strategy  seek-
ing  to  draw Taiwan  closer  to  18  countries  in  south Asia,  southeast
Asia,  and  Oceania.* 373  Along  with  promoting  closer  economic  and
trade  relationships,  the  NSP  prioritized  cultural  and  people-to-peo-
ple  ties;  resource-sharing  in  medical,  agricultural,  technology,  and
small  and  medium-sized  enterprises;  and  expanded  opportunities
for  official  engagement  on  multilateral  and  bilateral  trade  agree-
ments.374 Aggregate  trade  between Taiwan  and  these  countries  in-
creased  58.9  percent  between  2016  and  2023  from  $95.8  billion  to
$152.2  billion,  outpacing  the  54.2  percent  total  trade  increase  by
Taiwan  over  the  same  period  (see  Figure  4).375 While  campaigning,
President  Lai  indicated  an  intention  to  maintain  the  NSP  in  its
current form and in June 2024 announced an investment agreement
with Thailand to add to similar agreements signed since 2016 with
India, Vietnam, and the Philippines.376

* New  Southbound  Policy  countries  are Australia,  Bangladesh,  Bhutan,  Brunei,  Cambodia,  In-
dia,  Indonesia,  Laos,  Malaysia,  Burma  (Myanmar),  Nepal,  New  Zealand,  Pakistan,  the  Philip-
pines, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and Vietnam.

Taiwan  Business  Community  Shifts  Focus  of  Investment  out

of the Mainland

The  shift  of  outbound  investment  flows  away  from  China  gained
momentum  in  2023  after  years  of  slow  movement  by  the  business
community  to  substantively  diversify  operations,  though  significant
dependency  remains  given  the  cumulative  stock  of  capital  invest-
ment.  Many  of  the  reasons  behind  this  shift  are  consistent  with  a
similar  shift  in  other  advanced  economies,  driven  by  increased  sec-
ular risk from China and concerns about the uncertainty stemming
from  Xi  Jinping’s  economic  and  regulatory  policies.377  Flows  of  ap-
proved outbound FDI from Taiwan globally jumped from $15 billion
in 2022 to $26.6 billion in 2023 thanks to investment by digital and
information technology companies in overseas manufacturing facili-
ties.378 Between 2013 and 2022, annual approved outbound FDI av-
eraged $18.2 billion, with investment into the Mainland accounting
for an average portion of 43.4 percent.379 China’s share of Taiwan’s
annual FDI flows had slowly declined over that decade (from about
65  percent  in  2013  to  about  30  percent  in  2021),  but  2023  could
signal a major acceleration of the trend. Approved outbound invest-
ment from Taiwan into the Mainland dropped off nearly 40 percent
in  2023,  accounting  for  merely  11.4  percent  of  total  approved  out-
bound  FDI  for  the  year.380  By  contrast,  investment  into  the  United

States  and  Europe  surged  791  percent  and  502  percent  year-over-
year,  respectively,  and  together  they  accounted  for  56.7  percent  of
Taiwan’s  total  approved  outbound  FDI  (see  Figure  5).381  A  large
portion  of  these  increases  are  attributable  to  major  investments  by
TSMC  in  semiconductor  production  facilities  in  Arizona  and  Dres-
den,  Germany.382  In April  2024, TSMC  announced  it  would  expand
its planned investment in the United States over 60 percent to $65
billion  after  receiving  a  $6.6  billion  federal  grant  as  part  of  the
CHIPS and Science Act.383

It  is  worth  noting  that  Taiwan’s  total  FDI  stock  in  China  remains
significant,  as  announced  FDI  projects  from  Taiwan-based  companies
into the Mainland totaled $139 billion in the two decades from 2003 to
2023,  compared  to  $64.9  billion  in  the  United  States.384 Taiwan’s  top
businesses,  including  Foxconn, TSMC,  and Acer,  remain  dependent  on
Chinese-based  manufacturing  for  a  significant  portion  of  their  supply
chains.385 This  dependency  remains  a  considerable  source  of  leverage
for  China  over Taiwan,  would  require  years  to  alter,  and  likely  would
be  accompanied  by  high  costs  and  disruptions  to  output.386  Further-
more, the deep cross-Strait business ties complicate Taiwan’s domestic
politics.  For  instance,  in  October  2023,  China’s  Ministry  of  Commerce
(MOFCOM) announced an investigation into Foxconn, owned by Terry
Gou,  who  at  that  time  was  an  independent  candidate  for  president
of Taiwan. The  move  was  largely  seen  as  political  in  nature,  as  Gou’s
candidacy was likely to pull votes away from China’s preferred candi-
date.387 Lastly, as of 2022 there were 177,000 Taiwan citizens working
in  mainland  China,  a  point  of  growing  concern  given  the  recent  in-
crease of detentions and arrests of Taiwan citizens by Chinese authori-
ties under expanding national security and anti-espionage laws.388

Heavy  Reliance  on  Fuel  Imported  by  Sea  Persists  despite

Effort to Reconfigure Energy Grid

With  scant  natural  energy  resources  of  its  own  and  a  decision
to  largely  abandon  nuclear  energy, Taiwan  is  heavily  dependent  on
energy imports. Such import dependence makes Taiwan particularly
vulnerable  to  a  blockade.  In  2023,  crude  oil  and  petroleum  made
up  the  largest  portion  of  Taiwan’s  total  energy  mix  (44.0  percent),
followed  by  coal  (28.8  percent),  natural  gas  (20.3  percent),  nuclear
(3.9 percent), and renewables (3.0 percent).389 Imported energy com-
prised 96.7 percent of Taiwan’s annual energy supply.* 390

Nuclear  power  has  become  a  point  of  contention  in  the  island’s
domestic  politics  and  a  key  consideration  for  assessing  Taiwan’s
preparedness  to  withstand  an  external  energy  shock.391  Construc-
tion  on  three  nuclear  power  plants  began  in  the  1970s,  and  their
combined  power  generation  provided  nearly  50  percent  of  total
electricity  production  by  the  mid-1980s.392  However,  in  the  wake
of the Fukushima nuclear incident in 2011, concerns grew over the
risk  of  reactors  on  an  earthquake-prone  island,  leading  the  DPP  to
announce  plans  to  phase  out  nuclear  power  completely.393  In  July
2024,  one  of  two  units  at  the  last  operational  nuclear  plant  on  the
island  was  decommissioned,  with  the  second  unit  slated  to  shutter
in  May  2025.394  Though  a  majority  of  citizens  still  support  the  re-
duction  of  nuclear  reactors,  a  slew  of  high-profile  power  outages  in
recent years has increased concern over the grid’s ability to effective-
ly manage demand.395 Furthermore, increased industrial production
in the semiconductor and manufacturing sectors has steadily raised
demand for electricity and resulted in surging energy rates.396 Thus
far,  broader  prices  have  been  largely  unaffected  by  energy  costs  as
Taiwan’s  government  has  provided  heavy  subsidies  to  offset  sus-
tained losses of the state power company, though recently prices for
industrial consumers have begun to increase.397

Starting  in  2016,  the  DPP  sought  to  accelerate  the  adoption  of
clean energy † and improve the power system’s resilience by setting
ambitious  targets  for  an  electricity  generation  mix  of  50  percent
natural gas, 30 percent coal, and 20 percent renewables by 2025.398
The  amount  of  clean  energy  Taiwan  uses  to  generate  electricity
stood at 16.1 percent in 2022, half that of the average for the whole
of  Asia  and  well  behind  China’s  34.9  percent.399  Though  the  Tsai
Administration  made  strides  toward  increasing  renewable  energy
capacity  and  building  out  liquified  natural  gas  (LNG)  facilities  and
infrastructure, in 2023, natural gas-fired plants generated 39.5 per-
cent  of  the  island’s  power,  coal-fired  42.2  percent,  and  renewables
9.5  percent—leading  to  a  reduction  of  the  2025  renewable  energy
target downward to 15 percent.400

Beyond  concerns  over  how  energy  constraints  may  raise  prices
or  fail  to  meet  peak  demand  during  peacetime,  the  proposal  to  in-
corporate  more  clean  energy  and  natural  gas  has  implications  for
China’s ability to disrupt power during a military operation against
the  island.  The  government’s  current  stockpile  requirements  man-

date that oil operators and importers maintain a 60-day supply—on
top of a national 30-day strategic reserve—and eight days of natural
gas.401  Given  that  natural  gas  generates  nearly  40  percent  of  elec-
tricity and is set to increase to 50 percent, major disruptions would
occur  from  a  one-  to  two-week  blockade  once  the  stockpile  was  de-
pleted.* 402 Currently there are two operational LNG terminals, the
largest  in  the  southern  city  Kaohsiung  and  another  in  Taichung,
from which gas is piped to major cities along the western coast and
in  the  north.403  Three  new  LNG  receiving  terminals  are  planned,
as  well  as  expansion  of  the  existing  facilities.404  Resupplying  LNG
would be difficult to impossible under a maritime blockade enforced
by China.405

Cross-Strait Economic and Trade Relations

Economic  and  trade  relations  between  the  PRC  and  the  govern-
ment of Taiwan have steadily deteriorated since President Tsai Ing-
wen  was  first  elected  in  2016,  a  signal  of  Beijing’s  willingness  to
use  economic  levers  to  signal  displeasure  with  the  ruling  DPP  and
attempt to coerce Taiwan into submission.

Economic Coercion Enters a New Phase Post-Election

Along  with  stepping  up  its  rhetoric  and  military  exercises  in  the
immediate aftermath of Lai’s inauguration on May 20, 2024, Beijing
announced on May 29 that it would impose punitive trade measures
on 134 export products from Taiwan.406 This is the latest move in a
concerted  pressure  campaign  carried  out  by  MOFCOM  to  weapon-
ize cross-Strait trade. In 2021, China banned imports of pineapples
from  Taiwan  and  a  handful  of  other  food  products,  citing  sanitary
and phytosanitary issues.407 However, there was a clear correlation
between  the  southern  rural  districts  that  produce  the  majority  of
products  subject  to  bans  and  the  historically  high  levels  of  support
for the DPP in these districts.408 Over the course of 2022 and 2023,
China  continued  to  ban  imports  that  accounted  for  a  small  portion
of cross-Strait trade but for which producers relied on the mainland
market;  the  bans  were  often  timed  around  political  events  Beijing
took issue with, like then Speaker of the U.S. House of Representa-
tives Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taipei in August 2022.409

China  laid  the  groundwork  for  the  recent  bans  with  a  sprawling
trade probe launched last year at the onset of Taiwan’s campaign cy-
cle that intended to threaten rollback of preferential trade arrange-
ments  contingent  upon  the  outcome  of  the  election.  In  April  2023,
one  week  after  then  President  Tsai  met  with  then  Speaker  of  the
U.S.  House  of  Representatives  Kevin  McCarthy  and  one  day  after
Lai Ching-te announced his candidacy, MOFCOM announced it was
launching  a  unilateral  investigation  into  nearly  2,500  products  it
alleged  Taiwan  subjected  to  unfair  restrictions,  including  agricul-
tural,  plastic,  metal,  and  chemical  products.410  The  investigation
was  set  to  expire  one  day  before  Taiwan’s  election  and  carried  the
implicit threat of revoking in part or completely the Economic Coop-

* Taiwan  is  expected  to  have  20  days  of  LNG  storage  capacity  by  2025.  However,  total  storage
capacity  of  LNG  is  limited  by  atmospheric  evaporation  called “boiling  off”  that  afflicts  this  fuel
when  stored  in  large  quantities.  S&P  Global,  “Taiwan  Vulnerable  to  LNG  Supply  Risks  in  the

eration  Framework Agreement  (ECFA)  between  China  and Taiwan
that reduced tariffs on a broad swath of cross-Strait trade since its
enactment  in  2010.* 411  Taiwan’s  premier  denied  the  allegations  of
unfair trade barriers, saying the investigation  was clearly intended
to influence voters and did not adhere to dispute resolution channels
under  the  WTO,  of  which  both  sides  are  members.412  Less  than  a
month  before  the  election,  China  suspended  preferential  tariffs  on
12 petrochemical products under the ECFA.413 After the election, as
noted  above,  China  expanded  suspensions  of  preferential  tariffs  to
the  134  export  products  previously  mentioned,  including  chemical
products,  textiles,  metals,  rubbers  and  plastics,  and  machinery,  for
which  China  comprises  16–35  percent  of  Taiwan’s  exports.414  Con-
firming  the  political  nature  of  its  trade  actions,  on  April  28,  2024,
MOFCOM announced it would lift the ban on some Taiwan fruit and
seafood  products  after  KMT  legislative  caucus  leader  Fu  Kun-chi
visited the Mainland and expressed support for Beijing’s interpreta-
tion of the 1992 Consensus.415

China  Continues  Efforts  to  Acquire  Taiwan’s  Technology,

Talent, and Knowhow

In recent years, Chinese companies and the government have in-
creasingly  carried  out  licit  and  illicit  efforts  to  obtain  trade  secrets
from  Taiwan’s  leading  firms  in  industries  of  strategic  importance.
No  economy  is  more  integrated  in  global  semiconductor  supply
chains  than  Taiwan’s,  with  its  national  champion  TSMC  responsi-
ble  for  producing  leading-edge  logic  chips,  including  those  designed
by  NVIDIA  for  AI  training  and  the  3nm  chips  that  power  Apple
smartphones.416 In February, Taiwan’s representative in the United
States Alexander Yui  said  of  China’s  chip  makers  that  they “cheat”
and “steal” technology.417

National  security  laws  on  the  island  were  tightened  in  2022  to
prohibit  Chinese  investment  in  certain  parts  of  the  industry  and
the  transfer  of  trade  secrets,  making  it  difficult  for  Chinese  chip
companies to legally operate in Taiwan.418 That same year, Taiwan’s
Investigation  Bureau  opened  around  100  probes  into  Chinese  com-
panies  suspected  of  illegally  poaching  Taiwan  technology  talent.419
Chinese  competitors  often  look  to  poach  workers  from  Taiwan  by
offering salaries two to three times higher in some cases.420 In April
2024,  four  Taiwan  nationals  were  convicted  of  poaching  on  behalf
of  Chinese  tech  companies,  and  in  May  authorities  named  eight
companies  accused  of  conducting  illegal  operations  in  Taiwan  and
poaching  talent,  including  Chinese  Apple  supplier  Luxshare  Preci-
sion Industry and Zhejiang Dahua Technology, a company currently
on the U.S. Entity List.421

Taiwan’s  coveted  engineering  workforce  would  become  an  even
more  significant  strategic  asset  in  the  event  of  a  Chinese  invasion.
If  invasion  appears  imminent,  Benjamin  Noon  of  the  Vandenberg
Coalition and Allison Schwartz, formerly of the American Enterprise
Institute,  have  advocated  for  evacuating  Taiwan’s  semiconductor
engineers  in  an  effort  akin  to  the  allied  Operation  Paperclip  that

brought German scientists to the United States in the twilight days
of  World  War  II.422  This  proposal  would  seek  to  relocate  them  at
foundries  in  the  United  States  and  allied  nations  to  ramp  up  pro-
duction  and  curb  the  ensuing  supply  shock.423  As  discussed  previ-
ously,  staff  from  the  U.S.  International Trade  Commission  released
a  working  paper  in  November  2023  that  projected  a  58.6  percent
average  price  increase  for  logic  chips  in  the  U.S.  market  in  the  hy-
pothetical  event  of  a  major  disruption  to  Taiwan’s  semiconductor
output, noting this may be a conservative estimate.424

The  continued  operation  of  Taiwan’s  chip  fabs  would  be  subject
to  other  constraints  beyond  staffing  during  a  blockade.  The  deeply
integrated  supply  chains  for  semiconductor  fabrication  inputs  such
as  chemicals,  silicon,  and  photomasks  are  mainly  supplied  by  the
United  States  and  its  allies  and,  if  cut  off,  would  inhibit  utilization
of  the  facilities.425 TSMC  Chair  Mark  Liu  has  stated  that  it  would
be  impossible  to  take  TSMC  by  force  because  operations  depend
on  “real-time  connection  with  the  outside  world  [for]  materials  to
chemicals  to  spare  parts  to  engineering  software  and  diagnosis.” 426
Chemicals, gases, and other raw materials used in fabs are sourced
from  a  few  suppliers  and  spoil  in  a  matter  of  months,  which  would
render  the  facilities  inoperable  after  existing  supplies  run  out.427
Furthermore, the Dutch company ASML reportedly claimed in May
2024 that in the event of  a Chinese invasion they maintain the  ca-
pability  to  remotely  disable  their  $217  million  extreme  ultraviolet
machines used to etch silicon wafers in TSMC’s fabs.428

U.S.-Taiwan Economic and Trade Relations

Taiwan  is  a  key  trade  partner  of  the  United  States,  and  over  the
past year efforts to enhance ties by both Taipei and Washington have
resulted  in  substantial  investment  announcements  and  continued
progress  on  substantive  agreements  like  the  U.S.-Taiwan  Initiative
on  21st  Century  Trade.  According  to  the  U.S.  Bureau  of  Economic
Analysis  data,  Taiwan  ranked  13th  among  U.S.  trade  partners  on
the basis of total two-way trade in goods and services in 2023 ($152
billion),  behind  France  and  ahead  of  Singapore.429  Looking  at  only
goods  trade  in  2023,  Taiwan  was  the  United  States’  seventh-larg-
est merchandise trading partner ($128 billion), tenth-largest export
market ($40 billion), and eighth-largest source for imports ($88 bil-
lion).430

Trade Negotiations Progress

Negotiations for the U.S.-Taiwan Initiative on 21st Century Trade
remain  ongoing.431 The  initiative  was  announced  in  June  2022  and
seeks  to  reach  commitments  and  “economically  meaningful  out-
comes”  in  11  areas  as  part  of  its  negotiating  mandate,  according  to
the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative.432 A first agreement was
signed  on  June  1,  2023—exactly  one  year  after  the  initiative  was
announced—and covered four of the 11 issue areas: customs admin-
istration and trade facilitation, regulatory practices, anticorruption,
and small and medium-sized enterprises.433 These issue areas were
seen as the less complex areas where interests and existing regula-
tions between the two parties were already in relative alignment.434

657

In  April  2024,  negotiators  convened  an  in-person  round  of  talks
on  issues  pertaining  to  agriculture,  environment,  and  labor  as  part
of efforts to reach a second-stage agreement on the next three man-
date areas.435 If this stage of negotiations concludes successfully, the
remaining  mandate  areas  of  digital  trade,  standards,  state-owned
enterprises, and non-market policies and practices will be addressed
in a final stage.436

To date, these negotiations do not include traditional “market ac-
cess” issues (e.g., tariffs, services market access) or investment pro-
tections. Additionally, it is not clear if the broader U.S. suspension of
digital  trade  negotiations  in  the  Indo-Pacific  Economic  Framework
for Prosperity (IPEF) following withdrawal of U.S. support for stan-
dards  at  the WTO  will  apply  to  the  digital  chapter  in  these  negoti-
ations.437

Implications for the United States

Taiwan  remains  a  potential  flashpoint  for  conflict  with  China.
China’s  leadership  has  expressed  its  intention  to  bring  the  island
under  its  control  and  has  not  deviated  from  its  goal  of  unification.
Beijing  has  made  it  clear  that  it  is  willing  to  use  a  wide  variety  of
methods  to  achieve  this  goal,  from  information  operations  to  shape
Taiwan’s public opinion to the use of force. While Lai’s election raises
concerns in Beijing, the DPP’s position as a minority government is
likely to be interpreted by Chinese leadership as a sign of weakness
and potential opportunity to further its agenda through engagement
with  the  opposition. This  interpretation  will  likely  result  in  Beijing
intensifying  its  pressure  campaign  on  the  DPP,  raising  the  risk  for
miscalculation between not only China and Taiwan but possibly also
China and the United States.

While  the  Lai  Administration  is  clear  in  its  intent  to  adopt  an
asymmetric  defense  strategy,  China’s  pressure  campaign  presents
challenges  to  the  adoption  of  that  strategy,  as  Taiwan  will  have  to
make  complex  decisions  about  resource  allocation  between  counter-
ing  China’s  gray  zone  activities  or  following  through  on  adopting
equipment more appropriate for countering an invasion. The United
States  can  assist  Taiwan  in  both  countering  China’s  gray  zone  ef-
forts and in providing materiel for its asymmetric strategy, but chal-
lenges exist in the rapid armament of Taiwan. U.S. defense industri-
al  base  manufacturing  limitations  and  extended  delivery  timelines
mean  that  at  the  current  rate, Taiwan  is  unlikely  to  be  armed  to  a
degree sufficient to deter or counter China from invading on its own,
and so it will rely on the United States to provide for its deterrence
as  the  PLA  continues  to  approach  its  2027  and  mid-century  mod-
ernization  goals.  Even  if  it  can  be  deterred  from  outright  invasion,
China  continues  to  build  the  capability  to  quarantine  or  blockade
the island, which represents a unique challenge for U.S. and Taiwan
leaders.

Cross-Strait  economic  relations  have  significantly  deteriorated
given  Beijing’s  increased  intimidation  and  economic  coercion  activ-
ities.  Though  China  remains  Taiwan’s  top  trading  partner,  exports
to  the  United  States  have  surged  since  late  2023,  driven  in  large
part  by  demand  for  advanced  integrated  circuits  used  for  AI  and
advanced computing. This coincides with substantial investment by

658

TSMC in production facilities outside of Taiwan, including construc-
tion of three semiconductor foundries in Arizona capable of produc-
ing  cutting-edge  logic  chips.  In  the  meantime,  Taiwan  remains  by
far  the  most  dominant  in  production  of  advanced  semiconductors,
and any disruption to output on the island will have major ramifica-
tions  for  the  global  economy  and—more  importantly—U.S.  national
and economic security.

659

Appendix  I:  Beijing’s  “One  China  Principle”  and
the  U.S.  “One  China  Policy”

Though Beijing attempts to conflate the issue of “One China,” Bei-
jing’s  “One  China  principle”  and  the  U.S.  “One  China  policy”  are
very  different.  Beijing’s  One  China  principle  claims  that  Taiwan  is
an inalienable part of the People’s Republic of China (PRC). In con-
trast,  the  U.S.  One  China  policy  does  not  take  an  official  stance
on  the  PRC’s  claim  to  sovereignty  over Taiwan.  Rather,  the  United
States  only “acknowledges”  Beijing’s  position “that  there  is  but  one
China and Taiwan is part of China.” 438

Beijing’s “One China Principle”

Beijing’s One China principle insists that “there is only one China
in  the  world,  Taiwan  is  part  of  China,  and  the  government  of  the
PRC  is  the  sole  legal  government  representing  the  whole  of  Chi-
na.” 439 According  to  a  Chinese  government  white  paper  on Taiwan
published in February 2000, Beijing developed the One China prin-
ciple after the 1949 founding of the PRC in order to establish diplo-
matic relations with other countries while safeguarding its national
sovereignty  and  territorial  integrity.440  Nevertheless,  prior  to  1949,
CCP leaders had sometimes expressed explicit support for Taiwan’s
independence.  In  1936,  Mao  Zedong,  who  had  recently  consolidat-
ed  his  position  as  the  dominant  figure  in  the  CCP,  told  American
journalist  Edgar  Snow  that  the  CCP  would  support  Taiwan  in  its
“struggle  for  independence”  from  Japanese  imperialism.* 441  While
CCP authorities have consistently claimed sovereignty over Taiwan
since  1949,  the  specific  term “One  China  principle”  was  not  widely
used until the 1970s, and the phrase only became a mainstay of of-
ficial Chinese government rhetoric in the 1990s and early 2000s.† 442
The PRC’s first white paper on Taiwan in 1993 only mentioned the
“principle of one China” in passing on four occasions.443 In contrast,
China’s  2000  white  paper  on  Taiwan  was  titled  “The  One  China
Principle  and  the Taiwan  Issue”  and  uses  the  term  on  41  separate
occasions.444  Since  the  early  2000s,  the  “One  China  principle”  has
been ubiquitous in Chinese propaganda about Taiwan, and Chinese
officials  often  repeat  the  false  claim  that  all  countries  with  which
it  has  established  diplomatic  relations  accept  the “One  China  prin-
ciple.” 445

Beijing’s Use of “Reunification”

In  Chinese  propaganda,  the  “One  China  principle”  is  closely  as-
sociated  with  Beijing’s  stated  goal  of  achieving “reunification”  with
Taiwan.446  Beijing  uses  the  term “reunification”  to  refer  to  the  pro-

* These  interviews  were  published  in  Edgar  Snow’s  1937  book,  Red  Star  Over  China.  Chinese
translations  of  Red  Star  Over  China  continued  to  include  Mao’s  quote  supporting Taiwan  inde-
pendence  until  at  least  1979.  More  recent  Chinese  editions  of  the  book,  however,  have  censored
Mao’s  comment  on  Taiwan.  Edgar  Snow,  Red  Star  Over  China  (New  York:  Grove  Press,  1994),

until March 1971. People’s Daily, “The Japanese Reactionary Faction’s Ambition to Plot to Re-Oc-
cupy  China’s  Taiwan  Province  Is  Exposed”  (日本反动派阴谋重新霸占我台湾省的野心毕露),  March

cess  of  absorbing Taiwan  as  an  inalienable  part  of  the  state  called
“China”  and  to  imply  that  cross-Strait  relations  are  “purely  an  in-
ternal matter for China.” 447 In contrast, Taiwan, the United States,
and  some  international  observers  generally  avoid  the  term  “reuni-
fication”  because Taiwan  has  never  been  governed  by  the  PRC.* 448
This  report  uses  the  term  “reunification”  only  when  quoting  CCP
sources  and  sources  that  conform  to  CCP  preferences.  The  choice
to  use  “unification”  or  “reunification”  is  primarily  an  issue  for  En-
glish-language  sources,  as  both  words  are  used  to  translate  the
same  Chinese-language  term,  tongyi  (“to  unite  as  one”).  Neverthe-
less,  the  CCP  has  not  always  used  the  English  term “reunification”
to  describe  its  ambition  to  rule  Taiwan.  After  1949,  Beijing  vowed
to “liberate” Taiwan  from  Chiang  Kai-shek  and  the  Kuomintang  by
military means before adopting the term “peaceful liberation” in the
mid-1950s in a reexamination of its policies and an attempt to sway
Chiang’s government toward a negotiated political settlement.449 It
was  not  until  the  1970s  that  the  CCP  consistently  replaced  “liber-
ation”  with  “reunification.” 450  Deng  Xiaoping  made  this  change  in
terminology  official  during  his  visit  to  the  United  States  in  1979,
speaking  of  “reunifying  the  motherland”  and  telling  U.S.  senators
that  China “no  longer  use[s]  the  term ‘liberation  of Taiwan.’ ” 451  Xi
Jinping  and  CCP  leaders  now  refer  to  the  “complete  reunification”
of  China—by  which  they  mean  imposing  PRC  sovereignty  over
Taiwan—as  “indispensable  for  the  realization  of  China’s  rejuvena-
tion.” 452  China’s  2022  white  paper  on Taiwan  uses  the  term  tongyi
(translated in English as reunification) no fewer than 124 times.453

The U.S. “One China Policy”

Despite  Beijing’s  false  claim  that  China  and  the  United  States
established  diplomatic  relations  “on  the  basis  of  the  One  China
principle,”  the  U.S.  One  China  policy  does  not  take  a  position  on
sovereignty  over  Taiwan.  As  articulated  by  the  U.S.  Department  of
State  Bureau  of  East Asian  and  Pacific Affairs: “The  United  States
has  a  longstanding  one  China  policy,  which  is  guided  by  the  Tai-
wan  Relations  Act,  the  three  U.S.-China  Joint  Communiques,  and
the Six Assurances.” † 454 Significantly, in the 1978 U.S.-China Joint
Communique,  which  established  diplomatic  relations  between  the
United  States  and  the  PRC,  the  United  States  reaffirmed  it  only
“acknowledges”  (but  does  not  endorse)  “the  Chinese  position  that

* English-language  statements  published  by Taiwan’s  government,  including  the  Mainland Af-
fairs  Council  and  Ministry  of  Foreign  Affairs,  generally  refer  to  China’s  pursuit  of  “unification”
with Taiwan. The U.S. government generally does not use either “unification” or “reunification” in
official  statements  pertaining  to  cross-Strait  relations,  which  instead  refer  to  the  United  States’
opposition  to  “any  unilateral  changes  to  the  status  quo  from  either  side.”  Major  international
newspapers,  including  the  New  York  Times  and  Washington  Post,  also  generally  use  the  term
unification. Taiwan’s Mainland Affairs Council, MAC 2024 First Quarter Report on the Situation
in Mainland China, May 6, 2024; Taiwan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, MOFA Response to False
Claims  Made  in  Joint  Communiqué  between  PRC  and  Russia  Regarding Taiwan,  December  22,
2023; U.S. Department of State Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs, U.S. Relations with Tai-
wan: Bilateral Relations Fact Sheet, May 28, 2022; Chris Buckley and Christ Horton, “Xi Jinping
Warns  Taiwan  That  Unification  Is  the  Goal  and  Force  Is  an  Option,”  New  York  Times,  January
1, 2019; Adela Suliman, “China’s Xi vows peaceful ‘unification’ with Taiwan Days after Sending a
Surge of Warplanes near the Island,” Washington Post, October 9, 2021.

† A  detailed  explanation  of  the Taiwan  Relations Act  (1979), Three  Joint  Communiques  (1972,
1978,  1982),  and  the  Six Assurances  (1982)  can  be  found  in  the  Commission’s  2019 Annual  Re-
port.  U.S.-China  Economic  and  Security  Review  Commission,  2019  Annual  Report  to  Congress,

there is but one China and Taiwan is part of China.” * 455 Beijing has
obfuscated  this  distinction  through  deliberate  mistranslation.  The
Chinese text of the 1978 Communique translates “acknowledges” as
chengren (“to recognize”), a term that in Chinese clearly implies U.S.
agreement with China’s position.456 In contrast, the Chinese text of
the 1972 Joint Communique, which first articulated each respective
government’s position on Taiwan, had translated “acknowledges” as
renshi  (“to  be  aware  of”),  a  term  that  more  faithfully  conveys  the
meaning of the English text.457

According to its One China policy, the United States:
 • “Oppose[s] any unilateral changes to the status quo from either

side”;

 • “[Does] not support Taiwan independence”;
 • “Expect[s]  cross-Strait  differences  to  be  resolved  by  peaceful

means”; and

 • “Continue[s]  to  have  an  abiding  interest  in  peace  and  stability

across the Taiwan Strait.” 458

In  line  with  the  Taiwan  Relations  Act  (1979),  the  United  States
also makes available defense articles and services to Taiwan “as nec-
essary  to  enable Taiwan  to  maintain  a  sufficient  self-defense  capa-
bility”  and  maintains  its  own  ability  to  resist  any  use  of  “force  or
other  forms  of  coercion  that  would  jeopardize  the  security,  or  the
social and economic system, of Taiwan.” 459

* In the 1972 Joint Communique, the “U.S. side declared [that] the United States acknowledges
that  all  Chinese  on  either  side  of  the  Taiwan  Strait  maintain  there  is  but  one  China  and  that
Taiwan  is  a  part  of  China.  The  United  States  Government  does  not  challenge  that  position.  It
reaffirms its interest in a peaceful settlement of the Taiwan question by the Chinese themselves.”

CHAPTER 10: HONG KONG

Abstract

Under  the  influence  of  China’s  central  government,  Hong  Kong
has  installed  General  Secretary  of  the  Chinese  Communist  Party
(CCP)  Xi  Jinping’s  view  of  “holistic”  national  security,  weakening
the  city’s  once  vibrant  institutions,  civil  society,  and  business  envi-
ronment.  Hong  Kong  has  experienced  a  serious  erosion  in  its  au-
tonomy  from  the  Mainland,  although  the  manifestation  of  this  ero-
sion  to  date  has  been  far  more  prominent  in  civil  rights  compared
with  the  business  environment.  Hong  Kong’s  new  national  security
legislation,  often  called  the  Article  23  Ordinance,  introduces  new
and  ambiguous  offenses  that  target  all  remnants  of  resistance  to
Beijing’s  control  over  the  city’s  political,  religious,  and  civil  society
organizations.  The  continued  implementation  of  the  mainland  Na-
tional  Security  Law  (NSL)  and  the  imposition  of  the Article  23  Or-
dinance, which has already been invoked to make new arrests, have
diminished  the  former  distinctiveness  of  Hong  Kong.  The  vaguely
defined offenses in both national security laws create an atmosphere
of fear and uncertainty, intended to coerce Hong Kongers to self-cen-
sor  or  face  legal  repercussions.  Beijing’s  heavy-handed  control  over
the  city  has  led  many  Hong  Kongers,  including  activists,  families,
and  business  professionals,  to  leave.  Consequently,  Hong  Kong’s
status  as  an  international  business  hub  has  deteriorated,  and  its
economy  has  lost  significant  ground  since  the  passage  of  the  NSL
in 2020. The seven million residents of Hong Kong continue to enjoy
greater  freedoms  than  those  living  on  the  Mainland—including  a
freely  convertible  currency  and  comparatively  uncensored  internet
and media—but only so far as they refrain from violating the CCP’s
broad and opaque conceptions of political dissent. Although notable
pockets  of  society,  including  the  business  community,  remain  san-
guine  about  Hong  Kong’s  status  as  a  regional  financial  and  trade
hub, that status was based on a set of freedoms and the rule of law,
which Beijing is actively eroding.

Key Findings

 • Imposition  of  the  Article  23  Ordinance  further  equips  Hong
Kong’s  government  with  legal  tools  to  oppress  any  vestiges  of
dissent. Hong Kong’s robust civil society, which once set it apart
from the Mainland, is being eroded and replaced with a society
where  individuals,  religious  organizations,  and  the  press  must
censor  themselves  or  face  possible  criminal  prosecution  for  ac-
tivities that were previously protected by law.

 • The  rule  of  law  in  Hong  Kong  is  under  threat.  Hong  Kong’s
courts no longer maintain clear independence from the govern-
ment  and  are  being  weaponized  as  the Article  23  Ordinance  is

(686)

687

enforced. The  court’s  verdict  in  more  than  a  dozen  of  the  Hong
Kong  47  cases  to  convict  pro-democracy  advocates  for  offens-
es  that  allegedly  threatened  national  security,  and  subsequent
resignations  by  international  jurists  in  protest,  illustrate  the
degradation of the city’s judicial integrity.

 • Imposition  of  the  Article  23  Ordinance  introduces  uncertainty
for businesses in Hong Kong. Firms and business professionals
could potentially face criminal conviction for conducting normal
business  activity,  including  research,  international  collabora-
tion, and due diligence.

 • Hong Kong’s repressive new security regime not only threatens
Hong  Kong  residents  but  also  can  endanger  foreign  business
professionals  in  Hong  Kong  and  be  wielded  as  a  cudgel  to  re-
press  the  overseas  activist  community,  including  in  the  United
States, through its extraterritorial application.

 • Chinese nationals and businesses have flooded Hong Kong’s la-
bor  force  and  economy,  advancing  Beijing’s  ambitions  to  inte-
grate Hong Kong along with Macau and nine nearby mainland
Chinese cities into the Greater Bay Area (GBA) economic hub.
 • Hong  Kong  has  become  a  key  transshipment  node  in  a  global
network  that  assists  Russia  and  other  adversaries  in  evading
sanctions  and  circumventing  export  controls.  This  diminishes
the  efficacy  of  U.S.  and  allied  government  efforts  to  advance
important  national  security  interests,  and  it  exposes  Western
investors,  financial  institutions,  and  firms  to  financial  and  rep-
utational risks when they do business in Hong Kong.

Recommendations
The Commission recommends:

 • Congress  require  the  Administration  to  produce  a  determina-
tion  whether  reasonable  grounds  exist  for  concluding  that  the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region should be designated
as  a  Primary  Money  Laundering  Concern  (PMLC)  jurisdiction
under  Section  311  of  the  Patriot Act  due  to  its  growing  role  as
the central sanctions evasion hub and transshipment center for
illicit finance and technology to Russia, Iran, and North Korea.
 • Congress  direct  the  U.S.  Department  of  the  Treasury,  in  coor-
dination  with  the  U.S.  Departments  of  State  and  Commerce,
to  provide  the  relevant  congressional  committees  a  report  as-

Introduction

The people of Hong Kong experienced another dire year under the
control of China’s central government. What was once a thriving civ-
il  society  with  independent  institutions  and  an  international  busi-
ness  hub  continues  its  transformation  into  another  mainland-style
city.  Beijing  continues  to  accelerate  its  takeover  of  the  city.  Despite
promising Hong Kong a “high degree of autonomy” in the Sino-Brit-
ish  Joint  Declaration  through  2047,  under  General  Secretary  Xi’s
leadership Beijing has accelerated its erosion of that commitment.1
China has betrayed its promise of “one country, two systems” by roll-
ing  back  longstanding  policies,  basic  freedoms,  and  privileges  that
made  the  city  distinct  from  the  Mainland.2 Through  the  imposition
of  the  Article  23  Ordinance,  officially  titled  the  Safeguarding  Na-
tional Security Ordinance,* the Hong Kong government has sent an-
other clear warning signal to activists in Hong Kong and dissidents
outside  of  the  city  that  any  behavior  it  deems  a  threat  to  national
security  is  a  violation  of  criminal  law.  Along  with  the  2020  NSL
passed by China’s central government, the Article 23 Ordinance has
again moved the red lines on what the government will permit, and
it  has  expanded  the  definitions  of  criminal  offenses  in  ways  that
pose  an  extraterritorial  threat.  Hong  Kong’s  legal  system  provides
increasingly fewer protections for civil liberties—like freedoms of ex-
pression, assembly, and religion—that were once the bedrock of the
city  and  distinguished  it  from  the  Mainland. The  intervention  into
Hong Kong’s elections, judiciary, and education systems and attacks
on  its  civil  society  illustrate  the  lengths  to  which  Beijing  will  go  to
tighten its control over the city.

Hong Kong’s businesses also face a vague and contradictory legal
environment  under  the  Article  23  Ordinance,  which  may  severely
inhibit  the  ability  of  firms  to  conduct  normal  business  operations,
including pursuing needed research and due diligence. At the same
time, Hong Kong’s broader economy faces headwinds, including slow
economic  growth  and  a  sluggish  market,  while  a  steady  flight  of
multinational  firms  scale  back  their  operations  or  leave  the  city
altogether.  In  their  place,  Hong  Kong  government  initiatives  en-
couraged  by  the  Mainland  have  infused  Hong  Kong  with  an  influx
of  mainland  businesses  and  workers  and  enhanced  links  between

* The  Safeguarding  National  Security  Ordinance  is  the  fulfillment  of  requirements  under
Article  23  of  Hong  Kong’s  Basic  Law,  essentially  its  mini  constitution.  In  the  vernacular,  the
Article  23  Ordinance  is  sometimes  just  referred  to  as  Article  23,  which  was  the  provision  of
the  Basic  Law  that  required  Hong  Kong  to  pass  national  security  rules.  Ricardo  Barrios, “Hong

Hong  Kong  and  the  surrounding  Greater  Bay  Area  (GBA).*  Hong
Kong’s dwindling international status is also reflected in its slipping
role as a shipping hub, which continues to decline compared to peer
Asian neighbors and increasingly serves Beijing’s goals in sanctions
evasion.  This  chapter  details  Hong  Kong’s  recent  political  and  eco-
nomic  developments,  attacks  on  its  rule  of  law  and  basic  freedoms,
and  the  implications  for  the  United  States.  It  is  based  on  consulta-

Hong  Kong’s  Safeguarding  National  Security

Ordinance  (Article  23  Ordinance)

Overview of the Article 23 Ordinance

Hong  Kong’s  Article  23  legislation  went  into  effect  on  March  23,
2024,  and  introduced  severe  measures  that  will  further  target  dis-
sidents,  undermine  civil  liberties,  and  minimize  Hong  Kong’s  dis-
tinctiveness from the Mainland.3 While already eroded by the 2020
NSL, the vestiges of Hong Kong’s independent institutions and open
business environment deteriorate even further under the Article 23
Ordinance.4 The Article  23  Ordinance  also  threatens  to  further  re-
press  dissidents  overseas,  and  it  creates  more  uncertainty  among
civil  society  and  the  business  community  regarding  their  future  in
Hong Kong.5

Background

Under Article  23  of  Hong  Kong’s  Basic  Law,  the  Hong  Kong  gov-
ernment  is  required  to  introduce  legislation  to  “prohibit  any  act  of
treason, secession, sedition, subversion against the Central People’s
Government,  or  theft  of  state  secrets,  to  prohibit  foreign  political
organizations  or  bodies  from  conducting  political  activities  in  the
Region,  and  to  prohibit  political  organizations  or  bodies  of  the  Re-
gion  from  establishing  ties  with  foreign  political  organizations  or
bodies.” 6 The Hong Kong government first tried to introduce Article
23  legislation  in  2003.  At  that  time,  Hong  Kong,  only  a  few  years
removed  from  British  rule,  still  had  vocal  independent  institutions
and civil society.7 That attempt to introduce a local national security
law was met by 500,000 protestors, which ultimately led the govern-
ment to abandon its proposal.8

In  2020,  the  central  government  in  Beijing  introduced  the  NSL,†
directly  applying  it  to  Hong  Kong  and  subjecting  Hong  Kong—for
the first time since the handover from British rule—to legal limita-
tions  on  political  activity  similar  to  the  Mainland.9  Four  years  of
NSL implementation has significantly narrowed political freedom in
Hong Kong, transforming Hong Kong’s civil society, gutting electoral
opposition, and paving the way for passing the Article 23 Ordinance
in Hong Kong’s own law.10

The  NSL  required  Article  23  legislation  to  be  completed  as  soon
as  possible.11  On  January  30,  2024,  Hong  Kong’s  government  be-
gan  a  consultation  period  for  the  Article  23  Ordinance  that  lasted
one month.12 The government claims that 99 percent of submissions
during  this  period  were  supportive  of  the  proposed  legislation,  and
“anti-China”  foreign  groups  were  attempting  to  smear  the  legisla-
tion  and  provoke  discontent.13  During  the  National  People’s  Con-
gress  in  March  in  Beijing,  Hong  Kong  officials  were  instructed  by
Politburo member and head of the Central Leading Group on Hong
Kong  and  Macau  Ding  Xuexiang  to  pass  the  legislation  as  quickly
as  possible.14  Lawmakers  moved  to  pass  the  legislation  within  two
weeks.15

New Offenses under the Article 23 Ordinance

The Article 23 Ordinance introduces a series of new offenses that
undermine the civil and legal rights of individuals, businesses, jour-
nalists, civil society groups, and international organizations in Hong
Kong and overseas, reflecting the wide reach of Xi’s vision for “holis-
tic” national security.* 16 These include:

 • Broadly  defining  acts  of  seditious  intention:  Expanding  upon
the  NSL,  the  Article  23  Ordinance  defines  a  “seditious  inten-
tion”  offense  to  include  intentionally  causing “hatred  or  enmity
amongst  different  classes  of  residents  of  the  [Hong  Kong  Spe-
cial  Administrative  Region]  or  amongst  residents  of  different
regions  of  China.” 17  Maximum  penalties  for  having  “seditious
publication[s]” were also increased to three years.18

 • New crimes to prevent coordinated activity: Concealment of oth-
ers’  activities  deemed  treasonous  under  the  national  security
law,  also  referred  to  as  misprision  of  treason,  was  codified  as
a  crime  in  the  Article  23  Ordinance.19  Failure  to  report  some-
one who is planning to commit treason could result in up to 14
years in jail.20

 • Expanding  the  definition  of  espionage  to  erode  free  speech  and
association:  The  Article  23  Ordinance  expands  the  definition
of  espionage  to  include  “collusion  with  ‘external  forces’  to  pub-
lish  false  or  misleading  statements”  with  intent  to  endanger
national  security.† 21  External  forces  could  refer  to  any  foreign
government,  agency,  individual,  political  party,  or  international
organization.22  Under  this  definition,  “collusion  with  external

* On April  15,  2014,  General  Secretary  Xi  Jinping  introduced  his  concept  of “holistic”  national
security. The  concept  emphasizes “mega  security”  encompassed  in  20  different  sectors,  including
political,  military,  economic,  cultural,  and  data  security,  among  others. The  Government  of  Hong
Kong  translates  the  Chinese  term  “总体”  as  “holistic,”  while  the  Commission  translates  this  as
“comprehensive”  national  security.  For  more  on  Xi’s  comprehensive  national  security  concept,
see  Chapter  7,  “China’s  New  Measures  for  Control,  Mobilization,  and  Resilience.”  Government
of  Hong  Kong,  A  Holistic Approach  to  National  Security  (总体国家安全观), April  15,  2024. Trans-
lation.

† Certain provisions of the National Security Law contain a mens rea element that the prohib-
ited  act  must  be  performed “with  intent  to  endanger  national  security”  to  constitute  an  offence.
In  practice,  this  intent  element  may  not  offer  much  protection  to  alleged  violators  given  the
broad  scope  of  “national  security”  and  that  trials  will  be  before  judges  especially  appointed  by
the Beijing-friendly Hong Kong chief executive to oversee NSL cases. Eric Y.H. Lai, “Implications
of  Article  23  Legislation  on  the  Future  of  Hong  Kong,  Jamestown  Foundation,  March  1,  2024;

Special Administrative Region, 2020.

forces” could potentially be applied to a broad variety of conduct
that  otherwise  would  generally  not  be  considered  criminal  or
even  harmful.23  For  example,  this  could  be  applied  to  a  Hong
Kong  resident  who  spoke  to  a  foreign  journalist,  exchanged  in-
formation  with  a  foreign  researcher,  or  posted  on  social  media
a foreign think tank’s report critiquing Hong Kong’s technology
sector.24

 • Supporting  external  “intelligence  organizations”:  The  Article
23  Ordinance  expands  the  definition  of  espionage  to  include
the  new  offense  of  “participating  in  or  supporting  external
intelligence  organizations  or  accepting  advantages  from
them.” 25 Under the Article 23 Ordinance, an “external intelli-
gence organization” may include “an organization established
by  an  external  force.” 26  The  ambiguity  of  the  term  leaves
China’s  National  Administration  for  the  Protection  of  State
Secrets  to  determine  whether  an  organization  is  considered
a  foreign  intelligence  organization.27  Potentially,  a  foreign
nongovernmental  organization  (NGO)  might  be  deemed  an
intelligence  organization.28

 • Broadening the scope of “external interference” to cover routine
political activity: The Article 23 Ordinance introduces “exter-
nal  interference”  as  a  new  criminal  offense  and  defines  it  as
the  intent,  in  collaboration  with  an  external  force,  to  bring
about  an  interference  effect,  which  refers  to  any  attempts  to
influence  mainland  or  Hong  Kong  government  officials,  elec-
tion  outcomes,  judicial  procedures,  or  the  Hong  Kong-Main-
land  relationship.29 This  criminalizes  a  broad  range  of  polit-
ical  activity.

 • “Endangering  national  security”  through  an  electronic  system
or  computer:  This  new  offense  expands  the  broad  definition  of
an “offense  endangering  national  security”  to  include  activities
related  to  computers  or  other  electronic  systems.30  This  vague
definition  could  potentially  encompass  Hong  Kongers  using  a
foreign  virtual  private  network  or  electronic  communication
apps,  for  instance,  to  share  content  that  allegedly  endangers
national security.31

 • Expanding  the  scope  of  state  secrets:  The  Article  23  Ordinance
imports  Beijing’s  vague  definition  of  state  secrets,  which  can
be  broadly  applied  to  information  relating  to  a  variety  of  sec-
tors,  like  scientific  research,  the  external  affairs  of  Hong  Kong,
and economic development.32 According to analysis by the Chi-
na  Strategic  Risks  Institute,  a  global  policy  think  tank,  the  ar-
bitrarily  defined  scope  of  state  secrets  could  apply  to  “normal
business  activities,  including  auditing,  economic  and  financial
analyses, and due diligence.” 33

The  first  conviction  under  the Article  23  Ordinance  came  in  Sep-
tember  2024,  when  a  Hong  Kong  man  pled  guilty  to  sedition  for
wearing a shirt with the slogan “Liberate Hong Kong; revolution of
our times.” 34

Hong  Kong’s  Political  and  Judicial  Systems

Subjugated  by Authoritarian  Overreach

Blurring  Political  Lines  between  Beijing  and  Hong  Kong’s

Electoral Systems

China promised that Hong Kong could maintain its distinctive-
ness  for  at  least  50  years  under  the  model  of  “one  country,  two
systems” after returning to mainland control.35 Contrary to these
commitments,  the  Chinese  government’s  overhaul  and  politiciza-
tion of Hong Kong’s electoral system has weakened its legitimacy,
resulting  in  a  significant  decline  in  political  participation.36  In
2023,  Hong  Kong  reduced  the  number  of  directly  elected  district
council  seats  by  80  percent *  and  implemented  new  rules  requir-
ing  candidates  to  prove  their  patriotism  and  be  screened  by  gov-
ernment  committees,  mostly  composed  of  pro-Beijing  appointees,
in  order  to  secure  nominations.37  Hong  Kong’s  district  council
elections  in  December  2023  reflected  the  government’s  changes,
which resulted in low turnout and the arrests of members of one
of the only pro-democracy parties in the city.38 Only 27.5 percent
of Hong Kong voters participated in the district council elections,
marking  the  lowest  turnout  in  these  polls  since  1997  when  Bei-
jing  took  control  of  the  city.† 39  Despite  the  record  low  turnout,
Hong  Kong  Chief  Executive  John  Lee  Ka-chiu  claimed  the  elec-
tions  demonstrated  voters’  support  for  the  process  and  referred
to previous district councils as “destructive” before the change in
rules.40  Members  of  the  League  of  Social  Democrats  (LSD),  one
of  Hong  Kong’s  only  remaining  pro-democracy  parties,  were  also
arrested ahead of the December elections for their plans to stage
a protest to the electoral rule changes.41 Hong Kong police arrest-
ed three LSD members for inciting others to disrupt or intervene
in  the  district  council  elections.42  Thomas  Kellogg,  executive  di-
rector  of  Georgetown  University’s  Center  for  Asian  Law,  empha-
sizes  the  dire  state  of  Hong  Kong’s  political  environment,  saying
“pro-democratic political activity in Hong Kong is over and likely
will remain off-limits for years to come.” 43 Others, like former U.S.
Consul General in Hong Kong and Macau Hanscom Smith, argue
that  a  delineation  can  still  be  made  between  the  Mainland  and
Hong Kong. Mr. Smith suggests that “despite an erosion in auton-
omy,  [Hong  Kong]  is  not  the  Mainland.” 44 A  May  2024  report  by
the Center for Strategic and International Studies suggests more
broadly  that  some  vestiges  of  autonomy  remain  in  Hong  Kong.45
The  report  also  notes  that  while  Hong  Kong  is “qualitatively  dif-
ferent  than  in  other  mainland  Chinese  jurisdictions,”  the  overall
trend  is  “clearly  in  the  direction  of  further  erosion  of  autonomy
across nearly all domains—the legal and political system and civ-
il  society,  as  well  as  the  climate  for  companies  and  investors.” 46

Hong Kong’s Judicial Independence Undermined

Judicial independence in Hong Kong continues to be undermined
by  government  overreach.  Prolonged  national  security  cases,  such
as  the  trials  of  Jimmy  Lai  and  the  Hong  Kong  47,*  illustrate  the
lack of judicial integrity in Hong Kong’s courts, where trial hearings
can be delayed by months and bail can be arbitrarily denied.47 Pro-
cedural  delays  in  the  legal  process  meant  that  many  of  the  Hong
Kong  47  were  held  for  over  two  years  awaiting  trial.48  On  May  30,
2024,  a  Hong  Kong  court  finally  announced  its  verdict  in  16  cases
of the Hong Kong 47 trial, the landmark national security case that
began  in  February  2023,  bringing  the  total  time  since  their  initial
arrest to nearly three and a half years.49 The court found 14 of the
defendants guilty and acquitted two—although the prosecution has
announced  plans  to  appeal  the  acquittals.† 50  Many  of  the  47  advo-
cates  have  been  detained  for  more  than  three  years  due  to  severe
bail  thresholds,  during  which  time  31  of  the  accused  pled  guilty.51
The  16  that  pled  not  guilty  could  face  up  to  life  in  prison.52  Jean-
Pierre Cabestan, senior research fellow at the Asia Centre, suggests
that  the  major  message  from  the  trials  to  Hong  Kong’s  society  is
“either  you  toe  the  line,  you  support  the  Communist  party,  or  you
are excluded from political life.” 53

The Article 23 Ordinance further erodes the legal rights of defen-
dants,  allowing  detention  for  up  to  16  days  (previously  two  days)
without charges, restricting access to certain lawyers, and tightening
national  security  trials,  bail,  and  parole.54  More  specifically,  in  the
first  48  hours  after  someone  is  arrested,  they  can  be  blocked  from
consulting  any  lawyer  and  then  denied  a  chosen  lawyer  while  they
remain  in  detention.55  In  addition,  the  Article  23  Ordinance  also
grants  discretionary  powers  to  the  chief  executive  to  issue  binding
certificates to courts and make subsidiary legislation at any time if
it  is  related  to “safeguarding  national  security.” 56  Due  to  the  broad
scope of the Article 23 Ordinance offenses, Hong Kong’s Beijing-ap-
pointed chief executive has ample opportunity to introduce arbitrary
laws.57

* Known as the “Hong Kong 47,” the group comprises activists, politicians, legislators, and civ-
il  society  leaders  who  were  opposed  to  the  central  government’s  overreach  into  Hong  Kong’s
electoral  process.  They  were  arrested  and  accused  of  holding  primary  elections  in  2021,  a  his-
torically common event ahead of elections, in order to help elect candidates who could challenge
pro-Beijing candidates in the main election. Helen Davidson and Verna Yu, “Hong Kong 47: Trial
of  Dozens  in  Pro-Democracy  Movement  Set  to  Begin  under  National  Security  Laws,”  Guardian,
February 4, 2023.

† Prior  to  the  NSL,  the  trial  would  have  been  before  a  jury,  not  judges  picked  by  the  Hong
Kong chief executive, and prosecutors would not have been able to appeal an acquittal. The NSL
allowed  national  security  cases  to  be  tried  by  a  panel  of  three  national  security  judges  instead
of a jury. The NSL also directed the chief executive to appoint certain judges to handle national
security  cases.  In  2023,  the  Hong  Kong  Department  of  Justice  proposed  an  amendment  that
would  break  from  prior  practice,  allowing  prosecutors  to  appeal  an  acquittal  under  the  NSL  by
High  Court  judges  on  the  basis  of  legal  error.  The  amendment  was  ultimately  adopted.  These
new judicial processes were implemented in the case of the Hong Kong 47. Jessie Yeung, Nectar

The  Hong  Kong  government  has  also  been  slow  to  fill  open  ju-
dicial  positions  within  the  Hong  Kong  courts  system,  further  pro-
longing  some  trials  and  undermining  the  integrity  of  the  courts.58
Consequently,  the  number  of  people  held  in  Hong  Kong  jails  con-
tinues to increase and their futures remain unclear given the back-
log  in  cases  being  heard.* 59  Alvin  Cheung  with  the  U.S.-Asia  Law
Institute  explains  that  “this  shortage  is  plainly  appalling  in  terms
of  how  it  prolongs  legal  limbo  for  defendants.” 60  Amid  the  lack  of
appointments, the number of filled judicial positions in the first half
of  2024  hovered  at  just  over  160  out  of  211  total  positions,  includ-
ing  national  security  judges,  with  the  High  Court  having  a  higher
vacancy  rate  than  other  Hong  Kong  courts.61  Despite  the  shortage,
no new judges have been appointed to the High Court since 2021.62
Underscoring  the  impact  of  the  NSL  and  increasing  role  of  Beijing
in  the  process,  Chief  Executive  Lee  only  appointed  three  out  of  the
six  potential  High  Court  judges  nominated  by  the  Judicial  Officers
Recommendation Commission (JORC) in 2021.63 Of the other three
put  forward  by  the  JORC,  one  failed  to  pass  a  national  security
background  check  and  another  candidate  backed  out  of  the  process
over  concerns  around  the  impact  of  the  2020  NSL  on  Hong  Kong’s
legal  landscape.64  Additionally,  the  JORC  has  not  made  any  new
recommendations for full-time judges in the last three years.65

Legal  professionals  have  been  hesitant  to  risk  reputational  and
career  damage  by  serving  as  a  judge  on  the  Hong  Kong  courts.66
In  June  2024,  after  the  prior  month’s  verdict  convicting  14  Hong
Kong  activists  and  politicians  of  national  security  violations,  three
non-permanent  foreign  judges  announced  their  resignations  from
positions on Hong Kong’s Court of Final Appeal.67 Jonathan Sump-
tion,  one  of  the  former  judges  and  a  British  citizen,  published  an
opinion piece in the Financial Times identifying a “growing malaise
in the Hong Kong judiciary” and claiming that Hong Kong “is slowly
becoming a totalitarian state.” 68 An additional two foreign non-per-
manent  judges  have  declined  to  renew  their  appointments  to  the
Court of Final Appeal as well this year.69

To  deter  civil  servants  and  judges  from  helping  implement  Hong
Kong’s national security laws, some U.S. lawmakers have introduced
legislation  calling  for  sanctions  on  members  of  the  Hong  Kong  le-
gal system involved in enforcement of the NSL.70 Some Hong Kong
dissidents  and  activists  applaud  these  sanctions,  arguing  that  they
stand  to  have  a  deterrent  effect  on  judges  and  prosecutors  in  the
city.71  Sanctions  on  these  individuals  would  prevent  them  from  in-
teracting  with  a  range  of  financial  institutions  and  severely  con-
strict  the  ability  of  these  individuals  to  make  international  pay-
ments.72  Former  Hong  Kong  Chief  Executive  Carrie  Lam  indicated

objections whenever sanctions have been imposed, including in 2020
and 2021.74

Hong Kong’s Extraterritorial Application of the National
Security Law

The  Hong  Kong  government  continues  to  extend  its  reach  by
adopting  an  extraterritorial  approach  to  enforcement  of  its  na-
tional  security  laws.  Since  July  2023,  Hong  Kong’s  National  Se-
curity  Police  have  placed  bounties  on  13  overseas  pro-democra-
cy  activists,  questioned  their  family  members,  and  attempted  to
intimidate  them.75  These  Hong  Kong  activists  include:  Nathan
Law,  Elmer  Yuen,  Dennis  Kwok,  Kevin  Yam,  Anna  Kwok,  Mung
Siu-tat,  Finn  Lau,  Ted  Hui,  Frances  Hui,  Joey  Siu,  Jonny  Fok,
Tony  Choi,  and  Simon  Cheng.76 All  of  the  activists  targeted  live
outside  of  Hong  Kong  as  dissidents  in  the  United  States,  Aus-
tralia,  and  the  United  Kingdom  (UK).77  Hong  Kong  police  have
accused these activists of “collusion with foreign country or exter-
nal  elements,”  “incitement  to  secession,”  and  “incitement  to  sub-
version.” 78 The bounties issued by police are worth approximately
$128,000  (Hong  Kong  Dollars  [HKD]  1  million)  for  information
that  may  lead  to  their  arrest;  if  caught,  activists  could  receive
sentences of up to life in prison.* 79 The family members of Hong
Kong  dissidents  are  also  targeted  and  harassed  for  their  rela-
tives’  pro-democracy  work  abroad.80  For  instance,  the  mother  of
U.S.-based activist Frances Hui was taken to a police station and
questioned in January 2024 after authorities issued a bounty for
her  daughter’s  arrest.81  The  Article  23  Ordinance  also  provides
a legal basis for requiring financial institutions to deny overseas
activists access to their bank accounts.82

Draconian Laws Threaten Civil Liberties
Academic Freedom

Four  years  into  implementation  of  the  NSL,  academic  freedom
in Hong Kong has dwindled as educators face pressure to politicize
their  curriculum  and  abide  by  national  security  requirements,  in-
cluding  the  Article  23  Ordinance.83  The  Patriotic  Education  Law †
officially took effect on January 1, 2024, and, according to the Hong
Kong  government,  aims  to  “strengthen  patriotic  education . . .  [and]
inherit and promote the spirit of patriotism.” 84 The government also
established  a  new  Working  Group  on  Patriotic  Education  to  inte-
grate  patriotic  education,  national  security  education,  and  Chinese
culture  education.85  Ahead  of  Hong  Kong’s  National  Security  Edu-
cation Day (April 15),‡ primary and secondary school teachers were
provided  a  script  to  read  to  students  that  explains  General  Sec-
retary  Xi’s  approach  to  national  security  and  describes  the  Article
23  Ordinance  as  creating  a  “safety  barrier”  for  the  city.86  Teachers

were instructed to host activities for students to teach them how to
protect  national  security  in  their  daily  lives.87  Hong  Kong  is  also
sending secondary school principals, teachers, and students to main-
land China for “national security education study tour[s].” 88 For ex-
ample, in April 2024, more than 70 educators and students traveled
to  Beijing,  Shanghai,  and  Hangzhou,  where  they  visited  sites  like
the  Museum  of  the  Communist  Party  of  China  and  the  National
Security Education Exhibition Hall.89

University  leadership  also  faces  pressure  to  make  their  institu-
tions  conform  not  to  standards  of  academic  freedom  but  to  stan-
dards  of  thought  approved  by  Beijing.  According  to  Carsten  Holz,
a  social  science  professor  at  Hong  Kong  University  of  Science  and
Technology,  the  Hong  Kong  government  expects  professors  and  ac-
ademic  leadership  to  police  their  institutions,  so  “it  is  no  surprise
that  at  least  four  vice-chancellors  of  Hong  Kong’s  seven  [publicly
funded]  universities  recently  resigned.” 90 After  facing  years  of  crit-
icism  by  pro-Beijing  policymakers  and  news  outlets,  vice-chancel-
lor  of  the  Chinese  University  of  Hong  Kong  (CUHK)  Rocky  Tuan
announced  that  he  would  resign  from  his  post  effective  January
2025.91  Mr.  Tuan  has  been  targeted  by  pro-Beijing  lawmakers  and
others since 2019 for his support of student protestors.92 Since then,
CUHK  has  been  singled  out  for  the  first  audit  of  a  university  in
Hong Kong by the city’s Audit Commission, which was described as
“a  form  of  harassment”  by  one  CUHK  academic.93  Former  CUHK
council member Tik Chi-yuen also argued that CUHK was targeted
by  the  Hong  Kong  legislature,  and Tuan’s  management  of  the  uni-
versity  was  scrutinized  politically.94  The  university  should  remain
free from political interference, Tik Chi-yuen said.95

Hong  Kong’s  schools  are  also  politicizing  their  curriculum  and
struggling  to  maintain  enrollment  numbers  among  local  students.
As enrollment from Hong Kong’s local students declines, some Hong
Kong  institutions  are  replacing  them  with  mainland  and  interna-
tional  students.96  Chief  Executive  Lee  announced  in  an  October
2023  speech  that  the  quota  of  overseas  and  mainland  students  at
Hong Kong’s public universities was set to increase from 20 percent
to  40  percent  as  a  part  of  the  government’s  push  to  make  the  city
an “international  hub  for  education  and  a  center  for  innovation.” 97
CUHK,  for  instance,  increased  its  annual  enrollment  quota  for
mainland students from 300 to 400 students for this year.98 In 2018,
mainland  students  accounted  for  50  percent  of  nonlocal  students
at  Hong  Kong’s  universities,  but  that  number  has  risen  to  more
than  70  percent  in  the  last  six  years.* 99 According  to  Hong  Kong’s
University Grants Committee, at the city’s main public universities,
there  are  14,756  nonlocal  undergraduate  students,  of  which  10,358
are from the Mainland.100 In an effort to attract more international
students  to  Hong  Kong,  the  grants  committee  is  giving  nearly  $4
million  to  eight  of  Hong  Kong’s  top  public  universities  to  promote
their programs overseas and attract new students.101

As  a  result  of  the  emigration  wave  and  declining  birthrates,  ap-
plications  for  Hong  Kong  kindergartens  decreased  by  a  third  from

* In  the  1996–1997  school  year,  there  were  just  five  mainland  Chinese  enrolled  in  Hong  Kong
undergraduate  programs.  South  China  Morning  Post, “Public  Universities  in  Hong  Kong Target

last  year’s  numbers.102  Vice-chair  of  the  Hong  Kong  Federation  of
Education  Workers  Nancy  Lam  Chui-ling  does  not  expect  the  emi-
gration wave to stop and notes in an interview that the application
numbers are likely even lower than those that are reported because
parents  will  typically  submit  multiple  applications  before  choosing
a school in which to enroll their child.103

Freedom of Press

Despite being enshrined in Hong Kong’s Basic Law, freedom of the
press * continues to be limited by the imposition of Hong Kong’s dra-
conian  security  laws. The  2020  NSL  is  used  to  suppress  journalists
on claims of combating “subversion,” “secession,” and “collusion with
foreign  forces.” 104  The  ambiguous  definitions  of  these  terms  in  the
NSL  allow  it  to  be  applied  broadly  to  independent  voices  residing
inside and outside of Hong Kong.105 Similar to the NSL, the Article
23  Ordinance  is  vaguely  worded,  allowing  judges  to  apply  the  law
arbitrarily.106  As  discussed  above,  the  Article  23  Ordinance  intro-
duces  new  crime  categories,  including  “theft  of  state  secrets,”  “ex-
ternal  interference,”  and  “espionage,”  which  have  been  weaponized
in the Mainland against press freedom.107 The Article 23 Ordinance
also extends the penalty for “sedition” from a maximum of two years
to up to ten years in prison.108 Merely possessing publications, such
as  old  copies  of  the  independent  newspaper  Apple  Daily,  founded
by  pro-democracy  advocate  Jimmy  Lai,  is  also  punishable  under
the  new  law  and  can  carry  a  three-year  jail  term.† 109  In  August
2024, two editors from the now shuttered pro-democracy media out-
let  Stand  News  were  found  guilty  of  sedition.110  The  editors  were
charged  before  the  imposition  of  the  Article  23  Ordinance  under  a
colonial-era sedition law that has been used in recent years to crack
down  on  press  viewed  as  critical  of  the  Hong  Kong  government.111
In  an  atmosphere  of  worsening  press  freedom,  the Article  23  Ordi-
nance gives Hong Kong and mainland authorities even greater pow-
ers  to  punish  members  of  the  media  viewed  as  supporting  pro-de-
mocracy activities.

As  Hong  Kong’s  press  freedom  is  further  repressed,  more  news
outlets  and  journalists  are  leaving  the  city,  and  others  are  blocked
from even entering. After almost three decades of operating in Hong
Kong, and shortly after the Article 23 Ordinance was enacted, Radio
Free  Asia  (RFA),  a  U.S.  government-funded  private  nonprofit  news
corporation,  closed  its  bureau  in  the  city  and  will  no  longer  have
full-time personnel in Hong Kong due to concerns with the worsen-
ing press freedom landscape.112 RFA president Bay Fang noted that
Hong  Kong  authorities’  reference  to  RFA  as  a  “foreign  force”  has
raised  “serious  questions  about  [RFA’s]  ability  to  operate  in  safety
with the enactment of Article 23.” 113 Several weeks after RFA’s de-

* Hong  Kong  is  ranked  135  out  of  180  countries  in  the  Reporters  Without  Borders  (RS)  2024
World  Press  Freedom  Index.  As  of  July  9,  2024,  ten  journalists  are  detained  in  Hong  Kong.
Reporters Without Borders, “2024 World Press Freedom Index—Journalism under Political Pres-
sure,” 2024.

† The crackdown on press deepens the threat to free speech. In 2020, Hong Kong passed a law
criminalizing  insulting  the  Chinese  national  anthem.  In  July  2024,  a  man  was  found  guilty  of
this  crime  from  an  incident  in  2023  where  he  covered  his  ears  during  the  anthem  at  a  sports
match and instead sang “Do You Hear the People Sing” from the musical Les Miserables. Hillary
Leung, “Hong  Kong  Man  Found  Guilty  of  Insulting  Chinese Anthem  at Volleyball  Game,”  Hong

parture, on April 10, 2024, a Reporters Without  Borders  (RSF)  rep-
resentative was detained and deported out of Hong Kong because of
plans to meet with journalists and monitor a hearing in Jimmy Lai’s
national  security  trial.114  In  a  statement  about  the  incident,  RSF
described it as “a new decline in the already poor press freedom cli-
mate in the territory.” 115 In April 2024, the Hong Kong-based South
China Morning Post (SCMP), which is owned by Chinese technology
giant Alibaba,  joined  its  mainland  counterparts  in  withdrawing  its
membership from the Society of Publishers in Asia (SOPA) and lim-
ited its submissions for the society’s regional journalism awards.116
Among the SCMP’s finalist SOPA entries this year is an entrant for
“excellence in photography.” 117 The SCMP, like many other Chinese
publications,  had  faced  criticism  from  the  Mainland  for  its  investi-
gations and research in the Mainland, including investigations crit-
ical of the Chinese government.118

The Wall Street Journal also announced it would move its region-
al headquarters to Singapore, and it laid off editors and reporters at
its Hong Kong bureau in May 2024.119 Selina Cheng, one of the re-
maining staff reporters after the Wall Street Journal’s initial round
of  layoffs,  claims  the  Wall  Street  Journal  reversed  course  and  fired
her in July after she was elected chair of the Hong Kong Journalists
Association  (HKJA).120  HKJA  advocates  for  press  freedom,  includ-
ing releasing an annual report on the state of freedom of expression
in Hong Kong and raising concerns during the Article 23 Ordinance
public  consultation  period.121  Chinese  state  media  has  denigrated
HKJA  and  its  members  for  “badmouthing”  China.122  This  incident
highlights the pressures on foreign media to self-censor in line with
the  CCP’s  requirements  on  media,  and  it  calls  into  question  claims
that foreign businesses have been unaffected by the new atmosphere
following the passage of the NSL and Article 23 Ordinance.

Growth of the Surveillance State in Hong Kong

As  Hong  Kong’s  governance  continues  to  converge  with  the
Mainland, the city is increasingly adopting the methods of a sur-
veillance  state.  In  February  2024,  the  Hong  Kong  government
announced  plans  to  install  2,000*  more  cameras  across  the  city
in  partnership  with  the  Hong  Kong  police,  raising  privacy  con-
cerns among the public about how the technology may be used to
surveil  Hong  Kongers.123  Hong  Kong  Police  Commissioner  Ray-
mond Siu Chak-yee claimed the cameras would be used to combat
crimes  and  ensure  residents’  safety,  but  he  also  noted  that  the
police  force  would  not  rule  out  using  facial  recognition  technolo-
gy  in  its  surveillance  system.124  In  addition  to  the  new  cameras,
last  year  Hong  Kong’s  police  force  requested  funding  to  upgrade
bodycams  and  related  technologies  by  building  a  new  5G  sys-
tem.125  While  police  bodycams  have  garnered  support  from  civil

* The government of Hong Kong does not maintain a count of the number of public surveillance
cameras  deployed  in  the  city  by  various  government  agencies,  although  the  police  force  claims
that  these  2,000  cameras  are  the  total  amount  of  cameras  they  will  have  deployed.  Estimates
from  Comparitech  put  the  total  number  of  CCTV  cameras  in  Hong  Kong  at  just  below  55,000.

Growth of the Surveillance State in Hong Kong—Continued

society under certain conditions in free countries like the United
States, against an increasingly authoritarian trend in Hong Kong,
this  effort  raised  concerns  that  Hong  Kong’s  digital  surveillance
network may become more like China’s facial recognition system
Skynet, which is used to squash political opposition.126 Executive
Director  of  the  Japan  Hong  Kong  Democracy  Alliance  Alric  Lee
notes that the combination of new surveillance cameras with the
“suite  of  new  ‘national  security’  offenses”  in  the  Article  23  Ordi-
nance could enable Hong Kong’s police to monitor people remote-
ly.127 Mr. Lee further explains that “used in conjunction with the
Article 23 legislation, [surveillance cameras] could become a new
tool for prosecutions.” 128 Additionally, the Hong Kong police bud-
get  for  fiscal  year  2024–2025  will  reach  $3.6  billion  (HKD  27.8
billion), up 9.2 percent over the prior year.129 The budget includes
a  16.7  percent  increase  for  “rewards  and  special  services”  that
will cover bounties and payments to informers.130

Freedom of Assembly and Association

Freedoms  of  assembly  and  association  face  further  assault  in
Hong  Kong  this  year.  Under  the  Article  23  Ordinance,  exercising
freedoms  of  assembly  and  association  can  be  criminalized.  Peace-
ful  civil  society  activism  can  be  subject  to  heavy-handed  penalties,
including  long  prison  sentences.131  Protests  in  2019  involved  occu-
pying  roads  and  stalling  traffic,  which  under  the  new  law  could  re-
sult  in  up  to  20-year  prison  sentences  for  activities  that  “weaken”
public  transportation,  infrastructure,  or  offices.132  The  Article  23
Ordinance  may  also  place  constraints  on  civil  society  organizations
by criminalizing “external interference,” including “improper means”
to  collaborate  with  external  political  organizations  or  international
organizations  that  are  seen  as “bring[ing]  about  an  interference  ef-
fect.” 133 In practice, this could criminalize actions such as criticizing
the Hong Kong government’s human rights record or calling on for-
eign  governments  to  hold  the  Hong  Kong  government  accountable
for  protecting  human  rights.134  Additionally,  the  Article  23  Ordi-
nance  imposes  severe  sentences  for  peaceful  civil  society  activities,
such  as  up  to  a  14-year  prison  sentence  and  a  maximum  fine  of
$130,000 for managing a prohibited organization or up to ten years
in  prison  and  a  fine  of  $32,000  for  participating  in  a  meeting  with
a  banned  organization.135  Amnesty  International’s  China  Director
Sarah Brooks explains that this legislation “could lead to the prose-
cution of activists for their exchanges with foreign actors, framed as
‘endangering national security.’ ” 136

Hong  Kong  police  conducted  their  first  arrests  under  the  Article
23  Ordinance  in  May  2024  for  alleged  acts  of  “seditious  intent”  to
incite  people  to  unlawfully  assemble  on  a  “sensitive  date.” 137  One
of  the  individuals  arrested,  Chow  Hang-tung,  was  already  serving
a  more  than  30-month  jail  sentence  for  charges  of  “unauthorized
assembly”  for  organizing  a  vigil  to  commemorate  the  Tiananmen
Square  massacre.138  According  to  several  news  reports,  her  most
recent  arrest  in  May  2024  was  linked  to  a  Facebook  group  page  ti-

700

tled “Chow Hang-tung Club” that had asked members to share their
experiences with past Tiananmen vigils.139

Freedom of Religion

International  experts  on  freedom  of  religion  have  also  expressed
concerns  with  how  the  Article  23  Ordinance  will  impact  religious
freedom in Hong Kong. While Hong Kong’s religious communities do
not  yet  face  the  same  degree  of  persecution  as  those  in  the  Main-
land,  religious  leaders  face  pressure  to  promote  Beijing’s  priorities,
including  the  sinicization  of  religion.140  Those  who  do  not  comply
face legal consequences. Cardinal Joseph Zen, a senior Roman Cath-
olic  cleric  in  Hong  Kong  and  a  critic  of  the  CCP  and  outspoken
advocate  for  human  rights,  was  arrested  and  fined  in  2022  for  fail-
ing  to  register  a  humanitarian  fund  that  provided  financial  aid  to
those  arrested  in  the  2019  pro-democracy  protests.141 Then  United
States  Commission  on  International  Religious  Freedom *  Commis-
sioner  Frank  R.  Wolf  cited  this  as  another  example  of  how  Hong
Kong is “devolving into an increasingly repressive society where no
one resisting government tyranny is safe, including religious leaders
and  communities.” 142 A  January  2024  report  by  the  Committee  for
Freedom in Hong Kong Foundation describes the deterioration of re-
ligious freedom in Hong Kong and “warning signs of what’s to come,”
including  the  intimidation  of  clergy,  self-censorship,  and  direct  at-
tacks  on  religious  practices.143  Hong  Kong’s  religious  leaders  are
increasingly  making  visits  to  the  Mainland  to  meet  with  religious
and other leaders approved by Beijing. For instance, in August 2023,
a  delegation  of  Islamic  leaders  from  Hong  Kong  visited  Xinjiang,
where  they  met  with  the  Islamic Association  of  China  and  at  least
one  voiced  support  for  the  situation  there,  which  includes  harsh
measures  restricting  the  practice  of  Islam.144  During  the  visit,  the
chairman  of  the  Islamic  Union  of  Hong  Kong  contributed  to  Party
propaganda  in  an  interview  with  Chinese  state  media  by  claiming
that  his  “compatriots  living  in  Xinjiang  are  very  happy  and  joyful,
fully enjoying religious freedom and are well-respected.” 145 In April
2024, Catholic Cardinal Stephen Chow visited the Mainland for the
second  time  since  Beijing  and  the  Vatican  jointly  appointed  him  a
bishop of Hong Kong in 2020.† 146 During his visit, he met with dio-
ceses in Guangzhou and Shantou—cities in Southern China in fairly
close  proximity  to  Hong  Kong—which  both  have  bishops  approved
by  Beijing  and  the Vatican.147  Cardinal  Chow’s  remarks  during  his
engagements  reportedly  emphasized  respect  for  different  customs
and cultures.148 Comparing the church in Guangdong to the church
in Vietnam, Cardinal Chow even noted that both churches have re-
mained  under  communist  rule  for  many  years  and  are  functioning
well.149

In March 2024, more than a dozen activists and religious freedom
experts  expressed  “profound  and  grave  concerns”  about  the  effects

Report that increased political pressure after the imposition of the NSL has led to self-censorship

Freedom, 2024 Annual Report, May 2024, 23.

of  the Article  23  Ordinance,  specifically  how  it  will  impact  the  Sac-
rament of Penance, also known as Confession.150 According to Hong
Kong’s Secretary for Justice Paul Lam Ting-kwok, under the Article
23 Ordinance, a person can receive up to 14 years in prison for fail-
ing  to  disclose  the  commission  of  treason  by  others.151 This  means
that under the law, a priest could be forced to share what has been
disclosed  to  them  during  Confession,  a  direct  violation  of  the  Uni-
versal  Declaration  of  Human  Rights.152 As  the  statement  made  by
a  group  of  advocacy  organizations  notes,  the  Article  23  Ordinance
has  “grave  implications  for  the  confidentiality  of  Confession  in  the
Catholic Church and other Christian traditions.” 153

Economics and Trade

Beijing’s  influence  over  Hong  Kong’s  economic,  trade,  and  finan-
cial sectors has intensified. The Hong Kong government’s implemen-
tation  of  the  Article  23  Ordinance  has  called  into  question  many
of  the  distinctive  features  that  allowed  Hong  Kong  to  flourish  as  a
regional  business  hub.  Under  the  provisions  of  the Article  23  Ordi-
nance, foreign businesses in Hong Kong could be severely limited in
routine  business  activities  such  as  accessing  data,  contacting  over-
seas counterparts, and conducting due diligence.154 Some businesses
have begun proactively separating their Hong Kong operations from
other  global  offices  or  asking  staff  to  use  burner  phones  as  a  pre-
cautionary measure while visiting the city.155 This is the latest step
in  Hong  Kong’s  forced  integration  with  the  Mainland,  as  the  Hong
Kong business environment increasingly resembles other large Chi-
nese cities.156 Cross-border commerce and migration boost these ties,
as  Hong  Kong  is  now  a  central  node  in  China’s  Greater  Bay  Area
(GBA), an initiative by China to combine Hong Kong with surround-
ing  Chinese  cities  to  form  a  single  economic  and  business  hub.157
Faced  with  Hong  Kong’s  dwindling  international  stature,  slumping
markets,  and  constrictive  legal  environment,  some  U.S.  firms  and
other multinationals continue to depart the city, while those that re-
main  face  an  uncertain  business  environment.158  Meanwhile,  Hong
Kong  aids  China  in  utilizing  Hong  Kong’s  port  to  evade  sanctions
and serves as a key node in a transshipment network of illicit goods
to Russia, while the Hong Kong Economics and Trade Offices act as
a conduit of mainland interests.159

Hong Kong Economy, Markets Remain Sluggish

Hong  Kong’s  economy  has  been  sluggish  in  recent  years  as  it
emerged  from  a  period  of  social  unrest  and  COVID-19  lockdowns,
which  contributed  to  the  city’s  contracting  gross  domestic  product
(GDP) in three of the four years from 2019 to 2022.160 Natixis esti-
mates that the city’s strict COVID-19 measures alone, which lasted
into  early  2023,  cost  the  city  $27  billion  in  growth.161  Hong  Kong
experienced weak cumulative GDP growth of only 5 percent over the
five  years  from  2019  to  2023.* 162  In  contrast,  the  five-year  period
from 2014 to 2018 saw GDP grow over 24 percent.163 Although the
Hong  Kong  economy  grew  moderately  in  2023  and  the  first  half  of
2024,  posting  growth  rates  of  3.2  percent  and  3.0  percent,  respec-

tively,  compared  with  the  same  periods  in  the  prior  year,  weakness
persists  in  some  segments.164  Youth  labor  force  participation  rates
fell from 40 percent in 2018 to 30 percent in 2023, while young peo-
ple face uncertainty about their futures in Hong Kong.165 (For more
on  youth  unemployment  in  China,  see  Chapter  1,  “Economics  and
Trade (Year in Review).”) Businesses are not flocking to Hong Kong
as  they  once  were.  While  Hong  Kong  attracted  497  foreign  compa-
nies  in  2019,  it  drew  in  only  255  overseas  companies  in  2023.166
Meanwhile,  regional  competitor  Singapore,  which  once  had  a  GDP
per capita equal to Hong Kong’s in the early 2000s, surpassed Hong
Kong’s  GDP  in  real  terms  in  2016  and  now  has  a  GDP  per  capita
about 70 percent higher than Hong Kong’s as of 2023.167

Amid  its  slowing  economy,  Hong  Kong  faces  a  budget  shortfall  of
$13 billion (HKD 101.6 billion) for the 2023–2024 fiscal year, nearly
double the government’s initial projections.168 This is the second year
in  a  row  the  Hong  Kong  government  is  facing  a  sizeable  deficit.169
Despite  this  shortfall,  the  Department  of  Finance  continues  to  use
fiscal  policy  and  subsidies  to  try  to  stimulate  demand,  particularly
in  the  housing  market.170  There  has  been  a  steady  rise  in  unsold
housing in Hong Kong, an issue that emerged in part due to a wave
of departures from Hong Kong following the introduction of nation-
al security legislation.* 171 Compared with pre-COVID, Hong Kong’s
labor  force  was  4  percent  lower  at  the  end  of  2023,  and  the  num-
ber  of  foreign  firms  had  declined  by  5.2  percent  as  of  mid-2023.172
As  of  June  2024,  150,400  Hong  Kongers,  or  about  2  percent  of  the
population, had left the city for the UK alone under the British Na-
tional  (Overseas)  visa  scheme.† 173  Data  from  Jones  Lang  LaSalle
now  show  that  residential  units  available  in  the  primary  market
increased 6 percent to 91,300 units in the fourth quarter of 2023.174
This is a 74 percent increase in empty Hong Kong apartments since
2020.175 As of the end of 2023, Hong Kong housing prices were down
20  percent  from  their  2021  peak,  with  financial  services  company
UBS  projecting  another  10  percent  decline  in  2024.176  Burgeoning
difficulty  in  the  housing  market  poses  particular  problems  for  the
Hong  Kong  government,  as  land  sales  contribute  around  one-fifth
of its fiscal revenue.177 In his budget rollout speech, Finance Secre-
tary Paul Chan announced measures to address the housing market
slump, including the removal of longstanding real estate restrictions
aimed at curbing speculation and preventing property bubbles.178 In
February  2024,  Hong  Kong  eliminated  a  7.5  percent  stamp  tax  on
second  home  purchases,  a  7.5  percent  stamp  tax  on  nonpermanent
residents  buying  property,  and  a  10–20  percent  stamp  tax  on  those
selling  their  homes  within  two  years  of  purchase.179  The  govern-
ment  also  relaxed  lending  policies  and  introduced  further  stimulus
to  boost  housing  demand.180  While  the  efficacy  of  these  stimulus

efforts has yet to be borne out, these efforts also face market imped-
iments, including elevated interest rates in Hong Kong.181

China’s  actions  to  undermine  Hong  Kong’s  autonomy,  including
the  passing  of  the  Article  23  Ordinance,  have  eroded  Hong  Kong’s
status  as  a  global  financial  center.  Hong  Kong’s  Hang  Seng  Index
has  plunged  under  tighter  mainland  rule,  falling  below  15,000  on
January  22,  2024,  marking  less  than  half  of  its  peak  of  33,154.1  in
January 2018 before the introduction of the Beijing-backed national
security  legislation.182  Illustrating  the  stark  economic  reality  since
mainland  China  assumed  control  of  Hong  Kong,  the  Hang  Seng
Index  in  January  2024  declined  below  16,365  points,  lower  than
its  value  on  July  1,  1997,  the  day  China  took  over  Hong  Kong.183
During the same time period, Hong Kong’s GDP more than doubled
from  $177  billion  to  $382  billion,  while  investors  in  the  S&P  500
saw their stock investments grow more than four times.184

The decline of Hong Kong’s stock markets in recent years is ad-
mittedly  difficult  to  disentangle  from  their  close  alignment  with
mainland  markets  and  Hong  Kong’s  stringent  COVID  restric-
tions. Hong Kong’s COVID pandemic controls included mandatory
testing and quarantines for positive cases and international trav-
elers.* 185  Hong  Kong  relaxed  its  strict  travel  controls  in  2022  in
attempts  to  boost  economic  growth  and  attract  foreign  business
back  to  the  city,  but  the  economy  still  contracted  that  year.186
In  recent  years,  the  close  integration  between  financial  markets
in  Hong  Kong  and  the  Mainland  has  been  detrimental  due  to
broader challenges in the Chinese economy. (For more on China’s
economic  challenges,  see  Chapter  1, “Economics  and Trade  (Year
in  Review).”)  Since  China’s  opening  to  foreign  trade  and  invest-
ment  in  the  late  1970s,  Hong  Kong’s  markets  have  been  closely
aligned with the Mainland economy as part of China’s strategy to
attract  foreign  capital.187  Mainland  Chinese  companies  by  2023
accounted  for  76  percent  of  the  index’s  market  capitalization.188
Many  major  firms  are  dual-listed  on  both  Hong  Kong  and  main-
land  exchanges.† 189  These  dual  listings  align  with  Beijing’s  ob-
jective  of  integrating  Hong  Kong’s  markets  with  the  Mainland
and  are  complimented  by  Beijing’s  promotion  of  the  Connect
programs.‡ 190 The  first  of  these,  the  Stock  Connect,  linked  Hong
Kong  to  mainland  stock  exchanges  beginning  in  2014.191  The
program  enabled  overseas  investors  to  participate  in  mainland
stock and, starting in 2022, exchange-traded fund (ETF) markets
via  Hong  Kong  and  allowed  mainland  investors  to  participate  in
Hong  Kong’s  market.192  In  2017,  the  Bond  Connect  was  intro-
duced,  expanding  the  program  to  fixed  income  products.193  The

latest  program,  Swap  Connect,  launched  in  2023,  enables  over-
seas  investors  to  participate  in  the  Mainland’s  financial  deriva-
tives  market  through  interest  rate  swaps.194  An  announcement
in  2024  by  the  China  Securities  Regulatory  Commission  (CSRC)
seeks  to  further  broaden  the  Stock  Connect  program  to  include
real  estate  investment  trusts  and  yuan-denominated  stocks  list-
ed  in  Hong  Kong  while  expanding  access  to  ETFs  between  Hong
Kong  and  the  Mainland.195

Analysts  have  attributed  Hong  Kong’s  market  downturn  to  Chi-
na’s increased control over Hong Kong. Stephen Roach, senior fellow
at the Paul Tsai China Center at Yale Law School and former chair
of  Morgan  Stanley  Asia,  indicates  that  a  major  catalyst  of  Hong
Kong’s  prolonged  market  slump  was  the  city’s  political  crackdowns
of  2019–2020,  which  “shredded  any  remaining  semblance  of  local
political autonomy. The 50-year transition period to full takeover by
the  People’s  Republic  of  China  had  been  effectively  cut  in  half.” 196
Victoria Tin-bor Hui, a political science professor at the University of
Notre  Dame,  also  implicates  the  recent  national  security  measures
in  Hong  Kong’s  diminished  status,  saying,  “Beijing’s  ideal  scenario
is to keep Hong Kong as a financial center without all the freedom.
But  it  seems  that  you  really  cannot  maintain  Hong  Kong’s  inter-
national  financial  standing  while  stifling  its  freedom.” 197  Analysts
estimate  that  Chinese  and  Hong  Kong  markets  collectively  lost  a
staggering $6 trillion since 2021.198 While the top 300 companies in
the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges declined by more than
40  percent  from  January  2021  to  January  2024,  shares  of  Chinese
stocks listed in Hong Kong fared even worse, plummeting by over 50
percent  during  the  same  period.199  The  Hang  Seng  Index  declined
by  44–45  percent  as  well.200 This  decline  has  harmed  business  op-
erations in Hong Kong, including among law firms, which have sold
off  office  space  amid  a  lack  of  initial  public  offerings  (IPOs),  merg-
ers, and acquisitions these firms typically work on.201 (For more on

Hong Kong Nascent Cryptocurrency Sector Faces
Mainland Prohibitions

Hong  Kong  is  pushing  to  become  a  hub  for  digital  assets
and  cryptocurrency,  viewed  as  a  means  to  attract  both  capi-
tal  and  financial  firms  back  to  the  city.* 202  In  2022,  the  Hong
Kong government formalized a process to license cryptocurren-
cy  platforms  to  operate  in  Hong  Kong.203 Two  crypto  exchang-
es  were  licensed  under  a  previous  voluntary  licensing  process
and hold full permits to operate in Hong Kong.204 Eleven more
firms  were  “deemed  to  be  licensed”  as  of  June  2024,  meaning
they  can  operate  while  the  Hong  Kong  Securities  and  Futures
Commission  performs  an  ongoing  review  of  their  compliance
procedures.205 The  city  aims  to  be  a “global  hub”  for  the  cryp-
tocurrency  sector,  according  to  the  chief  executive  of  the  city’s

Mainland Prohibitions—Continued
financial regulatory agency, the Hong Kong Monetary Authori-
ty (HKMA).206 Previously, the HKMA has reportedly pressured
lenders—including HSBC and Standard Chartered—to take on
crypto  exchanges  as  clients.207

Hong  Kong’s  ambitions  to  become  a  global  cryptocurrency  hub
are  tempered,  however,  by  mainland  restrictions,  where  trading
in  cryptocurrency  is  strictly  prohibited.208  China  outlawed  cryp-
tocurrency  trading  and  payments  in  2013,  but  it  intensified  its
crackdown  on  the  industry  in  2021,  targeting  domestic  mining
operations  and  foreign  firms  that  were  providing  services  to
mainland Chinese.209 Mainland regulators appear to be intent on
keeping  Hong  Kong’s  burgeoning  cryptocurrency  ambitions  away
from  mainland  users;  a  June  notice  from  financial  regulators
in  Shenzhen,  just  north  of  Hong  Kong,  offered  stern  warnings
to  overseas  crypto  platforms  and  Chinese  residents,  reiterating
that  cryptocurrency-related  activities  remain  illegal  in  mainland
China.210  New  regulations  in  Hong  Kong  require  cryptocurrency
exchanges  licensed  in  the  city  to  commit  to  not  serving  Chinese
nationals—not  only  those  trading  in  China  but  trading  in  any
region.211  This  regulation  was  criticized  by  Legislative  Council
(LegCo)  member  Duncan  Chiu  as  “impossible  for  traditional  off-
shore  exchanges  to  meet”  and  for  having “shaken  the  confidence
of  market  participants.” 212  In  light  of  these  restrictions  barring
Mainlanders  from  accessing  cryptocurrency  platforms,  an  addi-
tional  11  crypto  firms  withdrew  their  applications  to  operate  in
Hong  Kong,  some  of  which  were  originally  affiliated  with  oper-
ations  in  mainland  China  that  departed  after  the  2021  crack-
down.213 Bybit, a crypto firm headquartered in Dubai and one of
the firms that withdrew its application, later announced it would
allow  Chinese  citizens  who  live  outside  of  the  country  to  trade
crypto on its platform.214

Beijing  in  the  past  has  appeared  to  quietly  back  Hong  Kong’s
cryptocurrency  ambitions,  with  representatives  from  the  central
government’s Liaison Office attending several Hong Kong confer-
ences  on  cryptocurrency  in  the  city.215 Although  the  People’s  Re-
public  of  China  has  not  publicly  voiced  support  for  Hong  Kong’s
experimentation  with  cryptocurrency,  according  to  one  industry
participant,  it  may  view  Hong  Kong  as  a  way  to  test  the  func-
tionality  of  digital  assets  in  a  limited  fashion.216  However,  as
Beijing  still  tightly  restricts  mainland  Chinese  from  trading  or
using  cryptocurrency,  Beijing’s  motives  for  allowing  Hong  Kong
to play a key role in cryptocurrency networks may also be related
to  crypto’s  role  in  sanctions  evasion.  Settlements  for  illicit  Rus-
sian commodities trade made in cryptocurrency have been routed
through  Hong  Kong.217  (For  more  on  Hong  Kong’s  role  in  sanc-
tions  evasion  and  transshipment,  see  the  textbox  “Hong  Kong
Serves  as  Key  Hub  for  Transshipments  and  Support  to  Russia”

The Article 23 Ordinance Continues to Weigh on International

Business

Due to the imposition of the Article 23 Ordinance and the broad-
er  NSL,  U.S.  firms  operating  in  Hong  Kong  are  now  grappling
with  a  complex  and  unsettling  regulatory  environment.  Thomas
Kellogg, executive director of Georgetown University’s Center for
Asian  Law,  cautioned  in  an  interview  with  Bloomberg  News  that
these  laws  introduced  uncertainty  for  Hong  Kong  business  and
the  city’s  status  as  a  financial  hub.218  This  includes  provisions
in  the  Article  23  Ordinance  that  could  significantly  restrict  the
ability  of  chambers  of  commerce,  think  tanks,  and  economic  ana-
lysts  to  freely  discuss  and  share  information.219  Dennis  Kwok,  a
lawyer  and  past  member  of  the  Hong  Kong  LegCo,  echoed  these
concerns,  emphasizing  that  the  broad  language  in  the  Article  23
Ordinance regarding “external forces” and “external interference”
could be applied against a wide range of business activity, includ-
ing  “against  the  normal  advocacy,  lobbying,  academic  research
and  reporting  activities  of  any  foreign  business  headquartered
overseas, as well as [against] NGOs that engage with foreign gov-
ernments.” 220  A  local  barrister  warned  that  the  vague  definition
of  state  secrets  means  people  risk  violating  the  law  by  merely
commenting  on  the  state  of  Hong  Kong’s  economy.221

The  ability  of  investors  to  conduct  due  diligence  on  Chinese  and
Hong  Kong  firms  also  risks  being  restricted  under  the  Article  23
Ordinance.222 The ordinance’s strict language on data flows and co-
operating  with  “foreign  forces”  may  block  due  diligence  firms  from
accessing  needed  business  information  and  making  disclosures  re-
garding Hong Kong and Chinese companies.223 The Chinese govern-
ment had already raided the operations of U.S.-based  due diligence
and  consulting  firms  on  the  Mainland  before  expanding  the  defini-
tion  of  espionage  under  a  parallel  legal  authority.224  Legal  experts
have raised concerns that the rules under the Article 23 Ordinance
could impact an existing agreement between China and the United
States  that  allows  the  U.S.  Public  Company  Accounting  Oversight
Board (PCAOB) to conduct inspections in Hong Kong of Chinese ac-
counting firms that have audited firms publicly traded in the United
States.225

Reflecting the unprecedented scope of the Article 23 Ordinance, in
September  2024  the  U.S.  Departments  of  State,  Treasury,  Agricul-
ture,  Commerce,  and  Homeland  Security  jointly  released  an  updat-
ed Hong Kong Business Advisory highlighting potential reputation-
al,  regulatory,  financial,  and  legal  risks  to  U.S.  companies  in  Hong
Kong.* 226 These new risks are a result of the erosion of Hong Kong’s
autonomy from the Mainland and the criminalization of many activ-
ities  that  were  previously  considered  routine  business  activities.227
The  advisory  also  calls  out  Hong  Kong’s  growing  role  in  sanctions
and  export  control  evasion.228  (For  more  on  Hong  Kong’s  role  in
sanctions and export control evasion, see “Hong Kong Serves as Key
Hub for Transshipments and Support to Russia” in this chapter.)

* This  business  advisory  updated  a  2021  Hong  Kong  Business  Advisory  jointly  issued  by  the
U.S.  Departments  of  State, Treasury,  Commerce,  and  Homeland  Security  in  the  wake  of  the  im-
position of the NSL. The 2021 business advisory highlighted risks associated with the NSL, data
privacy,  access  to  information,  and  exposure  to  sanctioned  entities  or  individuals.  U.S.  Depart-

Foreign Businesses Limit Activity, Take Protective Steps

The Article  23  Ordinance  poses  significant  practical  challenges
for business and legal activity that is routine in a market economy
under the rule of law. As an example, after the implementation of
the Article 23 Ordinance, which includes restrictions on database
access,  law  firm  Latham  &  Watkins  reportedly  took  measures  to
safeguard its data from Hong Kong’s authorities.229 The move by
Latham & Watkins, the world’s second-highest-grossing law firm,
is  viewed  as  aligning  the  firm’s  Hong  Kong  data  security  regula-
tions  with  those  of  its  operations  on  the  Mainland.230  Under  the
new  changes  reportedly  announced  in  February  2024,  Latham  &
Watkins’  Hong  Kong-based  staff  would  require  specific  permis-
sion to access international databases.231 This decision effectively
severs  unrestricted  access  for  its  Hong  Kong-based  lawyers  to
international  databases  in  the  United  States,  Europe,  and  the
rest  of  Asia.232  Instead,  under  Hong  Kong’s  increasingly  strict
data  regime,  the  firm  is  reportedly  combining  its  Hong  Kong  da-
tabase with the Mainland under the umbrella of “Greater China,”
a  segment  of  Latham  &  Watkins  operations  that  will  be  siloed
off  from  the  rest  of  the  firm’s  global  research.233  In  an  interview
with  the  Financial  Times,  two  individuals  familiar  with  Latham
& Watkins’ decision explained that this action aims to limit data
access in the event of a raid by Hong Kong authorities under the
NSL.234  During  such  a  raid,  Hong  Kong  authorities  would  only
be  able  to  access  the  firm’s  China  and  Hong  Kong  databases.235
Meanwhile,  a  wave  of  U.S.-based  firms  in  the  legal  sector  contin-
ues  to  pull  back  from  Hong  Kong,  with  several  citing  the  city’s
diminishing  role  as  a  major  legal  market  among  other  challeng-
es;  as  of  August  2024,  law  firms  that  have  pulled  back  from  or
closed  their  Hong  Kong  offices  include  Mayer  Brown; Addleshaw
Goddard; Winston & Strawn; Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe; DLA
Piper;  Dechert;  and  Baker  Botts.236  Through  May  2024,  overall
mergers  and  acquisitions  activity  in  Hong  Kong  was  at  its  low-
est  level  since  2012,  which  has  contributed  to  the  exodus  of  law
firms, as they earn high fees from this activity.237 Law firms have
also been wary of working on deals involving Chinese state-owned
companies  because  of  due  diligence  or  security  concerns.238  The
net  number  of  new  members  joining  Hong  Kong’s  Law  Society
in  2023  declined  83  percent  compared  with  2020,  while  new  law
school  graduates  have  reportedly  experienced  difficulty  securing
jobs.239

Hong Kong’s focus on national security continues to be panned
more generally by the U.S. business community in Hong Kong.240
According  to  the  American  Chamber  of  Commerce  (AmCham)  in
Hong Kong’s Business Sentiment Survey 2024, 67 percent of Am-
Cham members  identified “reduced rhetoric on national security”
as  the  most  effective  measure  to  enhance  U.S.-Hong  Kong  rela-
tions,  making  it  the  top  choice  among  all  survey  participants.241
The  same  survey,  which  was  conducted  prior  to  the  passage  of
the Article  23  Ordinance,  found  that  31  percent  of  recipients  felt
operations  had  been  negatively  impacted  by  the  NSL,  mostly  in-
directly  but  some  through  departures  of  employees,  lower  staff
morale,  or  extra  resources  spent  on  compliance.242

Erosion of the Rule of Law: Legal Rulings Target Foreign Firms

Hong  Kong’s  LegCo  introduced  the  Article  23  Ordinance  within
two  months  of  the  effective  date  of  legislation  permitting  the  en-
forcement of mainland Chinese court rulings in Hong Kong for civil
and  commercial  disputes.* 243  This  development  underscores  con-
cerns  about  the  erosion  of  Hong  Kong’s  independent  legal  system,
which  has  long  been  valued  by  international  businesses.244  It  fur-
ther  exacerbates  fears  of  the  diminishing  distinction  between  Bei-
jing’s and Hong Kong’s legal frameworks, raising apprehensions that
Hong  Kong’s  common  law  tradition  firmly  grounded  in  the “rule  of
law”  concept  is  increasingly  being  overshadowed  by  the  Mainland’s
“rule  by  law”  system,  which  treats  law  as  an  instrument  of  Party
control.† 245 The U.S. Department of State’s 2023 Investment Climate
Statements: Hong Kong echoes this view, warning that “while Hong
Kong’s  legal  system  had  been  traditionally  viewed  as  a  bastion  of
judicial independence, authorities have over the past year continued
to  place  pressure  on  the  judiciary  in  some  cases.  Rule  of  law  risks
that were formerly limited to mainland China have now increasing-
ly become a potential concern in Hong Kong.” 246

Already, politically charged legal rulings in Hong Kong are weigh-
ing  on  the  activities  of  foreign  tech  companies.  In  May  2024,  the
Hong Kong Court of Appeals sided with the Hong Kong government
in  ruling  that  the  protest  anthem  “Glory  to  Hong  Kong”  should  be
removed  from  digital  platforms,  including  those  from  U.S.-based
firms  Alphabet  (Google  and  YouTube),  Apple,  Meta  (Facebook  and
Instagram),  and  Spotify.247  This  is  the  latest  push  by  the  Hong
Kong  government  to  influence  the  activity  of  U.S.  digital  platforms
in  the  city,  inflaming  tensions  that  date  back  to  2020,  when  most
major U.S. companies announced they would pause processing data
requests  from  the  Hong  Kong  government  while  they  assessed  the
NSL.248  Since  that  announcement,  some  U.S.  firms  have  resumed
processing  requests  from  the  Hong  Kong  government  on  a  case-by-
case  basis.249  In  the  last  six  months  of  2023,  Meta  received  29  re-
quests from the Hong Kong government to obtain user data, and it
answered  one.250  In  the  first  six  months  of  2023,  Google  complied
with  82  of  the  Hong  Kong  government’s  requests  to  remove  items
from their services out of 162 filings, although Google specified that
it  chose  not  to  remove  two  YouTube  videos  and  one  Google  Drive
file  related  to “Glory  to  Hong  Kong.” 251  However,  under  a  court  or-
der  granted  in  May  2024,  some  platforms  have  begun  to  comply,
including YouTube, which promptly blocked access to “Glory to Hong
Kong” for its Hong Kong users.252

Foreign Firms Continue to Pull Back

While  the  full  impact  of  the Article  23  Ordinance  on  business  in
Hong  Kong  is  yet  to  be  determined,  businesses  continue  to  depart
Hong Kong, with the city’s sluggish economy increasingly subsumed
under  the  Mainland’s  authoritarian  government.253  Business  oper-

ations  in  Hong  Kong  used  to  be  “a  fairly  risk-free  matter,”  Simon
Cartledge, a research and publishing executive, told the Wall Street
Journal, but now “there are question marks over everything.” 254 The
number  of  global  companies  with  regional  headquarters  in  Hong
Kong has fallen 8.4 percent from 2019 to 2023, according to govern-
ment data, while the number of staff retained by these global firms
in  Hong  Kong  has  dropped  30  percent.255  During  the  immediate
months  preceding  the  implementation  of  the  Article  23  Ordinance,
several global entities that were weighing Hong Kong for their Asia
headquarters—including  Canadian  pension  fund  manager  Alberta
Investment Management Corp. (AIMCo), U.S. tech company Vantage
Data Centers, and the Cayman Islands government—all announced
their  intention  to  instead  place  their  Asia  headquarters  in  Singa-
pore.256 AIMCo’s  CEO  referenced  geopolitical  risks  in  an  interview
around the decision, while Vantage Data Centers is reportedly look-
ing  to  sell  their  data  centers  in  Hong  Kong  after  the  imposition  of
the Article 23 Ordinance.257 Financial services companies in partic-
ular  have  looked  to  other  regional  finance  hubs  like  Singapore  for
a  more  stable  business  environment,  according  to  AmCham  Hong
Kong.258 The  number  of  European  firms  has  also  declined  in  Hong
Kong,  with  an  increase  in  the  percentage  of  firms  reporting  they
have  decided  to  shift  or  have  already  shifted  existing  investments
out of China toward Southeast Asia and other locations.259

Even  as  some  U.S.  and  international  firms  avoid  Hong  Kong,
mainland Chinese companies continue to enter the city.260 In 2022,
Chinese  companies  for  the  first  time  outnumbered  U.S.  firms  with
regional  headquarters  in  Hong  Kong.261  InvestHK,  the  Hong  Kong
government’s bureau responsible for attracting foreign direct invest-
ment  (FDI),  noted  in  its  annual  report  that  of  the  firms  for  which
it  helped  open  operations  in  Hong  Kong  in  2023,  136  came  from
mainland  China  while  only  34  came  from  the  United  States.* 262
From 2020 to 2023, the total number of nonlocal firms with regional
headquarters in Hong Kong has now declined by 168, or 11 percent,
with U.S. firms declining the most.263

Hong  Kong  remains  the  largest  source  of  FDI  into  mainland
China.  However,  a  large  portion  of  FDI  that  appears  to  flow  from
Hong Kong to mainland China actually originates in mainland Chi-
na  itself.264  Mainland  Chinese  firms  take  advantage  of  tax  breaks
and  other  financial  incentives  to  set  up  offices  in  Hong  Kong  that
manage  their  investments  in  the  Mainland.265  As  firms  from  oth-
er  countries  pull  back  from  investing  in  China,  the  share  of  FDI
roundtripped through Hong Kong has increased.266

Tourists Avoid Hong Kong

Once  a  vibrant  international  tourist  destination,  Hong  Kong  is
failing  to  attract  visitors,  having  yet  to  attain  pre-COVID  levels.
Hong Kong eased its COVID restrictions early in 2023, allowing a
total  of  34  million  tourists  to  visit  throughout  the  year;  however,
by  December,  monthly  tourist  numbers  had  reached  just  65  per-

cent  of  pre-COVID  levels.267  As  of  the  most  recent  data  through
July 2024, total year-to-date visitors were still only at 70 percent
of  pre-COVID  levels.* 268  The  number  of  mainland  tourists,  who
make  up  the  bulk  of  total  arrivals,  was  around  69  percent  of  the
pre-pandemic  level  as  of  year-to-date  July  2024.269 Tourism  from
the United States and Europe also lags significantly.270 The num-
ber  of  U.S.  tourists  visiting  Hong  Kong  as  of  year-to-date  July
2024 was only 67 percent of the comparable figure for 2018, while
the  number  of  UK  tourists  was  only  49  percent.271 Tourism  from
these countries is unlikely to rise in the near term, as the United
States  has  joined  other  democracies  like  Canada  and  Australia
in  issuing  travel  advisories  characterizing  Hong  Kong’s  ongoing
implementation  of  its  national  security  laws  as  “broad”  and  “ar-
bitrary.” 272  Following  the  passage  of  the  Article  23  Ordinance,
the  Australian  government  expanded  its  advisory  to  warn  that
Australians  in  Hong  Kong “could  be  detained  without  charge  for
up  to  16  days  and  denied  access  to  a  lawyer  for  up  to  48  hours”
should they violate the ordinance’s broadly defined national secu-
rity offenses.273 With the drop in Western tourists to Hong Kong,
the Hong Kong tourism office is doubling down on efforts to draw
in  mainland  tourists  in  a  bid  to  boost  retail  and  consumption.274
The  2024–2025  Hong  Kong  budget  included  $141  million  (HKD
1.1  billion)  for  tourism  promotion  activities.275  Hong  Kong  busi-
nesses  are  adapting  as  well,  promoting  their  stores  on  Chinese
social media apps and ensuring websites are available in Manda-
rin  to  appeal  to  mainland  tourists.276

Hong Kong Increasingly Integrated with Mainland

Increasingly,  people  move  between  Hong  Kong  and  mainland
China.  These  changes  reflect,  in  part,  economic  incentives.  Rising
living  costs  continue  to  burden  working-class  Hong  Kongers,  who
increasingly  seek  economic  opportunities  in  mainland  China.277 As
Hong  Kongers  shop  and  travel  more  frequently  across  the  border,
mainland  Chinese  talent  continues  to  flow  into  Hong  Kong.278 The
movement  of  individuals  between  Hong  Kong  and  the  Mainland
is  facilitated  by  the  completion  of  cross-border  infrastructure,  in-
cluding  a  high-speed  train  system,  which  has  halved  travel  time
between  Hong  Kong  and  some  Chinese  cities.279  Additionally,  con-
sumer  goods  are  generally  cheaper  across  the  border  than  in  Hong
Kong.280  In  February  2024,  more  Hong  Kongers  traveled  to  neigh-
boring  Shenzhen  than  any  prior  February  since  recordkeeping  be-
gan  in  1984.281  Economists  at  Natixis  estimate  that  Hong  Kongers
will  spend  approximately  $10.8  billion  (HKD  84  billion)  in  Guang-
dong Province this year, with a significant portion allocated to food,
retail  sales,  and  other  commercial  activities.282  Moreover,  accord-
ing  to  an  annual  survey  performed  by  the  Hong  Kong  Institute  of
Asia-Pacific  Studies  at  the  Chinese  University  of  Hong  Kong,  the
percentage  of  Hong  Kongers  who  would  emigrate  to  the  Mainland
if  given  the  opportunity  has  risen  from  9.5  percent  in  2020  to  20.3
percent in 2023.283

ism Been Affected?” August 12, 2019.

Mainland  Chinese  talent  also  continues  to  pour  into  Hong  Kong,
dominating a new government visa program intended to attract for-
eign  workers.284  The  Top  Talent  Pass  Scheme,  launched  in  2022,
offers visas of up to two years to foreign workers earning more than
$320,000  (HKD  2.5  million)  or  graduates  of  the  world’s  top  uni-
versities.* 285  Despite  Hong  Kong  authorities  promoting  openness
to  a  wide  range  of  foreigners,  approximately  95  percent  of  appli-
cants have been mainland Chinese.286 Since the scheme’s inception,
roughly 55,000 mainland Chinese individuals have been granted ex-
tended visas in Hong Kong, many of whom have secured positions in
finance, IT, and commercial services.287 Workers entering under the
scheme  earn  a  median  income  over  twice  that  of  the  average  Hong
Kong  worker,  adding  many  highly  skilled  Chinese  workers  to  the
Hong Kong labor force.288 Moreover, the Hong Kong government has
taken steps to further boost short-term business from the Mainland.
In April  2024,  government  authorities  announced  that  the  limit  for
stays  for  visa  holders  from  mainland  China  visiting  Hong  Kong
would  double  to  14  days.289 This  move  complements  the  expansion
of  another  talent  program  in  2024,  which  now  permits  residents  of
Beijing, Shanghai, and the Greater Bay Area to apply for multi-en-
try  visas  to  Hong  Kong  that  allow  stays  of  up  to  30  days  if  the  ap-
plicant  specializes  in  certain  sought-after  industries.290 This  inflow
of  Chinese  workers  is  also  important  to  Hong  Kong’s  demograph-
ic  makeup,  which  continues  to  shed  young  people,  declining  from
21.3  percent  of  the  population  to  16.3  percent  between  2014  and
2023.291  The  Hong  Kong  population,  which  fell  in  the  years  after
protests  rocked  the  city  in  2019,  finally  grew  in  2022  and  2023.292
However,  growth  in  2023  was  fueled  by  a  special  permit  issued  to
40,800  mainland  Chinese  allowing  them  to  reside  in  Hong  Kong
permanently.293

Recruitment efforts by the Hong Kong government to attract low-
er-skilled laborers from the Mainland have encountered more mixed
success  and  faced  pushback  from  working-class  Hong  Kongers.294
The low-skilled labor market in Hong Kong currently faces a short-
age  of  approximately  30,000  workers,  particularly  in  roles  such  as
cooks  and  warehouse  workers,  as  highlighted  by  LegCo  member
Peter  Shiu.295  However,  Hong  Kong  companies  find  it  expensive  to
sponsor foreign low-skilled workers due to requirements mandating
that these workers be housed either in Hong Kong or mainland Chi-
na at the company’s expense.296 To address the workforce gaps, the
Hong Kong government is taking steps to attract mainland Chinese
individuals  to  take  up  positions  in  certain  blue-collar  industries
in  Hong  Kong,  eliciting  resistance  from  local  communities.297  For
instance,  CityBus,  a  transit  company  grappling  with  a  shortage  of
drivers, announced plans to recruit 20 mainland Chinese drivers at
salaries  less  than  two-thirds  of  their  Hong  Kong  counterparts.298
This  decision  drew  criticism  from  the  CityBus  Union,  which  raised
concerns  not  only  that  the  influx  of  mainland  workers  would  de-
press the salary prospects of local Hong Kong drivers but also that

for  the  visa. Applications  for  the  visa  are  made  directly  to  the  Hong  Kong  government. As  long
as  the  applicant  meets  the  eligibility  requirements,  they  can  stay  up  to  two  years  while  they

it would threaten safety due to mainland drivers being accustomed
to driving on the opposite side of the road and adhering to different
traffic regulations.299

Views toward Mainland China

Despite  these  growing  links,  most  Hong  Kongers  still  perceive
mainland  China  with  distrust,  as  evidenced  by  a  December  2023
Pew  poll  revealing  that  nearly  half  of  Hong  Kong  adults  per-
ceive  Chinese  power  and  influence  in  Hong  Kong  as  a  significant
threat.300  Notably,  this  sentiment  surpasses  concerns  about  the
United  States  by  11  percent.301  However,  a  substantial  majority  of
Hong  Kongers,  74  percent,  express  emotional  attachment  to  China,
underscoring  a  complex  relationship.302  While  persistent  tensions
remain  over  Beijing’s  political  crackdown  and  economic  domination
of Hong Kong, a majority of adults surveyed identify themselves as
both  Hong  Konger  and  Chinese.303  However,  this  sentiment  varies
across  demographics,  dissipating  among  the  younger  generation.304
Among  individuals  under  35  years  old,  who  were  a  driving  force
behind  the  2019  Hong  Kong  protests,  skepticism  toward  Chinese
influence is pronounced, with 57 percent considering China a major
threat.305  Notably,  less  than  half  of  this  demographic  group  claims
any  Chinese  identity,  highlighting  a  growing  disconnect  between
young  Hong  Kongers  and  China  despite  a  growing  number  of  this
demographic  being  born  in  Hong  Kong  after  its  1997  handover  to
China.306

Hong  Kong  Investment  Fund  Furthers  China’s  Innovation  and

Military Aims

Hong Kong takes advantage of its historical reputation as an ad-
herent to international norms and rule of law to attract investment
that  furthers  China’s  security  aims.307 The  Hong  Kong  Investment
Corporation (HKIC) sovereign wealth fund, created in October 2022,
will oversee the allocation of almost $8 billion to promote industrial
and  economic  development  in  four  target  areas,  including  fintech,
artificial intelligence, biotechnology, and high-end manufacturing.308
Hong  Kong’s  role  in  the  GBA  is  to  serve  as  a  bridge  between  the
nine  mainland  Chinese  cities  in  the  GBA  and  the  world,  attracting
talent,  capital,  and  innovation.309  Given  China’s  military-civil  fu-
sion  strategy,  however,  these  efforts  will  inevitably  support  China’s
military.310 For example, semiconductors are one of the technologies
the GBA has emphasized through the establishment of government
innovation  zones.311  This  is  an  area  where  the  United  States  and
allies are actively working to prevent China’s advancement because
of  the  military  implications.312  Despite  this,  the  zone  has  attracted
investment  from  a  leading  Swiss  semiconductor  company.313  Hong
Kong’s ability to attract Western investment is particularly concern-
ing  given  the  larger  military  connotations  of  the  GBA.  According
to  China’s  official  policy,  the  nine  GBA  cities  should  promote  “the
innovative  development  of  civil-military  integration.” 314  Smart-
More,  a  company  dual-headquartered  in  Hong  Kong  and  Shenzhen
and  developing  artificial  intelligence  solutions  for  manufacturing,
and  Shanghai-based  GeneSense,  an  artificial  intelligence-enabled
gene  sequencing  company,  both  received  investments  from  HKIC

713

in  2024.315  HKIC  has  announced  plans  for  additional  investments
in  biotechnology  to  support  industrial,  environmental,  agricultural,
and  medical  applications.316  HKIC  also  recently  announced  an  in-
vestment  in  a  Beijing-based  humanoid  robot  company  in  another
example of how Hong Kong’s investment efforts serve mainland Chi-
na’s innovation aims.317 (For more on China’s mission to develop ad-
vanced humanoid and quadruped robots, see Chapter 3, “U.S.-China
Competition in Emerging Technologies.”)

Hong Kong Slips as International Shipping Hub

While  Hong  Kong’s  infrastructure  integration  with  the  broader
GBA  has  deepened  through  expanded  infrastructure  projects  and
people-to-people  exchanges,  its  status  as  an  international  shipping
hub  continues  to  diminish.318  The  total  container  volume  passing
through  Hong  Kong’s  port  plummeted  to  14.3  million  twenty-foot
equivalent units (TEUs) in 2023, marking a significant 21.6 percent
decline  from  2019.319  Even  after  the  city  lifted  its  COVID-19  lock-
downs  and  resumed  international  travel,  data  for  the  fourth  quar-
ter  of  2023  reveals  a  further  contraction  in  container  transit,  with
port  cargo  throughput  decreasing  by  8.8  percent  compared  to  that
quarter  the  previous  year.320  Hong  Kong  fell  out  of  the  world’s  top
ten  busiest  container  ports  in  2023  for  the  first  time,  exemplify-
ing  the  city’s  waning  stature  in  international  business.321  Mean-
while,  several  mainland  Chinese  ports  continue  to  outrank  Hong
Kong as shippers bypass Hong Kong and ship directly into and out
of  the  Mainland.322 The  ports  of  Shanghai,  Ningbo,  Qingdao,  Shen-
zhen,  Guangzhou,  and Tianjin  now  outrank  Hong  Kong  in  terms  of
container  throughput  as  of  2024.323  This  decline  emphasizes  Hong
Kong’s diminishing advantages over other mainland cities compared
to its historical prominence as the world’s leading container port for
the majority of the years between 1987 and 2004.324

Hong Kong Serves as Key Hub for Transshipments and
Support to Russia

Despite its diminished status as a central shipping hub, Hong
Kong continues to play a crucial role as a node for illicit trans-
shipments  to  Russia  in  violation  of  U.S.  and  allied  sanctions,
with  cryptocurrency  payments  facilitating  this  illicit  trade.325
Bad  actors  are  taking  advantage  of  Hong  Kong’s  robust  busi-
ness  environment  to  evade  sanctions  by  quickly  dissolving
firms  targeted  by  Western  export  controls  and  reforming  new
firms  just  days  later.326  According  to  the  Silverado  Policy  Ac-
celerator,  a  bipartisan  think  tank,  exporters  from  China  and
Hong Kong shipped 85 percent of the semiconductors imported
by  Russia  between  March  2022  and  September  2023,  a  trend
that appears to have continued in 2024.327 In 2022 alone, Hong
Kong  ranked  as  Russia’s  second-largest  semiconductor  import
partner, shipping approximately $400 million worth of semicon-
ductors during the first year of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.328
Exporters in Hong Kong play a key role in shipping many oth-
er  components  to  Russia  as  well,  including  other  small  elec-

714

Support to Russia—Continued
tronic  components  that  are  used  by  the  Russian  military  to
manufacture  weapons  and  communication  systems.329

A 2023 report from the Carnegie Endowment for International
Peace identifies Hong Kong as a “transshipment hub for diverting
Western-made microelectronic components to companies affiliated
with the Russian military.” 330 This includes the diversion of chips
from top U.S. chipmakers such as Intel, Advanced Micro Devices,
and Texas Instruments to Russia.331 Hong Kong-based companies
have  also  been  implicated  as  suppliers  of  these  high-end  tech-
nologies  to  Russia.332  For  instance,  Pixel  Devices,  based  in  Hong
Kong, shipped at least $210 million in electronics to Russia from
April 2022 to May 2024, according to the U.S. Department of the
Treasury.333 U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken in May 2024
expressed significant concerns about Chinese support for Russia,
emphasizing that “Russia would struggle to sustain its assault on
Ukraine without China’s support.” 334

In response to these transshipment activities, Hong Kong com-
panies,  including  Pixel  Devices,  were  among  the  20  additional
Chinese  and  Hong  Kong  companies  named  in  U.S.  sanctions  for
aiding  the  development  of  Russia’s  industrial  and  military  base
in May 2024.335 Other Hong Kong-based firms also sanctioned for
supplying high-end technologies to Russia include Tulun Interna-
tional  Holdings,  which  is  involved  in  procuring  unmanned  aerial
vehicles,  and  CFU  Shipping,  a  logistics  firm  that  is  alleged  to
have  delivered  liquefied  natural  gas  modules  to  support  Russia’s
leading natural gas company.336

Hong Kong Organizations Lobby Overseas

Hong  Kong’s  international  representative  offices,  outposts  found-
ed  before  China’s  takeover  of  Hong  Kong,  promote  the  goals  of  the
Mainland and the Beijing-backed Hong Kong government abroad.337
Central  to  these  efforts  are  the  Hong  Kong  Economics  and  Trade
Offices (HKETOs), identified by the Hong Kong Democracy Council
(HKDC), a Washington, DC-based activist group, as a pivotal player
in  influencing  U.S.  policy  toward  Hong  Kong  and  China  through
an  extensive  lobbying  campaign.338  Importantly,  the  HKETOs  are
not  official  diplomatic  outposts  of  the  Chinese  government.339  The
HKETOs  were  established  before  the  handover  of  Hong  Kong  to
China  and  granted  immunities  and  diplomatic  protections  in  June
1997,  a  time  when  political  agreements  between  the  UK  and  Chi-
na  guaranteed  that  the  HKETOs  and  broader  Hong  Kong  interest
groups  would  maintain  autonomy  from  the  Chinese  government’s
goals.340  The  HKETOs  have  conducted  public  and  private  engage-
ments  in  Washington,  DC,  and  other  U.S.  cities  that  echo  Beijing’s
positions  on  Hong  Kong’s  political  and  legal  systems.* 341  The  ac-

* In  2022,  the  Commission  recommended  that  Congress,  pursuant  to  the  Hong  Kong  Human
Rights  and  Democracy  Act,  amend  the  International  Organization  Immunities  Act  to  remove

privileges  enjoyed  by  such  offices  and  their  employees  in  the  United  States.  This  amendment

tions of the HKETOs have further faced scrutiny globally, including
in  the  UK,  where  a  staffer  of  the  London  HKETO  was  arrested  for
allegedly  violating  the  UK  National  Security Act  and  assisting  for-
eign intelligence services between December 2023 and May 2024.342
The HKETO allegedly made bank payments from HKETO accounts
to  individuals  to  help  track  Hong  Kong  activists  who  are  living  in
the  UK.343  In  Germany,  a  former  employee  of  the  local  chapter  of
the Hong Kong Trade Development Council, a separate Hong Kong
trade promotion body, was also arrested and accused of carrying out
industrial espionage for Chinese intelligence services.344

Implications for the United States

Under  Beijing’s  authoritarian  control,  the  freedoms  of  press,
speech, and assembly that differentiated Hong Kong from mainland
cities are being eroded. Robust enforcement of the National Securi-
ty  Law  and  the  promulgation  of  the  new  Article  23  Ordinance  are
intended  to  coerce  the  public,  instill  uncertainty  and  fear,  and  cre-
ate  an  environment  of  self-censorship,  which  serves  as  a  form  of
lawfare. Local and foreign tourists, students, and residents in Hong
Kong can no longer be certain that their freedoms and rights will be
upheld by Hong Kong’s legal system or law enforcement.

The  extraterritorial  application  of  Hong  Kong’s  national  security
laws  also  stands  to  threaten  dissidents,  naturalized  citizens  living
abroad,  and  other  foreigners  who  sympathize  with  Hong  Kong,  in-
cluding  those  in  the  United  States.  These  individuals  face  harass-
ment and coercion despite residing in open democracies. Specifically,
the Article 23 Ordinance targets activists overseas by denying them
access  to  their  financial  assets  and  allowing  for  the  revocation  of
passports  and  professional  licenses,  among  other  things.  The  Ar-
ticle  23  Ordinance’s  new  offense  of  “external  interference,”  paired
with the threat of extreme sentencing, also intends to punish Hong
Kongers  and  dissidents  abroad  for  their  interactions  with  foreign-
ers.  The  Hong  Kong  government  also  targets  the  families  of  Hong
Kong  dissidents  who  still  reside  in  the  city.  This  relational  repres-
sion, along with the transnational repression of Hong Kongers over-
seas, will continue to worsen as the Article 23 Ordinance is enforced,
and  it  creates  a  potential  legal  conflict  between  the  United  States
and Hong Kong.

Amid  the  atmosphere  of  oppression  created  under  the  Article  23
Ordinance  and  Beijing’s  sustained  crackdown,  firms  operating  in
Hong  Kong  face  an  increasingly  restrictive  business  environment
that  is  reflective  of  conditions  on  the  Mainland.  This  includes  the
possibility  of  restrictions  on  research  and  due  diligence  and  the
looming  threat  that  standard  business  operations  by  foreign  firms
in  Hong  Kong  will  risk  accusations  of  collaboration  with  “external

could be reversed under one of the following conditions: China negotiates an agreement with the
United  States  to  have  Hong  Kong  Economic  and Trade  Offices  considered  an  official  part  of  the
People’s Republic of China’s mission to the United States and subject to the same requirements;
or  China  alters  its  treatment  of  Hong  Kong  to  allow  for  sufficient  autonomy  and  abides  by “one
country, two systems,” as enumerated by the Hong Kong Policy Act. In September 2024, the U.S.
House of Representatives passed the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office (HKETO) Certifica-
tion Act,  which  would  allow  the  U.S.  president  to  remove  HKETO  privileges  if  Hong  Kong  does
not maintain a significant degree of autonomy from China. Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office
(HKETO)  Certification Act,  H.R.1103,  February  17,  2023;  U.S.-China  Economic  and  Security  Re-

forces,”  involve  “state  secrets,”  or  otherwise  violate  the  Article  23
Ordinance  and  the  NSL.  Even  if  the  Hong  Kong  government  does
not  explicitly  punish  fact-based  reporting  of  Hong  Kong’s  economic
conditions  seen  as  “harmful”  to  China,  self-censorship  and  a  lack
of  transparency  among  auditors,  press,  firms,  and  other  industry
participants pose risks to investors. These risks are compounded by
Hong  Kong’s  increasingly  apparent  role  as  a  regional  hub  for  sanc-
tions  and  export  control  evasion.  Meanwhile,  Hong  Kong  continues
to  see  its  international  status  dwindle,  with  the  city  slipping  as  a
shipping  hub  and  its  markets  increasingly  dominated  by  mainland
rather than international firms. As the city continues to draw closer
to  its  mainland  neighbors  both  politically  and  economically,  it  re-
mains unclear how much distinctiveness and autonomy Hong Kong
can truly maintain.

COMPREHENSIVE LIST OF
THE COMMISSION’S 2024 RECOMMENDATIONS

Part II: Technology and Consumer Product

Opportunities and Risks

Chapter 3: U.S.-China Competition in Emerging Technologies
The Commission recommends:
  1.  Congress establish and fund a Manhattan Project-like program
dedicated  to  racing  to  and  acquiring  an  Artificial  General  In-
telligence  (AGI)  capability. AGI  is  generally  defined  as  systems
that  are  as  good  as  or  better  than  human  capabilities  across
all  cognitive  domains  and  would  surpass  the  sharpest  human
minds at every task. Among the specific actions the Commission
recommends for Congress:
 • Provide  broad  multiyear  contracting  authority  to  the  execu-
tive  branch  and  associated  funding  for  leading  artificial  in-
telligence,  cloud,  and  data  center  companies  and  others  to
advance the stated policy at a pace and scale consistent with
the goal of U.S. AGI leadership; and

 • Direct the U.S. secretary of defense to provide a Defense Pri-
orities  and  Allocations  System  “DX  Rating”  to  items  in  the
artificial intelligence ecosystem to ensure this project receives
national priority.

  2.  Congress consider legislation to:

 • Require  prior  approval  and  ongoing  oversight  of  Chinese  in-
volvement in biotechnology companies engaged in operations
in  the  United  States,  including  research  or  other  related
transactions.  Such  approval  and  oversight  operations  shall
be  conducted  by  the  U.S.  Department  of  Health  and  Human
Services in consultation with other appropriate governmental
entities.  In  identifying  the  involvement  of  Chinese  entities
or interests in the U.S. biotechnology sector, Congress should
include firms and persons:
 ○ Engaged in genomic research;
 ○ Evaluating  and/or  reporting  on  genetic  data,  including  for
medical  or  therapeutic  purposes  or  ancestral  documenta-
tion;

 ○ Participating in pharmaceutical development;
 ○ Involved with U.S. colleges and universities; and
 ○ Involved with federal, state, or local governments or agen-

cies and departments.

(733)

734

 • Support  significant  Federal  Government  investments  in  bio-
technology  in  the  United  States  and  with  U.S.  entities  at
every  level  of  the  technology  development  cycle  and  supply
chain, from basic research through product development and
market  deployment,  including  investments  in  intermediate
services capacity and equipment manufacturing capacity.

  3.  To  protect  U.S.  economic  and  national  security  interests,  Con-
gress  consider  legislation  to  restrict  or  ban  the  importation  of
certain technologies and services controlled by Chinese entities,
including:
 • Autonomous  humanoid  robots  with  advanced  capabilities  of

(i) dexterity, (ii) locomotion, and (iii) intelligence; and

 • Energy infrastructure products that involve remote servicing,
maintenance, or monitoring capabilities, such as load balanc-
ing  and  other  batteries  supporting  the  electrical  grid,  bat-
teries  used  as  backup  systems  for  industrial  facilities  and/
or  critical  infrastructure,  and  transformers  and  associated
equipment.

  4.  Congress  encourage  the  Administration’s  ongoing  rulemaking
efforts  regarding  “connected  vehicles”  to  cover  industrial  ma-
chinery,  Internet  of  Things  devices,  appliances,  and  other  con-
nected  devices  produced  by  Chinese  entities  or  including  Chi-
nese technologies that can be accessed, serviced, maintained, or
updated remotely or through physical updates.

  5.  Congress enact legislation prohibiting granting seats on boards
of  directors  and  information  rights  to  China-based  investors  in
strategic  technology  sectors.  Allowing  foreign  investors  to  hold
seats and observer seats on the boards of U.S. technology start-
ups  provides  them  with  sensitive  strategic  information,  which
could  be  leveraged  to  gain  competitive  advantages.  Prohibiting
this practice would protect intellectual property and ensure that
U.S. technological advances are not compromised. It would also
reduce  the  risk  of  corporate  espionage,  safeguarding  America’s
leadership in emerging technologies.

  6.  Congress establish that:

 • The  U.S.  government  will  unilaterally  or  with  key  interna-
tional  partners  seek  to  vertically  integrate  in  the  develop-
ment and commercialization of quantum technology.

 • Federal  Government  investments  in  quantum  technology
support  every  level  of  the  technology  development  cycle  and
supply  chain  from  basic  research  through  product  develop-
ment  and  market  deployment,  including  investments  in  in-
termediate services capacity.

 • The  Office  of  Science  and  Technology  Policy,  in  consultation
with  appropriate  agencies  and  experts,  develop  a  Quantum
Technology Supply Chain Roadmap to ensure that the United
States  coordinates  outbound  investment,  U.S.  critical  supply
chain assessments, the activities of the Committee on Foreign
Investment in the United States (CFIUS), and federally sup-
ported  research  activities  to  ensure  that  the  United  States,

735

along  with  key  allies  and  partners,  will  lead  in  this  critical
technology  and  not  advance  Chinese  capabilities  and  devel-
opment.

Chapter 4: Unsafe and Unregulated Chinese Consumer Goods:
Challenges in Enforcing Import Regulations and Laws

The Commission recommends:
  7.  With  respect  to  imports  sold  through  an  online  marketplace,
Congress  eliminate  Section  321  of  the  Tariff  Act  of  1930  (also
known as the “de minimis” exemption), which allows goods val-
ued  under  $800  to  enter  the  United  States  duty  free  and,  for
all  practical  purposes,  with  less  rigorous  regulatory  inspection.
Congress  should  provide  U.S.  Customs  and  Border  Protection
adequate  resources,  including  staff  and  technology,  for  imple-
mentation, monitoring, and enforcement.

  8.  Congress  amend  the  Consumer  Product  Safety Act  to  (1)  grant
the  U.S.  Consumer  Product  Safety  Commission  (CPSC)  unilat-
eral  mandatory  recall  authority  over  products  where  the  Chi-
nese  seller  is  unresponsive  to  requests  from  the  CPSC  for  fur-
ther information or to initiate a voluntary recall and the CPSC
has  evidence  of  a  substantial  product  hazard,  defined  as  either
failing  to  comply  with  any  CPSC  rule,  regulation,  standard,  or
ban or posing a substantial risk of injury to the public; and (2)
classify  Chinese  e-commerce  platforms  as  distributors  to  allow
for  enforcement  of  recalls  and  other  safety  standards  for  prod-
ucts sold on these platforms.

  9.  Congress direct the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and
U.S.  Customs  and  Border  Protection,  in  conjunction  with  the
U.S.  Department  of  Commerce,  to  develop  assessment  tools  ca-
pable  of  identifying  the  true  origins  of  parts,  components,  and
materials  contained  in  products  entering  the  United  States  to
prevent  tariff  evasion  and  limit  safety  and  security  risks  in
light of the increasing complexity of global supply chains.
10.  Congress require that the U.S. Trade Representative, in consul-
tation  with  the  U.S.  Department  of  Commerce,  the  U.S.  Inter-
national Trade  Commission,  and  other  entities,  as  appropriate,
prepare a comprehensive report within 90 days on the operation
of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement since its entry into
force that provides data and information on:
 • Chinese-affiliated  investments  in  Mexico  and  Canada  and
specific  information  on  their  production  of  goods  and  how
those  goods  may  enter  the  U.S.  market  either  as  finished
products or as components in other products;

 • Trade  flows  of  products  produced  in  China  to  Mexico  and

Canada and how such trade flows have changed;

 • Prices  of  products  produced  in  China  shipped  to  Mexico  and
Canada  as  well  as  products  shipped  through  those  countries
to the United States and how those prices relate to the prices
of such goods shipped directly into the U.S. market; and

 • Trade  enforcement  actions  by  Mexico  and  Canada  regarding
Chinese-produced  products  (including  those  transshipped

736

through  third  countries’  markets)  and  how  such  actions  re-
late to U.S. trade enforcement actions.

11.  Congress  amend  applicable  laws  to  mandate  that  online  mar-
ketplaces  clearly  disclose  on  product  listings  for  Chinese-made
goods  the  name,  physical  address,  and  contact  information  for
the  manufacturer.  The  online  marketplaces  should  also  be  re-
quired to clearly display a warning label that the item is man-
ufactured in a country that does not comply with U.S. consumer
safety standards.

12.  Congress  direct  the  U.S.  Government  Accountability  Office  to
investigate the reliability of safety testing certifications for con-
sumer products and medical devices imported from China.

Part III: Competition and Conflict

Chapter 5: China and the Middle East
The Commission recommends:
13.  Congress  direct  the  Office  of  the  Director  of  National  Intelli-
gence  to  produce  and  provide  to  the  U.S.  Department  of  the
Treasury  within  six  months  a  detailed  study  of  Chinese  pur-
chases  of  Iranian  oil  over  the  span  of  the  last  five  years.  The
study  shall  include  analysis  of  China’s  use  of  transshipment
points  and  shell  companies  as  methods  to  insulate  itself  from
sanctions. Congress should further direct that within six months
of  receipt  of  the  study,  the Treasury  Department  must  make  a
determination if sanctionable activity is occurring and report its
findings to Congress.

14.  Congress direct the U.S. member on the International Maritime
Organization  (IMO)  Council  to  use  their  voice  and  vote  to  re-
quire  China  to  abide  by  its  treaty  obligations  under  the  IMO
conventions,  including  by  upholding  safety  regulations  on  the
use of Automatic Identification System transponders.

Chapter  6:  Key  Economic  Strategies  for  Leveling  the  U.S.-

China Playing Field
The Commission recommends:
15.  Congress consider legislation to eliminate federal tax expendi-
tures for investments in Chinese companies on the Entity List
maintained by the U.S. Department of Commerce, or identified
as  a  Chinese  military  company  on  either  the  “Non-Specially
Designated  National  (SDN)  Chinese  Military-Industrial  Com-
plex  Companies  List”  maintained  by  the  U.S.  Department  of
the  Treasury  or  the  “Chinese  military  companies”  list  main-
tained  by  the  U.S.  Department  of  Defense.  Among  the  tax
expenditures  that  would  be  eliminated  prospectively  are  the
preferential  capital  gains  tax  rate,  the  capital  loss  carry-for-
ward provisions, and the treatment of carried interest.

16.  To enhance the effectiveness of export controls, Congress should:
 • Improve the analytic and enforcement capabilities of the U.S.
Department  of  Commerce’s  Bureau  of  Industry  and  Security
(BIS) by providing resources necessary to hire more in-house

737

experts;  establish  a  Secretary’s  Fellows  Program  to  more  ef-
fectively attract interagency talent; expand partnerships with
the  national  labs;  increase  access  to  data  and  data  analysis
tools,  including  the  acquisition  of  proprietary  datasets  and
modern  data  analytic  systems;  and  hire  additional  agents
and analysts for the Office of Export Enforcement.

 • Amend the Export Control Reform Act to require that within
30  days  of  granting  a  license  for  export  to  entities  on  the
Entity List, including under the Foreign Direct Product Rule,
BIS  shall  provide  all  relevant  information  about  the  license
approval to the relevant congressional committees, subject to
restrictions on further disclosure under 50 U.S.C. § 4820(h)(2)
(B)(ii).

 • Direct the president to:

 ○ Designate  a  senior  official  to  coordinate  efforts  across  the
Administration to prioritize bilateral and multilateral sup-
port for U.S. export control initiatives; and

 ○ Establish a Joint Interagency Task Force, reporting to and
overseen by the national security advisor and with its own
budget and staff, to assess ways to achieve the goal of lim-
iting  China’s  access  to  and  development  of  advanced  tech-
nologies  that  pose  a  national  security  risk  to  the  United
States.  The  task  force  should  include  designees  from  the
U.S.  Departments  of  Commerce,  Defense,  State,  Treasury,
and  Energy;  the  intelligence  community;  and  other  rele-
vant agencies. It should assess the effectiveness of existing
export  controls;  provide  advice  on  designing  new  controls
and/or using other tools to maximize their effect while min-
imizing their negative impact on U.S. and allied economies;
and  recommend  new  authorities,  institutions,  or  interna-
tional  arrangements  in  light  of  the  long-term  importance
of U.S.-China technology competition.

 • Codify  the  “Securing  the  Information  and  Communications
Technology  and  Services  Supply  Chain”  Executive  Order  to
ensure that as the authority is used more robustly, challenges
to  its  status  as  an  executive  order  will  not  constrain  BIS’s
implementation decisions or delay implementation.

17.  Congress  direct  the  Administration  to  create  an  Outbound  In-
vestment  Office  within  the  executive  branch  to  oversee  invest-
ments  into  countries  of  concern,  including  China.  The  office
should  have  a  dedicated  staff  and  appropriated  resources  and
be tasked with:
 • Prohibiting outbound U.S. investment through a sector-based
approach  in  technologies  the  United  States  has  identified  as
a threat to its national or economic security;

 • Expanding the list of covered sectors with the goal of aligning
outbound investment restrictions with export controls. The of-
fice should identify and refine the list of covered technologies
in coordination with appropriate agencies as new innovations
emerge; and

738

 • Developing  a  broader  mandatory  notification  program  for
sectors  where  investment  is  not  prohibited  to  allow  policy-
makers  to  accumulate  visibility  needed  to  identify  potential
high-risk  investments  and  other  sectors  that  pose  a  threat
to  U.S.  national  or  economic  security.  In  addition  to  direct
investments,  the  notification  regime  should  capture  passive
investment  flows  to  help  inform  debates  around  the  expan-
sion of prohibitions to cover portfolio investment.

18.  Congress repeal Permanent Normal Trade Relations (PNTR) for
China. The PNTR status allows China to benefit from the same
trade terms as U.S. allies, despite engaging in practices such as
intellectual property theft and market manipulation. Repealing
PNTR  could  reintroduce  annual  reviews  of  China’s  trade  prac-
tices,  giving  the  United  States  more  leverage  to  address  unfair
trade  behaviors. This  move  would  signal  a  shift  toward  a  more
assertive  trade  policy  aimed  at  protecting  U.S.  industries  and
workers from economic coercion.

19.  Congress  direct  relevant  departments  and  agencies  to  expand
their  data  collection  and  transparency  initiatives  into  the  vol-
ume  and  types  of  investment  flowing  into  China  by  taking  the
following actions:
 • Amending  the  International  Investment  and  Trade  in  Ser-
vices Survey Act to require the Bureau of Economic Analysis
within  the  U.S.  Department  of  Commerce  to  publish  more
detailed  sectoral  breakdowns  of  U.S.  direct  investment  in
China on a nationality basis and the U.S. Department of the
Treasury to publish annual sector breakdowns of U.S. portfo-
lio  investment  in  China  on  a  nationality  basis. The  portfolio
investment sectors should be more specific than those provid-
ed  by  the  Commerce  Department  for  direct  investment.  Ad-
ditionally, Congress should require the Treasury Department
to publish quarterly updates—without sector breakdowns—of
nationality-based portfolio investment in China.

 • Requiring  the  U.S.  Department  of  Commerce  to  produce  a
report  on  the  feasibility  and  methodology  for  publishing  na-
tionality-based  results  for  direct  investment,  where  offshore
tax  havens  and  locales  of  incorporation  would  not  be  said  to
receive  hundreds  of  billions  of  dollars  and  true  destinations
of the capital would be accurately identified.

20.  Congress direct the Administration to impose sanctions on Chi-
nese financial institutions that violate sanctions, including those
that  are  proven  to  be  working  with  or  supporting  the  Russian
military industrial base or facilitating purchases of Iranian oil.
21.  In  light  of  the  periodic  and  increasingly  frequent  removal  of
some of these materials from Chinese websites, Congress direct
the  executive  branch  to  fund  the  creation  and  operation  of  a
regularly  updated,  permanent  data  archive,  in  effect  a  series
of  snapshots  of  portions  of  the  Chinese  internet.  In  the  past
decade,  foreign  analysts  have  made  use  of  open  source  Chi-
nese-language  materials  to  gain  insight  into  various  aspects  of
current  policy  as  well  as  internal  (but  unclassified)  discussions

739

of  future  military,  diplomatic,  and  economic  strategy.  Informa-
tion  would  be  stored  in  the  permanent  data  archive,  accessible
to both government and private analysts.

22.  Congress  consider  legislation  to  set  priorities  and  goals  for
U.S.-China economic relations. These policy priorities and goals
should include:
 • Updating  existing  trade  and  economic  tools  to  ensure  their
timely  application,  utility,  and  effectiveness  in  countering
China’s non-market economic policies;

 • Limiting  U.S.  economic  and  security  dependence  on  supply
chains  in  critical  and  emerging  products,  technologies,  and
services  provided  by  companies  controlled,  operating  in,  or
subject to the influence of China;

 • Enhancing the accountability of the executive branch to Con-
gress and increasing the transparency of its actions to ensure
coordinated  governmental  action  and  respect  for  Congress’s
constitutional Article I, Section 8 authority;

 • Prioritizing  domestic  production  and  employment  while  also
recognizing the need, as appropriate, to coordinate and align
policies with friends and allies;

 • Acting  to  address  production  overcapacity  fueled  by  Chinese

policies and actions; and

 • Advancing the resilience of the U.S. economy and ensuring its

access to key inputs and technologies.

23.  Congress  pass  legislation  eliminating  the  ability  of  entities
operating  in  U.S.  Foreign-Trade  Zones  (FTZs)  to  qualify  for
zero  or  lower  tariffs  on  products  imported  from  China  or  Chi-
nese-affiliated  or  -invested  entities  into  the  FTZ  and  then  re-
exported.

24.  The  relevant  committees  of  Congress  hold  hearings  to  assess
the  desirability  and  feasibility  of  creating  a  trade  defense  co-
alition  with  other  like-minded  countries  to  forestall  the  risk
of a second China shock. Such a grouping would seek to align
policies for responding to the recent acceleration in China’s ex-
ports  of  subsidized,  underpriced  materials  and  manufactured
goods.

Chapter  7:  China’s  New  Measures  for  Control,  Mobilization,

and Resilience

The Commission recommends:
25.  Congress  direct  the  Office  of  the  Director  of  National  Intelli-
gence, within 180 days, to conduct a classified assessment, and
brief  its  findings  to  Congress,  of  the  intelligence  community’s
(IC)  ability  to  accurately  monitor  strategic,  nonmilitary  indi-
cators  that  would  signal  that  China  is  preparing  for  immi-
nent  conflict  and  the  extent  to  which  China’s  increasing  lack
of  transparency  affects  the  IC’s  ability  to  monitor  this  infor-
mation. The  assessment  should  include,  but  not  be  limited  to,
the following:

740

 • The IC’s ability to monitor:

 ○ China’s energy storage locations and stockpiling rates, par-

ticularly for crude oil, coal, and natural gas;

 ○ Production shifts from civilian to military industries;
 ○ China’s national defense mobilization system; and
 ○ China’s  strategic  reserves  and  their  compositions  and  lo-

cations;

 • The IC’s ability to coordinate with non-Title 10 and -Title 50
federal  agencies  that  have  technical  expertise  in  agriculture
and trade to monitor China’s food and energy stockpiling and
any  derived  indicators  that  may  signal  a  potential  prepara-
tion for conflict;

 • Whether  the  IC’s  current  geospatial  intelligence  posture  is
adequate  to  compensate  for  the  loss  of  open  source  informa-
tion from China; and

 • The  desirability  and  feasibility  of  establishing  an  Energy
Strategic Warning system involving coordination between rel-
evant  entities  including  the  National  Geospatial-Intelligence
Agency  and  the  U.S.  Departments  of  Energy,  Commerce,
State, and the Treasury.

Chapter 8: China’s Evolving Counter-Intervention Capabilities

and the Role of Indo-Pacific Allies

The Commission recommends:
26.  Congress  direct  the  U.S.  Department  of  Defense  to  produce
within  60  days  a  classified  net  assessment  report  on  current
People’s  Liberation Army  (PLA)  Command,  Control,  Communi-
cations,  Computers  Intelligence,  Surveillance,  and  Reconnais-
sance (C4ISR) capabilities and PLA electronic warfare (EW) ca-
pabilities  (including  electronic  attack  and  electronic  protection
capabilities).  The  report  should  examine  U.S.  counter-C4ISR
and  counter-EW  capabilities,  assess  the  resiliency  of  U.S.  capa-
bilities,  identify  counter-C4ISR  and  counter-EW  gaps,  and  pro-
vide a menu of procurement options to close the gaps. Not later
than  60  days  after  its  completion,  the  U.S.  secretary  of  defense
shall  provide  the  report  to  the  appropriate  congressional  com-
mittees and brief them on its findings.

27.  Congress  direct  the  Office  of  the  Director  of  National  Intelli-
gence,  in  conjunction  with  the  U.S.  Departments  of  Defense,
Commerce,  and  the  Treasury,  and  other  relevant  agencies,  to
conduct  a  comprehensive  review  of  potential  technological
chokepoints  across  the  People’s  Republic  of  China  military  in-
dustrial base and devise plans to apply controls, in conjunction
with allies, to slow China’s military development.

28.  Congress  reinvigorate  and  recommit  to  space  as  an  area  of
strategic  competition,  including  by  conducting  a  review  of  the
commercial space industry to determine if there are regulatory
updates  that  would  ensure  that  the  U.S.  commercial  space  in-
dustry is able to innovate as quickly as possible while maintain-
ing safety as a top priority.

741

Part IV: Taiwan and Hong Kong

Chapter 9: Taiwan
The Commission recommends:
29.  Congress amend the Arms Export Control Act of 1976 to include

Taiwan on the list of “NATO Plus” recipients.

30.  Congress  create  a  “Taiwan  Allies  Fund”  that  would  provide
foreign  assistance  only  to  countries  that  have  an  official  diplo-
matic  relationship  with Taiwan.  No  country  could  receive  more
than  15  percent  of  the  appropriated  funding  each  year.  Coun-
tries that no longer have a diplomatic relationship with Taiwan
would immediately be ineligible for this funding.

Chapter 10: Hong Kong
The Commission recommends:
31.  Congress  require  the  Administration  to  produce  a  determina-
tion  whether  reasonable  grounds  exist  for  concluding  that  the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region should be designated
as  a  Primary  Money  Laundering  Concern  (PMLC)  jurisdiction
under  Section  311  of  the  Patriot Act  due  to  its  growing  role  as
the central sanctions evasion hub and transshipment center for
illicit finance and technology to Russia, Iran, and North Korea.
32.  Congress  direct  the  U.S.  Department  of  the  Treasury,  in  coor-
dination  with  the  U.S.  Departments  of  State  and  Commerce,
to  provide  the  relevant  congressional  committees  a  report  as-
sessing  the  ability  of  U.S.  and  foreign  financial  institutions
operating  in  Hong  Kong  to  identify  and  prevent  transactions
that  facilitate  the  transfer  of  products,  technology,  and  money
to  Russia,  Iran,  and  other  sanctioned  countries  and  entities  in
violation of U.S. export controls, financial sanctions, and related
rules. The report should:
 • Evaluate  the  extent  of  Hong  Kong’s  role  in  facilitating  the
transfer  of  products  and  technologies  to  Russia,  Iran,  other
adversary countries, and the Mainland, which are prohibited
by export controls from being transferred to such countries;
 • Evaluate Hong Kong’s role in facilitating trade and financial
transactions  that  violate  U.S.  sanctions  on  Russia,  Iran,  and
other countries and entities subject to U.S. financial sanctions;
 • Examine  whether  Hong  Kong’s  National  Security  Law  has
limited the ability of financial institutions to adhere to global
standards  for  anti-money  laundering  and  know-your-custom-
er procedures; and

 • Describe  the  level  of  cooperation  between  Hong  Kong  and
U.S.  authorities  in  enforcing  export  controls  and  sanctions
regimes.

ADDITIONAL VIEWS OF COMMISSIONER
ROBIN CLEVELAND

In  2009,  Senator  Mitch  McConnell  (R-KY)  first  appointed  me  to
the Commission. I am grateful to the Leader who has supported my
effort over many years to serve with integrity and always speak my
mind. The trust he has placed in me changed my life profoundly.

I also have been honored to serve alongside a distinguished group
of Commissioners who contribute wisdom and energy to this import-
ant effort. The greatest privilege, however, is to learn from the dedi-
cated, knowledgeable staff who bring language skills, deep expertise,
curiosity,  and,  most  of  all,  patience  with  the  Commissioners  as  we
work toward a consensus of views.

This  year,  I  voted  for  the  report  and  believe  it  largely  builds  on
the  Commission’s  record  of  understanding  and  providing  policy
recommendations  regarding  China’s  efforts  to  consolidate  control
domestically  and  expand  its  authority  globally.  Regrettably,  there
are  two  aspects  of  the  report  that  reach  beyond  our  commitment
to  provide  China-based  recommendations  and  raise  concerns  about
unanticipated repercussions.

While  I  support  suspension  of  the  de  minimis  trade  exemption
specifically for Chinese e-commerce products because of concerns re-
garding  safety  hazards,  forced  labor,  lack  of  enforcement  related  to
counterfeit products, and the imbalance of the exemption level (U.S.
exemption is $800; China is $7), I disagree with the decision to elim-
inate the provision in its entirety for e-commerce imports. Based on
the  most  recent  data  available  from  Customs  &  Border  Protection
authorities,  42  percent  of  de  minimis  imports  come  from  countries
other than China. The Commission has spoken repeatedly about the
need  to  strengthen  relations  with  emerging  markets  as  we  seek  to
balance  China’s  predatory  political  and  economic  practices. The  de-
cision  to  eliminate  the  de  minimis  exemption  for  e-commerce  sales
from  all  countries  was  taken  without  consideration  of  the  poten-
tial  damage  that  may  be  done  to  our  relationships  with  Southeast
Asian, Latin American, European, and African trading partners.

My  second  concern  relates  to  our  recommendation  to  eliminate
capital  gains,  capital  loss  carry-forward  provisions,  and  the  treat-
ment  of  carried  interest  for  U.S.  companies. This  proposal  was  nei-
ther  presented  nor  discussed  in  any  Commission  hearing,  policy
paper,  or  witness  statement.  While  I  agree  with  the  spirit  of  the
concern  that  the  United  States  should  restrict  investments  in  dan-
gerous  Chinese  military  enterprises,  the  implementation  and  con-
sequences  of  this  provision  have  not  been  evaluated. The  provision
mirrors  a  previous  recommendation  that  appeared  designed  to  in-
flict harm on the U.S. private sector without clarity on the actual, if
any, impact on Chinese enterprises which present a threat.

CONFLICT  OF  INTEREST  AND  LOBBYING
DISCLOSURE  REPORTING

The  Commission  seeks  to  hold  itself  to  the  highest  standards  of
transparency  in  carrying  out  its  mission.  In  accordance  with  its
policy  for  avoiding  conflicts  of  interest,  Commissioners  who  believe
they  have  an  actual  or  perceived  conflict  of  interest  must  recuse
themselves  from  the  source  or  subject  matter  of  the  conflict.  The
following  Commissioners  recused  themselves  from  the  portions  of
the 2024 Report cycle below.

 • Commissioner  Jonathan  N.  Stivers  recused  himself  from  Com-
mission  activities  that  include  the  direct  participation  of  the
Committee  for  Freedom  in  Hong  Kong  (CFHK)  Foundation,
including  a  Commission  briefing  relating  to  Hong  Kong  which
included an employee of the CFHK Foundation.

 • Commissioner Michael R. Wessel recused himself from Commis-
sion  activities  relating  to  the  following  two  matters:  the  trade
remedy  cases  involving  certain  solar  imports  from  Cambodia,
Malaysia,  Thailand,  and  Vietnam  filed  in  April  2024  and  the
Section  301  case  relating  to  shipbuilding  sectors  filed  March
2024.

Lobbying  disclosure  reports  filed  by  any  Commissioners  who  en-
gage  in  “lobbying  activities”  as  defined  by  the  Lobbying  Disclosure
Act  in  connection  with  their  outside  employment  activities  may  be
accessed  via  public  databases  maintained  by  the  House  (https://
lobbyingdisclosure.house.gov/)  and  Senate  (https://lda.senate.gov/

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

The Commission would like to express its deep appreciation to those who testified
as  expert  witnesses,  the  researchers  and  analysts  who  prepared  papers  under  con-
tract, and the representatives from the executive branch and others who briefed the
Commissioners  on  a  wide  array  of  economic  and  security  issues. All  of  these  efforts
informed the Commission and the public debates on issues vital to ongoing U.S.-Chi-
na relations.

The  Commission  offers  it  special  thanks  to  General  Michael  E.  Kurilla,  U.S.  Cen-
tral  Command;  General  Bryan  P.  Fenton,  U.S.  Special  Operations  Command;  then
Acting Director Jeremy Cornforth, American Institute in Taiwan; then Deputy Chief
of Mission Raymond F. Greene, U.S. Embassy in Tokyo; and Admiral Samuel J. Pap-
aro, U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, and their staffs for their outstanding support of the
Commission’s fact-finding trips this year.

The  Commissioners  are  deeply  grateful  to  the  service  and  expertise  of  the  staff
who  develop  materials  for  our  hearings,  research  papers,  and  Annual  Report.  Each
person brings a unique perspective, expertise, and dedication to the Commission and
country, which every Commissioner has benefited from as we seek to understand U.S.
relations  with  China.  We  are  also  grateful  to  the  congressional  and  administrative
teams, which offer experienced and capable support ensuring the Commission’s hear-
ings, congressional engagement, and daily operations run smoothly.

Finally,  the  Commissioners  express  their  thanks  to  Erin  Mulligan,  who  served  as
a copyeditor of the Report, to Tyler Loveless, who served as a fact-checker of the Re-
port,  to  former  Security  and  Foreign Affairs  Director Anastasya  Lloyd-Damnjanovic,
and to former staffers Andrew Hartnett, Nicholas Kaufman, Lauren Menon, and Au-
brey Waddick who each made significant contributions to the 2024 Report cycle. The
Commissioners are especially grateful to former executive director Daniel W. Peck for
his leadership of the Commission’s staff (2018–2024).
